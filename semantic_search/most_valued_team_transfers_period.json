    "text": "\n The Scout looks at the transfer trends of  Fantasy Premier League  managers and picks out the best differentials ahead of the start of the 2022/23 season. \n Midfielders \n Mohamed Salah  (\u00a313.0m) is the go-to midfielder in Fantasy, with his 56.4 per cent ownership more than double any other player in his position. \n There is far more variety elsewhere in managers\u2019 midfields, with only three others selected by over 20 per cent of managers. \n Salah\u2019s  Liverpool  team-mate  Luis Diaz  (\u00a38.0m) has emerged as the most popular mid-priced pick, while  Tottenham Hotspur \u2019s  Son Heung-min  (\u00a312.0m) is another favourite in the premium bracket. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n And  Fulham \u2019s  Andreas Pereira  (\u00a34.5m) is the preferred budget option following his summer move from  Manchester United .\u00a0 \n As a result, there are plenty of overlooked players who could prove to be standout differentials in the early stages of the new campaign.\u00a0 \n Jack Grealish (MCI) \u00a37.0m \n The  Manchester City  winger has been quick to find his form, supplying the assist for Erling Haaland\u2019s (\u00a311.5m) debut winner against Bayern Munich last week. \n Although he managed just three goals and three assists in his debut campaign for Man City last season, Grealish\u2019s underlying numbers are encouraging.\u00a0 \n Indeed, his 41 shots in the box and 53 chances created both placed among their top five players.\u00a0 \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the \u00a3100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n At a cost of \u00a37.0m, he can be found in a mere five per cent of squads ahead of a favourable early schedule. \n The champions are the only side who avoid all of last season\u2019s top six in the first six Gameweeks.\u00a0 \n James Maddison (LEI) \u00a38.0m\u00a0 \n Leicester City \u2019s playmaker enjoyed his best-ever Fantasy campaign last term, amassing 181 points thanks to 12 goals and 11 assists. \n Maddison\u2019s all-round influence on the Foxes\u2019 attack is further highlighted by his statistics. \n His totals of 72 shots, 33 shots on target and 48 chances created were all more than any team-mate. \n The 25-year-old is owned by just over five per cent of managers ahead of  home meetings with Brentford  and  Southampton  in the first three Gameweeks. \n Yet Maddison thrived in the corresponding fixtures in 2021/22, claiming double-figure hauls on each occasion.\u00a0 \n Daniel Podence (WOL) \u00a35.5m \n A kind early run of opponents lifts the value of  Wolverhampton Wanderers \u2019 key players in Fantasy. \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), four of their first six matches score just two. \n Pedro Neto  (\u00a35.5m) has emerged as a popular target for opening squads, boasting an ownership of 19 per cent. \n Yet not only is Podence the same price, he has matched Neto\u2019s output of three goals and an assist over the summer. \n Sitting in under one per cent of squads, Podence is an enticing option in the sub-\u00a36.0m bracket. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Sa among overlooked goalkeepers Part 2:  Versatile Zinchenko can thrive at Arsenal Part 4:\u00a0 Back Vardy in kind home fixtures \n",

    "text": "\n The FA, Premier League and EFL are together introducing new measures and stronger sanctions across the game to tackle the increased anti-social and criminal behaviours recently seen within football grounds and underline the importance of a safe matchday environment.\u00a0 \n The new set of actions, which will be implemented across all English football leagues from the start of Season 2022/23 and backed by the Football Supporters\u2019 Association, will target activity such as entering the pitch without permission, carrying or using smoke bombs or pyrotechnics and throwing objects - as well as drug use and discriminatory behaviour.\u00a0\u00a0 \n These acts are dangerous, illegal and have severe consequences. They have no place in football, or anywhere. \n \n \n \u274c Entering the pitch  \u274c Use of flares & smoke bombs  \u274c Throwing objects \u274c Discriminatory behaviour \u274c Taking drugs Football is coming together to bring in strong measures to tackle antisocial and criminal behaviour:  https://t.co/FbftQnEt8x #LoveFootball   #ProtectTheGame   pic.twitter.com/a4tzmvxT7i \n\u2014 Premier League (@premierleague)  July 25, 2022 \n \n From the start of Season 2022/23, all identified offenders will be reported by clubs to the police and prosecution could result in a permanent criminal record, which may affect their employment and education, and could result in a prison sentence. The FA will also be enforcing a tougher charging and sanctioning policy for clubs, which will reinforce these measures . \u00a0\u00a0 \n Furthermore, anyone who enters the pitch and those identified carrying or using pyrotechnics or smoke bombs will now receive an automatic club ban. These bans could also be extended to accompanying parents or guardians of children who take part in these activities.\u00a0\u00a0 \n The safety of everyone attending a matchday is the game\u2019s collective priority. We know the behaviours carried out by some fans last season do not represent the majority of supporters and they risk ruining the fantastic experience of a football match for everyone. Therefore, we are working with clubs to highlight the important role that fans, clubs, players and coaches all have to play in helping to create a safe environment. \u00a0 \u00a0 \n Our strong and collective approach reflects how seriously we all view this issue and the severity of the risks.\u00a0Nobody should be intimidated or assaulted in their workplace. The pitch must remain safe for players, managers and match officials, just as the stands should be for supporters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \"If we don\u2019t take collective and sustained action, it may only be a matter of time before someone is seriously injured, or worse\" \n \n Richard Masters, Premier League CEO \n \n \n \n To further support this action, The FA, Premier League and EFL are working with police forces, the UK Football Policing Unit (UKFPU), and the Crown Prosecution Service to establish a new principle for cases relating to pyrotechnics and smoke bombs, as well as entering the pitch without permission. This will mean cooperating to achieve a prosecution in these cases will become the default response of the football authorities and criminal justice system, sending a clear and unambiguous message to all who break the law.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n Other measures to be implemented include working with clubs to enhance search regimes and increased use of sniffer dogs at grounds. We will also be working in partnership with our clubs, players and managers, the Government, broadcasters, the police and social media platforms in seeking to discourage the further growth or acceptance of these behaviours across English football. This includes working with social media platforms to establish new ways of quicker removal of fan-generated videos of illegal behaviour at football matches, including violent offences and pitch invasions. It also includes asking the Government to reform regulations to restrict the supply of pyrotechnics and smoke bombs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n There are new measures and strong sanctions to tackle the increased anti-social and criminal behaviours recently seen in football grounds \u27a1\ufe0f  https://t.co/Lsk7Qnlayp #LoveFootball  |  #ProtectTheGame   pic.twitter.com/zAdxFa6LaG \n\u2014 Premier League (@premierleague)  August 5, 2022 \n \n Premier League Chief Executive Richard Masters said:  \u201cEveryone should feel safe and able to enjoy a football match. Together, with clubs and partners across football, we are making clear the type of incidents we saw last season must stop. If we don\u2019t take collective and sustained action, it may only be a matter of time before someone is seriously injured, or worse. \u00a0\u00a0 \n \"These new measures are a strong response to a significant increase in fan behaviour issues, but we know it is the minority who have behaved unacceptably and unlawfully. Premier League football should be a fantastic experience for everyone and we don\u2019t want matches to be marred by these sorts of events in the future.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \n FA Chief Executive Mark Bullingham said:  \"We all know about the fantastic and unique role that football can play in bringing communities together. However, the rise in anti-social behaviour that we saw in stadiums at the end of last season was entirely unacceptable and put people\u2019s safety at risk. Together, English football has introduced new measures and stronger sanctions, for the start of the coming season, to send out a clear message that we will not tolerate this type of illegal and dangerous behaviour. \n \"Football stadiums must be a safe, inclusive and enjoyable environment for all, and it is the responsibility of everyone in the game, including governing bodies, clubs, players, coaches, and fans, to ensure that we all play our part in protecting our game and each other.\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \"Pyro and pitch incursions are illegal, you will be prosecuted and you will be banned by your club\" \n \n Football Supporters' Association Chief Executive Kevin Miles \n \n \n \n EFL Chief Executive Trevor Birch\u00a0said:  \u201cThis season sees new measures introduced and sanctions implemented that will serve to remind everyone attending games - but particularly the minority of people behaving in an offensive manner - that there are real life consequences for the criminal, dangerous and irresponsible conduct at football. It is wholly appropriate that these unacceptable behaviours will now be dealt with through a combination of police action and automatic club bans. \n \"There is nothing like going to watch your team live and that is why the English professional game has taken strong collective action, to ensure the match day experience remains a safe and welcoming environment for all including fans, players, club staff and match officials.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n Football Supporters' Association Chief Executive Kevin Miles said:  \"We are contacted by supporters on a fairly regular basis who have been caught jumping on the pitch, or with pyro in the stands, and without exception they regret doing it.\u00a0 \n \"Whether they had positive intentions or not is irrelevant in the eyes of the law - pyro and pitch incursions are illegal, you will be prosecuted and you will be banned by your club.\"\u00a0 \n To support this new package of policies and actions, today marks the launch of an all-football campaign. \n \" Love football. Protect the game \" \u00a0 will make clear the consequences of, and sanctions for, illegal and dangerous behaviour as we seek to urge fans to help us protect the game and keep everyone safe.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n",

The new Centres will operate for at least 30 weeks per season and will commence from September 2022. \n The Centres will be underpinned by five key areas: 1. Better accessibility 2. More inclusivity 3. Reducing the impact of early selection 4. More focused investment 5. Providing more appropriate challenges \n Earlier this year, the Premier League confirmed it will provide \u00a31.75million per annum for the next three years to support the new network of Girls\u2019 ETCs. \n Kay Cossington, The FA\u2019s Head of Women\u2019s Technical, said: \"Our key aims are to provide greater access for more players whilst diversifying the talent pool, and I am delighted that the early signs show that we are well on track to achieve those aims. \n \"We are extremely excited to be working alongside such a diverse group of clubs and organisations, which will help us identify players for the future, including future England Lionesses.\u201d \n Premier League Chief Football Officer Tony Scholes said: \"The Premier League and our clubs are committed to developing football at all levels and it is important that girls across the country have greater opportunities to progress in the game. \n \"We are pleased to have provided the funding which will significantly enhance the pathways for young female footballers, and it is great to see the first licences allocated for the new Emerging Talent Centres.\u201d \n Licences were allocated on a regional basis allowing for greater geographical coverage, whilst providing greater accessibility for a larger pool of players. \n The breakdown of confirmed licences can be found on The FA website.\u00a0 \n In addition to those licences already confirmed, The FA will be staging a second invitational application window for eligible clubs and organisations in targeted areas to further support the aim of greater geographical coverage and access. \n For more information regarding the Girls\u2019 ETC programme please contact  playerpathway@thefa.com \n",

Instead, Awoniyi uses his strength and quality to overpower central defenders. \n Awoniyi goals 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Type \n Number \n \n \n \n \n Right foot \n 10 \n \n \n Left foot \n 5 \n \n \n Through-balls \n 8 \n \n \n Penalties \n 2 \n \n \n Outside the box \n 1 \n \n \n Tap-in \n 1 \n \n \n Intercepting backpass \n 1 \n \n \n Latching on to second ball \n 1 \n \n \n Finishing from square pass \n 1 \n \n \n \n Forest have also recruited a striker who likes to press defenders and force mistakes. \n Awoniyi won the ball back himself to start goal-ending sequences five times for Union Berlin last season. \n No other player in Germany's top flight could top that. \n Cooper's side will be eager to create as many chances as they can from regains made in advanced areas of the field. \n Bundesliga's most prolific strikers 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Non-penalty goals per match \n \n \n \n \n Patrick Schick \n 1 \n \n \n Robert Lewandowski \n 0.9 \n \n \n Erling Haaland \n 0.8 \n \n \n Anthony Modeste \n 0.7 \n \n \n Christopher Nkunku \n 0.6 \n \n \n Serge Gnabry \n 0.6 \n \n \n Taiwo Awoniyi \n 0.5 \n \n \n Stefan Jovetic \n 0.5 \n \n \n \n Awoniyi scored 0.53 non-penalty goals per 90 minutes last term, which placed him among the leading lights in the Bundesliga. \n With that kind of strike-rate it is easy to see why he was of interest to Forest this summer. \n The front man did spend six years as a Liverpool player between 2015 and 2021 and was loaned out to several clubs around Europe throughout that period. \n Despite developing well as an all-round player Awoniyi did not plunder more than seven league goals in a season for any of those sides, managing only 13 in 89 appearances across the three campaigns that preceded 2021/22. \n Last season was his breakthrough year, scoring 20 goals for Union Berlin in all competitions, including four in the UEFA Europa Conference League. \n To succeed at the City Ground, Awoniyi must hit the ground running and build on the confidence he has right now. \n From a tactical perspective he is tailor-made to shine at the top end of the pitch for Forest. \n See:   Talking Tactics: New signings for 2022/23 \n",

He loves to get tight to front men and muscle his way past them to break up play. \n Across Europe\u2019s top five leagues last season, he was ranked in the top three per cent for defenders making interceptions. \n Bella-Kotchap stats 2021/22 \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n Ave. per 90 \n Percentile* \n \n \n \n \n Interceptions \n 3.3 \n 97% \n \n \n Pressures \n 12.9 \n 91% \n \n \n Clearances \n 5.8 \n 89% \n \n \n \n *Percentile ranking among defenders in Europe's top five leagues \n The youngster uses his powerful frame to good effect, pressurising forwards as often as possible. \n This leads to the occasional error, where a striker will turn him to get goal-side, but Bella-Kotchap\u2019s combative style is generally successful. \n Most aerial duels won in Bundesliga \n \n \n \n 2021/22 \n Club \n Headers won \n \n \n \n \n Konstantinos Mavropanos \n Stuttgart \n 81.8% \n \n \n Josuha Guilavogui \n Wolfsburg \n 77.8% \n \n \n Dan-Axel Zagadou \n Dortmund \n 76.1% \n \n \n Armel Bella-Kotchap \n Bochum \n 74.4% \n \n \n Mohamed Simakan \n RB Leipzig \n 74.2% \n \n \n \n Southampton\u2019s summer signing is 6ft 2in tall and a dominant presence in the air. \u00a0 \n He is comfortable on the left or right side of a centre-back pairing and wins the bulk of his headers. \u00a0 \n Last season he had the fourth-highest win ratio in the air, prevailing in 74.4 per cent of his aerial duels. \u00a0 \n None of Saints defenders Bednarek (70 per cent), Salisu (62.3 per cent),  Lyanco  (57.6 per cent) or  Jack Stephens  (52 per cent) could match that success rate. \n Scope for development \n It is easy to see why Southampton wanted to invest in this promising talent, who should suit their style of defending under Hasenhuttl. \u00a0 \n He will instantly add competition for places, probably battling it out with Bednarek or Lyanco for a place next to first-choice centre-back Salisu. \n There could be the occasional bump in the road for this young defender as he adapts to English football. But his strong, uncompromising approach is likely to make him a crowd-pleaser at St Mary\u2019s. \n See:   Talking Tactics: New signings for 2022/23 \n",

His longest goalless stretch last season was five matches. \n Leading the line for  Pep Guardiola\u2019s  attacking side will virtually guarantee that Haaland receives a glut of quality chances. \n Running in behind the defence \n Haaland\u2019s pace and movement will give Man City a new dimension. \n When they use an attacking midfielder as a \"false nine\", City rely on slick interplay and runners from deep to exploit the spaces created. \n Haaland will offer more of a direct threat. He loves to make runs beyond the last defender and is at his devastating best when there is room to surge into. \n Out of his 61 Bundesliga goals, 25 have come from situations where he has run into space ahead of him to shoot, a 41 per cent share of his total output. \n Haaland's goal variety \n \n \n \n Goal types \n % of Haaland's goals \n \n \n \n \n Running into space \n 41.0% \n \n \n Converting crosses \n 31.0% \n \n \n Others \n 16.5% \n \n \n Penalties \n 11.5% \n \n \n \n Under Guardiola, Man City are excellent at getting into areas where they send a stream of low crosses or passes across the face of goal. \n That will suit Haaland, who has a nose for tap-ins. \n While his heading ability has improved this term, he scores more regularly when getting on the end of low crosses at close range. \n He makes clever movements in the box and is strong enough to brush off defenders to bundle the ball home inside the six-yard box. \n Getting the best from Haaland\u00a0 \n I doubt Guardiola will alter his successful approach completely following Haaland's arrival, but there is likely to be a tactical tweak. \n This season, I'd expect to see City play a greater number of early, progressive forward passes for their signing to run on to, with the use of a \"false nine\" less prevalent. \n Haaland is a generational talent who can take the Premier League by storm when  the 2022/23 season kicks off on 6 August . \n His early summer capture is a real sign of intent from the champions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n See:   Talking Tactics: New signings for 2022/23 \n",

This would perhaps suit Sterling more than playing up top on his own. \n Sterling\u2019s most likely role will be on the left of a three-man attack, joining in as a second centre-forward at various intervals. \n Sterling & Chelsea 21/22 comparison \n \n \n \n Mins/goal (Goals) \n Touches in opp. box/90 \n \n \n \n \n Sterling \n 163.6 (13) \n Sterling \n 8.9 \n \n \n Lukaku \n 191.8 (8) \n Werner \n 8.1 \n \n \n Pulisic \n 214.3 (6) \n Havertz \n 6.7 \n \n \n Mount \n 214.9 (11) \n Lukaku \n 5.8 \n \n \n Havertz \n 226.3 (8) \n Hudson-Odoi \n 5.6 \n \n \n \n Provided that he adapts to his new surroundings, Sterling will enhance Chelsea\u2019s goal threat in 2022/23. \n His pace and dribbling skills force defenders to backpedal, and this should help to provide added penetration for the team. \n Mohamed Salah  is the only Premier League player to have enjoyed more touches inside the opposition box per 90 minutes last season. \n Tellingly, in 2021/22, despite it being not one of his best, Sterling still scored at a much faster rate than anyone in Chelsea\u2019s team. \n Wherever he plays in Tuchel\u2019s forward line, Sterling will strike fear into Chelsea\u2019s opponents. \n See:   Talking Tactics: New signings for 2022/23 \n",

Indeed, they are the only side who avoid all of last season\u2019s top six in the first six Gameweeks. \n Kane overlooked \n The rush to bring in Haaland and Jesus has made  Harry Kane  (\u00a311.5m) a major differential. \n Fewer than 16 per cent of managers own the  Tottenham Hotspur  forward, who looks a strong armband option  at home to Southampton  and  Wolverhampton Wanderers  in the first three Gameweeks. \n Kane was a huge success after the arrival of Antonio Conte as head coach in Gameweek 11 last season. \n His total of 167 points from that moment until the end of the season was bettered by only two other players in Fantasy. \n Line up Liverpool differentials? \n Elsewhere,  Liverpool  pair  Darwin Nunez  and  Diogo Jota  (both \u00a39.0m) have been largely overlooked due to the popularity of their team-mates. \n Reds trio Trent Alexander-Arnold (\u00a37.5m), Mohamed Salah (\u00a313.0m) and Luis Diaz (\u00a38.0m) are all owned in over 32 per cent of squads.\u00a0 \n Certainly, the arrival of Darwin from Benfica increases the chances of rotation in the lone-striker role at the start of 2022/23, with the Uruguayan initially expected to share minutes with Jota. \n Cheap options \n Finally, managers have turned to  Leeds United \u2019s  Sam Greenwood  and  Nottingham Forest \u2019s  Lyle Taylor  (both \u00a34.5m) as a means of freeing up budget.\u00a0 \n Neither player has been a first-team regular, which suggests they have simply been purchased to sit on managers\u2019 benches, allowing them to spend funds elsewhere. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 Most popular players Part 2:\u00a0 Raya and Sanchez the budget favourites Part 3:\u00a0 Premium defenders dominate Part 4:\u00a0 Managers flock to Diaz \n Don't miss an FPL deadline again \n",

    "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at the impact of players who have joined new clubs in the 2022 summer transfer window.\u00a0 \n Sven Botman (NEW) \n Sven Botman is one of European football's most promising young central defenders, who will instantly enhance the quality of  Newcastle United 's backline. \n The 22-year-old Dutchman helped Lille win the Ligue 1 title in 2020/21, shining as a dominant centre-back who operates on the left side of a pair. \n Technically strong and comfortable on the ball, a by-product of his education in the Ajax academy system, the 1.98 metre defender should be an asset to the Magpies in and out of possession. \n Big figure at the back \n He is a physically commanding presence who uses his height and strength to good effect. \n In last season's Ligue 1 campaign, Botman won a hugely impressive 73.3 per cent of his aerial duels. \n That ranked him seventh in the division and it is a ratio that compares favourably with Newcastle's centre-backs from last season. \n Newcastle defenders comparison* \n \n \n \n Player \n Headers won % \n \n \n \n \n Jamaal Lascelles \n 74.2 \n \n \n Sven Botman \n 73.3 \n \n \n Federico Fernandez \n 66.7 \n \n \n Dan Burn \n 65.4 \n \n \n Ciaran Clark \n 63.4 \n \n \n Fabian Schar \n 51.7 \n \n \n \n *data from 2021/22 \n Botman will engage with strikers anywhere inside his own half but he is at his best when dropping off deep to defend his penalty area. \n When rival teams hoist hopeful balls into his domain, he backs himself to win his individual battles with opposition centre-forwards. \n Positionally sound, he confidently uses his powerful frame to win those all-important first contacts. \n During Lille's run in the UEFA Champions League (UCL) last term, Botman outlined his control in this facet of the match, ranking sixth for aerials won per 90 minutes. \n UCL's leading headers 21/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Aerial duels won/90* \n \n \n \n \n Gerard Pique \n 5.0 \n \n \n Jules Kounde \n 4.6 \n \n \n Virgil van Dijk \n 3.8 \n \n \n Merih Demiral \n 3.4 \n \n \n Joel Matip \n 3.3 \n \n \n Sven Botman \n 3.0 \n \n \n \n *Min five starts \n If he lines up alongside fellow left-footer  Dan Burn  at the heart of Newcastle's back four, it will be interesting to see which one of them is moved away from that side of the unit. \n Irrespective of that tactical call, head coach  Eddie Howe \u00a0will be reassured by their collective ability to repel aerial raids. \n Need to stay compact \n Botman's height and sturdy physique mean that he does have limitations when up against speedy forwards. \n In 1v1s in wide areas he can look uncomfortable, especially if opponents make him twist or turn. \n It will be down to Newcastle United as a team to ensure they do not become so stretched on a regular basis. \n If they stay compact, Botman will look a far more composed and distinguished central defender.\u00a0 \n Tidy on the ball \n He will confidently carry the ball forward before making a pass, often driving towards the midfield before releasing it. \n Assured in possession, Botman was accurate with 88.1 per cent of his passes last term. \n He does mix up his distribution too, displaying a noticeable improvement in his long-range passing for Lille in 2021/22. \n Completing 77.7 per cent of his long passes, compared with 71.6 per cent in their title-winning campaign, he can accurately pick out a forward from distance. \n He is a modern defender with a string of attributes that should help make Newcastle a stronger team this season. \n See:   Talking Tactics: New signings for 2022/23 \n",

It then combines this data with each team's home and away form over the past six fixtures.\u00a0 \n This creates a value that offers a perceived difficulty for each team when facing them home and away. \n These values are then simplified into ratings from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest difficulty value. \n Red alert \n If you view information for any player, either in your squad or in the player list, and check out their fixtures, you will see the FDR represented. \n Colour coding is used to help portray the FDR value, with green depicting a low-difficulty fixture and red the highest. \n The ratings are reviewed after each Gameweek, although major changes will not be applied immediately until home and away form for each team is more established. \n Even so, the FDR provides guidance on players who enjoy runs of fixtures that could promote their FPL points hauls. \n Ahead of each Gameweek, articles will use the FDR to identify teams with such runs, to help guide your short and mid-term transfer decisions. \n",

They face only one of last term\u2019s top seven in their subsequent seven matches. \n Other options \n Haaland and Man City team-mate  Riyad Mahrez  (\u00a38.0m) offer further options with the potential for huge hauls. \n Arsenal  pair  Martin Odegaard  (\u00a36.5m) and  Kieran Tierney  (\u00a35.0m), along with  West Ham United 's  Said Benrahma  (\u00a36.0m) and  Michail Antonio  (\u00a37.5m), will be fresh ahead of kind schedules for both clubs. \n Tottenham Hotspur 's  Dejan Kulusevski  (\u00a38.0m) and  Crystal Palace 's  Wilfried Zaha  (\u00a37.0m) will also not feature in Qatar and could prove popular during the unlimited free transfer period. \n See:  Fantasy Premier League 2022/23 is live \n",

    "text": "\n Adrian Clarke highlights players who are set to build on a debut campaign full of promise and set alight the Premier League this season. \n Trevoh Chalobah (CHE) \n At the age of 22, following three loan spells away from Stamford Bridge, academy graduate Chalobah finally made his breakthrough as a  Chelsea  first-team player last season. \n Thomas Tuchel  handed him 17 Premier League starts in total, while also trusting him to feature in his line-ups for the finals of the UEFA Super Cup, League Cup and FA Cup. \n On the right side of a back three Chalobah was largely excellent for the Blues. \n \n \n A season breakdown: Trev Edition! \ud83d\udcda His end of term report... \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb \n\u2014 Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC)  June 8, 2022 \n \n There were a couple of dips in form but overall the rookie was a big success, alternating with  Cesar Azpilicueta  in that wide centre-back role. \n With  Antonio Rudiger  and  Andreas Christensen  leaving the Blues this summer, we should see plenty more of Chalobah in 2022/23.\u00a0 \n Progressive passing \n Chelsea's central defenders have the ball at their feet a lot more than most and Chalobah, who makes 71.43 successful passes per 90 minutes, is very comfortable with that requirement. \n If there is space ahead of him to run into, he will surge forward, but it is his willingness to look up and play a vertical pass that stands out most. \n Only a handful of other top-flight defenders can top his 27.8 forward passes per match. \n Forward passes in 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Defender \n Forward passes per 90 \n \n \n \n \n Adam Webster \n 34.0 \n \n \n Thiago Silva \n 31.4 \n \n \n Romain Saiss \n 31.1 \n \n \n Nathan Ake \n 30.4 \n \n \n Aymeric Laporte \n 28.3 \n \n \n Trevoh Chalobah \n 27.8 \n \n \n Virgil van Dijk \n 27.7 \n \n \n \n Only two defenders from the above list also make the top five for pass accuracy. \n Not only willing to take a risk by moving the ball in a progressive direction, Chalobah is also reliable in the precision of his distribution from the back. \n Technically, he is more than capable of excelling at the highest level. \n Best pass accuracy 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Defender \n Passing accuracy % \n \n \n \n \n Aymeric Laporte \n 94.76 \n \n \n Ruben Dias \n 93.38 \n \n \n Thiago Silva \n 92.75 \n \n \n Daniel Amartey \n 90.75 \n \n \n Trevoh Chalobah \n 90.62 \n \n \n \n Chalobah also provided a goal threat in 2021/22, scoring three times in Premier League action.\u00a0 \n He drilled home a long-range strike on debut  at home to Crystal Palace  and followed that up with headers from corners  against Southampton  and  Norwich City . \n Averaging an effort on goal once every two matches, Chalobah has the potential to score between five and 10 goals this season if he earns a regular starting berth. \n Snappy in the tackle \n While Tuchel sees Chalobah as a central defender, he did enjoy spells as a central midfielder on loan at Ipswich Town, Huddersfield Town and Lorient. \n That versatility could come in handy for Chelsea during his second campaign as a fully-fledged member of the first-team squad. \n If the Blues need an extra body in midfield during the second half of a match, Chalobah could seamlessly move forward, or come straight into the fray as a midfielder off the bench. \n Central defender tackles 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Most tackles won per 90 \n \n \n \n \n Cristian Romero \n 1.90 \n \n \n Pascal Struijk \n 1.71 \n \n \n Trevoh Chalobah \n 1.68 \n \n \n Joel Veltman \n 1.50 \n \n \n Mohammed Salisu \n 1.42 \n \n \n \n Chalobah's background in midfield has helped him become a combative presence. \n Only two top-flight centre-backs won more tackles per match last term than the emerging star. \n It is never easy for youngsters to build on a successful debut season at first-team level but Chalobah should take great heart from his promising displays last season. \n If he continues to improve, Tuchel will hand him plenty more opportunities to shine. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 Michael Olise (CRY) Part 2:\u00a0 Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (LEI) Part 3:  Joe Gelhardt (LEE) \n",

    "summary": "Adrian Clarke speaks to Leicester's Chris Davies about the secrets of helping a first-team manager",
    "text": "\n The Premier League has a vision to develop a world-leading coaching development system by elevating the quality of coaching across the English system through its\u00a0 Elite Coaching Plan .\u00a0\u00a0 \n As part of this, we are showcasing in a series of articles how the Premier League is leading a positive change in the global perception of our coaching at academy and first-team levels, as well as increasing the diversity of the coaching workforce. This includes interviews with some of the talented coaches coming up the ranks at Premier League clubs.\u00a0 \n Earlier this year, Adrian Clarke, spoke to Leicester City's\u00a0Chris Davies, one of the most highly respected and successful young coaches in English football. \n Chris Davies (LEI) \n In 12 years working alongside  Brendan Rodgers , first as a member of the backroom staff at Swansea City and  Liverpool , before becoming his assistant at Celtic and  Leicester City , the former Reading youth team player has played a part in several notable achievements. \n Still only 37, Davies' CV includes a promotion from the Championship, a role in one of the most exciting Premier League title races this century, back-to-back domestic trebles in Scotland and the masterminding of a first ever FA Cup Final triumph for Leicester. \n Taking time out of his busy schedule, Davies provides a wonderful insight into what it is like to be an assistant manager. \n Here, he breaks down his role and responsibilities, as well as telling us what he has learned as a No 2. \n Training ground dynamics \n \"I will lead the training day to day. That means I'll plan the sessions and manage the other coaches  Kolo Toure  and Adam Sadler on it, plus goalkeeping coach Mike Stowell. I'll then present my ideas to Brendan every morning. Normally it's, 'Good, happy with that,' and off we go,\" says Davies. \n \"Brendan will oversee and observe the training sessions. He will only intervene when he feels there is something he needs to say. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"Over the years he has gone from being really hands-on, taking pretty much every training session, to now trusting the staff more to deliver what he wants before picking his moments to come in. \n \"When it comes to the day before a match, things are different. Brendan will lead that session with the players. \n \"That's his game-planning day where the final details are laid out for the players. As the manager, he is rightly at the forefront of putting across those messages. It is something he has always done. \n Session plans \n \"As coaches we are all guided by the game model the manager puts in place. We know what sort of team we want to create, so there are specific details we are trying to cover each day. \n \"We've built up a huge database of session plans that are all bespoke to us, which is so useful. In the last few years, for logistical reasons, I've transferred from handwritten sessions to computer database sessions and it saves me hours! \n \"The challenge for myself and for all coaches is to make sure we are adding variety. You must stay open-minded to other types of sessions and learning from other content, so we can keep bringing new things to the table. \n \"If players have seen it all and your repertoire is used up, things can go stale. \n \"One thing Brendan and I have always done is engage with the existing staff, too. At Celtic, for example, we leant on John Kennedy, who is a brilliant coach, with some great ideas and sessions of his own. \n \"Sadler was already here at Leicester and he's great. I'll also go on courses and conferences as often as I can. \n \n \n \"\"If we are asking the players to perform and deliver at the very highest level then we, as a coaching staff, need to demand that of ourselves, and make sure we are at the very highest level too. You can't stand still.\"\" \n \n Chris Davies \n \n \n \n More than an assistant \n \"A big part of my job is to make sure Brendan only hears what is absolutely necessary or relevant. The assistant needs to be a buffer. \n \"Managers at this level can get saturated with information and too many tedious little things \u2013 and that's not what they need. If somebody has got an issue and I can deal with it, then I will always try to do that and encourage them to come to me first. \n \"To be fair to Brendan, he's got a huge energy for work and a real interest in every part of the club. He's always open to people knocking on his door, but an assistant's job is try and protect the manager. \n \"I want to help him make the big-money decisions with the clearest mind possible. \n Pre-match responsibilities \n \"I don't like it when an assistant goes around waving their arms and telling everyone what to do on a match day. Let the manager manage. By doing that, you give his words more weight and authority with the players. \n \"Before a game, I like to remind people of their jobs and reinforce the manager's current message, whatever that may be. \n \"I feel I'm pretty good at motivating the players, so I can be quite vocal and loud inside the dressing room. That said, sometimes you need to be softer and talk to them about calmness and having the confidence to get on the ball and play. \n \"It's our job to feel that emotional atmosphere inside the room. \n \"Personally, I also like to go around individually to embrace each player before they go out, to get a sense of what they need. \n \"Do they need that bit of edge from me? Or do they need someone to tell them it's all going to be alright? We must make sure the players are in the optimal place when they go out onto the pitch to do their jobs. \n In-game coaching \n \"During games I take a step back and focus on things from a strategic point of view. I don't like to get too involved emotionally in this decision, that decision. \n \"I've got a little thing I write on a notepad WIHH (What Is Happening Here). \n \"It's my way of coming out of the battle and looking at this from a purely tactical point of view. What is going on in this game? What does our team need? \n \"I'll advise on that throughout the game with Brendan and try to add some value. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"At half-time the four of us will sit around together and chat for five minutes, while the players are settling down, before Brendan delivers his message. \n \"In the second half, it's primarily about substitutions, that's the main way you can affect the game. I may talk to the physios to check in on the physical status of certain players during this period too. \n \"You are making judgment calls under pressure in grounds that have big atmospheres, so there isn't time for long-winded debates. \n \"When I talk to Brendan during the game, it has got to be snappy, to the point and have a good rationale.\" \n The value of experience in analysis \n \"All my experience was in youth coaching before taking a position as opposition analyst at Swansea when I was 25, and it was the best thing I could ever have done. \n \"In those five years [two at Swansea, three at Liverpool], my confidence grew enormously in terms of tactical awareness. \n \"To have real genuine knowledge meant I could go to a  Steven Gerrard , a  Jordan Henderson , any top player, with confidence, and talk to them about the game and be able to give them advice. \n \"I'm so pleased I did that job. There were times while I was doing it that I was wishing I was out there on the grass as a coach, but I wouldn't change it for the world. \n \"When I ended up at Reading as assistant manager, at the age of 30, I realised how valuable that job had been. Straightaway, I felt I could hold my own in conversations about tactics. My confidence soared and suddenly everything felt easy.\" \n Developing players \n \"I like to spend quality time analysing opponents and our own game. Those are the hard yards you need to put in, to deliver high-quality content and information back to the players. Analysing a match properly takes me three hours. \n \"Ever since my time at Liverpool, I've had individual player meetings and it's something I have continued since I became an assistant. \n \n \n \"\"I especially like working with midfielders because it was where I played, and it's probably the most complex position on the pitch in terms of the spaces around you.\" \n \n Chris Davies \n \n \n \n \"When I've got some clips to show them, I'll ask a player to come and meet me for a quick chat. It'll only usually be a 15-minute meet-up, where I pick out three things, max. \n \"Usually, I'd split my observations into two areas; decision-making and execution. Decision-making is tactics. Execution is technique. \n \"That development time, in the classroom if you like, is the most connection I have ever found with a player. \n \"By taking the time to go into detail about ways they can improve and feeding it back to them; that's a really strong relationship-builder between player and coach. \n \"They feel like you've gone the extra mile to help them and that's what players appreciate.\" \n Fine balance \n \"Because of the spotlight and exposure players are under, I am always very conscious about how I need to act and what I need to say, depending on whether the team is going well or not. \n \"Top-level players are under tremendous scrutiny these days. Every pass they make can be seen and discussed around the world, with people critiquing everything they have or haven't done, so having empathy with them is crucial. \n \"If it goes too far and you become a cheerleader 'not going to help them though. \n \"There's a fine balance that I've got better with, the more experience I have gained.\" \n Key ingredient \n \"If there is one quality you need to build from to be a good assistant manager, it is loyalty. Trust has to be base. \n \"Without it, the manager can never relax and know you've got his back. I pride myself on loyalty and trust above anything else. I'm here to support the manager every day, in whatever way I can. \n \n \n \"\"We are all part of the same team, the same club, we all want the same thing but there are internal dynamics at play so it's important that I protect Brendan. I also need to lead at the right times too.\" \n \n Chris Davies \n \n \n \n \"I don't see myself as an assistant in that sense. I see myself as a leader and I like to take on that role.\" \n Understanding your position \n \"You work very hard and dedicate yourself to the job, but it isn't actually your team and it's vital you remember that. \n \"As an assistant you have to be respectful of the boundaries and be aware it isn't your team. It belongs to the manager. They have all the pressure and responsibility. \n \"There's a bit of art to it, I guess.

    "summary": "Adrian Clarke speaks with boyhood Leeds fan now first-team coach on his role and future ambitions",
    "text": "\n The Premier League has a vision to develop a world-leading coaching development system by elevating the quality of coaching across the English system through its\u00a0 Elite Coaching Plan .\u00a0\u00a0 \n As part of this, we are showcasing in a series of articles, how the Premier League is leading a positive change in the global perception of our coaching at academy and first-team levels, as well as increasing the diversity of the coaching workforce.\u00a0 \n Adrian Clarke spoke earlier this year to  Leeds United  first-team coach Mark Jackson who kindly set time aside to speak less than 48 hours after they dramatically secured their Premier League status with a  2-1 victory at Brentford  on the final day. \n Mark Jackson (LEE) \n \u201cFrom the moment  Jesse Marsch  was brought into the club, so much changed so quickly for everyone,\" Jackson says. \n \u201cComing away from  Marcelo Bielsa \u2019s unique system of play built around man-marking, at a time when we were fighting a relegation battle, required a huge amount of adaptation from the players and staff. \n \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a lot of time. There was a need to hit the ground running. \n \"And the way Jesse works on the training ground, was also completely different to how it had been, but together we worked really, really, hard to help the players understand this major transition as quickly as possible. \n \u201cThere was pressure, and it was challenging, but thankfully the hard work paid off.\u201d \n The 44-year-old is a former academy graduate, with 19 first-team appearances for Leeds. Born in the city, and a boyhood fan to boot, he was thrilled to return to Elland Road six-and-a-half years ago in a coaching capacity. \n Initially brought in by Paul Hart to work with the Under-15s, he has since coached the Under-16s, Under-18s and more recently Leeds\u2019 Premier League 2 side. \n First-team promotion \n This upward trajectory went to the next level in March, when Marsch joined from RB Leipzig to replace Bielsa. \n Keen to draw on Jackson\u2019s knowledge of the club and their young players, the American promoted him to become part of his first-team coaching staff alongside Franz Schiemer and Cameron Toshack. \n \u201cI was grateful for the opportunity to help and support them during that really important transition period,\u201d Jackson added. \n \u201cMoving from a head coach position with the Under-23s does mean I am in more of a supporting role now, but I comfortable with that. I feel I am ready to work with senior players and this is a great opportunity that I am enjoying. \n \u201cThe way training looks has totally changed. \u201cMarcelo wanted to coach with drill practices a lot of the time, whereas Jesse is more traditional and aligned with the way I was brought up as a coach. \n \n \n \"I love Leeds United, and it\u2019s a club with massive potential. All I can say is that I am very happy working with Jesse, playing a style of football that I like\" \n \n Mark Jackson \n \n \n \n \u201cHis sessions are not too far removed from what I experienced in my own playing career. \n \u201cEverything is more game-based, with possession practices replacing drill-based work, for example. This has helped me really because it\u2019s what I was attuned to before and it is how I see football being coached.\u201d \n Session planning \n During Bielsa\u2019s four-year spell in charge, the Argentinian liked the Under-23 group to join first-team training. \n While this gave the youngsters a fantastic opportunity to catch the manager\u2019s eye, it did leave Jackson, who assisted those sessions, short on time to make specific tactical preparations for Premier League 2 matches. \n One key difference since the regime changed hands is an increase in joined-up thinking between members of the coaching staff, reveals Jackson. \n \u201cSession planning was extremely challenging under the previous manager, as decisions were often made at the last minute. \n \"I might not know what we were going to focus on before we went out to train, and sometimes we\u2019d be 10 minutes into the warm-up, and I still couldn\u2019t be sure what the session was going to entail. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Marsch has had a huge effect at the club, both in terms of results on the pitch and his support to the coaches on the training pitch\n             \n \n \u201cNow, we sit down the day before as a team of coaches - in a meeting that Jesse will lead - and together we discuss what we want to achieve from that next session. \n \u201cMy role on the grass is flexible from day to day. At times I might break off with one of the other coaches to work on an element of our play from a defensive point of view. \n \u201cIt might be that myself or Cameron [Toshack] take the scout team for an 11v11 against the starting XI. There it will be my responsibility to replicate how our next opposition play and assign roles to the players in that scout team. \n \u201cThe great thing for me is that we have this planning process now. And in that process, Jesse doesn\u2019t dictate to us. \n \u201cHe will ask for opinions on what we should be doing, and how we do it. It\u2019s been such a valuable experience so far, and I feel it\u2019s a great quality for a manager to have that sense of inclusivity.\u201d \n Experiences to treasure\u00a0 \n During a pulsating run-in, Leeds were involved in several dramatic matches where they grabbed valuable late goals. \n They scored stoppage-time winners against  Norwich City ,  Wolverhampton Wanderers  and Brentford and  Pascal Struijk \u2019s last-minute equaliser in their  penultimate match at home to Brighton & Hove Albion , was also priceless. \n Being part of those astonishing twists and turns provided Jackson with experiences he will treasure. \n \u201cI see Leeds United as my club, it is where I grew up, so to be part of those moments, so close to it, was really special. \n \u201cAfter the euphoria and jubilation of  Joe Gelhardt \u2019s winner against Norwich, I remember saying to Jesse in the dressing-room that, believe it or not, this is quite normal for Leeds, and funnily enough that\u2019s how it panned out in the closing weeks. \n Matchday preparations \n \u201cJesse always makes the final decisions, but throughout a game, he will turn around and ask for opinions. If I have an idea or a view on something tactical, or a possible change, he is the kind of manager that welcomes you bringing that forward. \n \n \n \"\u201cOur use of video clips at half-time is something that I hadn\u2019t seen before, and I have to say it can be an incredibly effective tool\" \n \n Mark Jackson \n \n \n \n \"Frank [Schiemer] is in constant dialogue with the analysts about which clips we want to show, and he will nip off a few minutes early to get them ready for the interval. \n \"And while the players are settling down, Jesse and the rest of us will review the clips before he presents them. \n \u201cIn the past managers have told players they think they can do this or that better, but the players had to take their word for it. \n \"Now, we can actually show players on a screen what they are doing well, areas to improve, and how we can exploit the opposition. It is really, really beneficial.\u201d \n Appreciation for Bielsa \n The sudden departure of Bielsa stunned Leeds fans, who continue to revere the 60-year-old for the quality of football his sides delivered. \n Jackson is keen to point out how much he also values the experience of working alongside a manager with such a distinctive outlook. \n \u201cMarcelo and the rest of his staff were great with me when I was the Under-23s head coach. They shared their ideas and were always open to answering any questions I had. \n \u201cIt was a unique style of football, so I had to spend a lot of time observing them, analysing their drills, and being around the group. \n \"I had to learn exactly what was required for me to transmit that philosophy to the Under-23s. It was an education.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One of the primary quirks of Bielsa\u2019s ideas is based around choosing a formation dictated to by how the opposition line up. \n If, for example, an opponent play with one striker, it would usually mean a back four for Leeds. This would revert to a three-man defence when facing two strikers. \n \u201cAlongside our excellent analysts we had to do a lot of scouting beforehand, studying how other Under-23 teams set up. That research was thorough and a real team effort\u201d explains Jackson. \n \u201cAs soon as the team sheet came in we\u2019d have a good idea of the formation we\u2019d be up against, so then we would adjust our own shape accordingly. \n \u201cTo operate in this way the players knew we had to have two or three systems in mind, ready to go. \n \u201cI had to coach my players so that they could easily deal with adaptability. This meant setting them up with a variety of ideas so that when an opponent altered their shape, we were able to react quickly within the game. \n \u201cIt was something we got to grips with and looking back we were fairly successful with it, too. \n \u201cThe funny thing is I am convinced certain managers I came up against tried to deliberately disrupt us, by throwing in a new formation unexpectedly,\u201d he adds with a smile. \n \u201cWe were used to it, but the main challenge for me was knowing whether to drop a defensive midfielder into the back three, or sliding one of the full-backs inside. Or flipping that around the other way. \n \u201cThis was a challenging way to manage because we also had to make a lot of enforced substitutions in order to adjust. \n \"That said, the experience taught me to take certain considerations into every match you play and to investigate each eventuality beforehand so that you are ready to react.\u201d \n Valuable experiences \n At the back end of a playing career where the former defender represented Scunthorpe United, Kidderminster Harriers and Rochdale, Jackson went through his coaching badges as a semi-pro with non-league Farsley. \n \n \n \"I have coached at every level, among all the age groups, with differing abilities and I firmly believe that has helped me massively in my own career\" \n \n Mark Jackson \n \n \n \n He worked as head of football at Leeds City College, coached at Bradford City for a short period, while also working in local primary schools, before Leeds came knocking. \n According to Jackson, each of those early roles were tremendously valuable to his learning. \n \u201cSomeone asked me a while back for advice on how to succeed in coaching and my best advice was to give yourself a vast array of experiences,\u201d he says. \n \u201cI have coached at every level, among all the age groups, with differing abilities and I firmly believe that has helped me massively in my own career. \n \u201cThe one constant that you need to have, no matter which level you are coaching at is adaptability in my opinion. Being able to adjust to any given situation or circumstance helps you deal with problems when they present themselves. \n \u201cIf you can think on your feet and put something in place to fix a situation quickly, that is half the battle. \n \u201cThe other piece of advice I would always pass on is, to connect with your players. \n \u201cI remember being on a course once where all the coaches were discussing their philosophies, systems, tactics etc, but I look at it a different way. \n \u201cI told them my philosophy is based around connecting with players. If you can\u2019t get them on board or understand how to treat every individual, it can be an uphill battle. Building a rapport is vital.\u201d \n Future ambitions \n Looking into the future, Jackson harbours ambitions to manage at first-team level and to help facilitate that, he is hoping to enrol on a UEFA Pro License course as quickly as possible. \n In the short term though, he is hoping that Marsch decides to make him part of the first-team set-up for next season and beyond. \n \u201cSince I came back to Elland Road the club have been so supportive to me and given me so many great opportunities to develop as a coach. The progression has felt natural until this point and I am hoping that continues. \n \u201cThe way I look at my own career is to simply hone my skills every day, because you never stop learning. \n \u201cI love Leeds United, and it\u2019s a club with massive potential. All I can say is that I am very happy working with Jesse, playing a style of football that I like. \n \u201cIf I can play a part in helping even more young players make it into the Leeds United first team, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Betsy: Focus on being the best coach you can Part 2:  Why Arsenal lead the way for counter-attacking goals Part 3:  Hobbs: Support for coaches is incredibly important Part 4:  Binnion: League helps take me out of my comfort zone as a coach \n",

    "summary": "Adrian Clarke speaks with Man Utd's Under-18 coach on how he prepares young players for life as professionals",
    "text": "\n The Premier League has a vision to develop a world-leading coaching development system by elevating the quality of coaching across the English system through its  Elite Coaching Plan .\u00a0\u00a0 \n As part of this, we are showcasing in a series of articles, how the Premier League is leading a positive change in the global perception of our coaching at academy and first-team levels, as well as increasing the diversity of the coaching workforce.\u00a0 \n One way the Premier League is leading the change is through its  Elite Heads of Coaching  (EHOC) programme, which seeks to empower all Premier League and EFL clubs to establish a sustainable approach to coach development in academy football. \n Earlier this year, Adrian Clarke spoke to Travis Binnion,  Manchester United \u2019s Under-18 lead coach, a role he also combines with being Head of Player Development & Coaching, who is currently on the Premier League\u2019s  Elite Coach Accreditation Scheme (ECAS) . \n Travis Binnion (MUN) \n \"The most challenging part of my job is getting players to just worry about themselves and their progress. \n \"Are you better than yesterday? Are you better than you were six weeks ago? If you are that's great, what's happened? If not, why not? Let's work on it. \n \"There is so much going on in a teenager's life and so many voices they can listen to - and we must not to let it interfere with their development. \n 'We need joined-up thinking' \n \"If we as coaches think we are the biggest and sole influences then we are kidding ourselves. So, to get these young players to be the best they can be, we need joined-up thinking and for all the various stakeholders to be on the same page. \n \"That means getting parents, friends, agents etc to buy in and understand the role they can play, to help that person achieve their potential. \n \"This is an environment and culture thing, and it's something we are working hard to create.\" \n Straight-talking and incredibly passionate about improving the gifted young players in his care, Binnion speaks with clarity and is driven to make a difference. \n Starting out \n After a hip injury ended his own dreams of becoming a first-team player at boyhood club Sheffield United, Binnion embarked on a coaching career within the Blades Academy at the age of 21. \n Taken under his wing by John Pemberton, he was assistant manager of a Sheff Utd Under-18s side featuring  Harry Maguire  that reached the 2011 FA Youth Cup Final. \n When Nick Cox left as Academy manager at Bramall Lane five years later to join Man Utd, Binnion was handed the reins, aged just 31. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"I learned a lot about communicating with people and trying to inspire as Academy manager at Sheffield United,\" he says. \"I picked up a lot of new skills doing that job which was fantastic, but it did dilute my time on the grass working with players. \n \"I did alright but trying to run and develop the academy, manage all the staff and work on the organisational side, all while still coaching the Under-23s, wasn't easy at the time.\" \n In 2019, Cox brought Binnion across to Man Utd to oversee the U14-U16 player development phase. Last summer, after a reshuffle at Carrington, he became lead coach of the Under-18s. \n Could that dual role be beneficial to the players? Binnion thinks so. \"Nick Cox's vision is working really well,\" he says. \n \"In academies I feel like there can be a lot of issues that crop up across phase lines - and that's the opposite of what is meant to be achieved. \n \n \n \"This is an environment and culture thing, and it\u2019s something we are working hard to create\" \n \n Travis Binnion \n \n \n \n \"From foundations into 14s, 16s, into the youth team, even youth team to the 23s, you've got different people with differing opinions, a player's development can be stifled or accelerated. That's not always in the player's favour.\" \n \"Alignment is a word that is used a lot, but it is so key. The way we work at United reduces issues that can arise when there is a lack of continuity. \n \"Here I like to get our 14s, 15s and 16s coaches involved in some youth-team sessions and senior staff from the older age groups like Mark Dempsey and Paul McShane will get involved with the younger guys too. \n \"We have got a real swirl going on and it gives me the ability to make sure the programme is right for the players, that we are giving them the right experiences, and crucially, that we are all making the right decisions. \n \"We have the benefit of knowing what comes next for them, and that's the beauty of it.\" \n All-round preparation\u00a0 \n Preparing teenage footballers for the rigours of life in the professional game is very much at the forefront of Binnion's thinking. \n The technical, tactical, and athletic aspects of their development are naturally of paramount importance, but so too is their mindset. \n \"They grow up in a bubble, training and playing through the age groups, but down the line it is the best game in the world, that is also a ruthless industry,\" he says. \n \"They have got to know what is going to be required of them and you can't just shock them at the point when it happens. You need to build them up to it. \n \"That means the work ethic in training, the standards of behaviour around the building have to be right. \n \"It's important young players don't think they can just do their bit on the football pitch and then do what they want in the gym, in school or wherever else they are. \n \"You are trying to build a robust individual who's aware of their surroundings, who thrives as a person on and off the pitch. \n \"My view is players should only fail if they are not good enough, not because they weren't able to adjust. \n \"If we get that side of it right, with the quality of players we have at Man Utd, then we will succeed as an academy, and most importantly the kids will also go on and achieve.\" \n Elite Coach Apprenticeship Scheme \n In 2021, Binnion was offered a place on the Premier League's Elite Coach Apprenticeship Scheme (ECAS). \n It is a two-year development programme aimed at accelerating the learning of coaches employed by clubs, who demonstrate the potential to be future elite coaches in youth football. \n Encouraged by Man Utd to enrol in the scheme, the experience is proving beneficial to Binnion. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"I feel like I have been on a hamster wheel for 14 or 15 years. It's worked for me, and I just love coaching players and helping them. \n \"That's what gets me excited, but sometimes you need to step out of your day-to-day working environment to develop other skillsets. \n \"Even just taking the time to reflect on what you are, or what you aren't is invaluable.\" \n Along with other selected coaches from around the country, he recently spent two days at Birmingham University learning communication and relationship-building skills, that included a talk from hostage situation specialists. \n There was also an ad-lib session at a comedy club, designed to help the coaches work on reacting to impromptu situations, particularly on the media side. \n \"I want to upskill and stretch myself, and ECAS does that.

    "text": "\n The Premier League has a vision to develop a world-leading coaching development system by elevating the quality of coaching across the English system through its  Elite Coaching Plan .\u00a0\u00a0 \n As part of this, we are showcasing in a series of articles, how the Premier League is leading a positive change in the global perception of our coaching at academy and first-team levels, as well as increasing the diversity of the coaching workforce.\u00a0 \n One way the Premier League is leading the change is through its  Elite Heads of Coaching  (EHOC) programme, which seeks to empower all Premier League and EFL clubs to establish a sustainable approach to coach development in academy football. \n Earlier this year, Adrian Clarke spoke to Luke Hobbs, the head of academy coaching at  Arsenal , who is a member of EHOC to hear about his role and how the Premier League helps him. \n Luke Hobbs (Arsenal) \n Player development will always be the No 1 priority at academy level, but to facilitate this, standards of coaching must never be allowed to stand still.\u00a0So, who is it that coaches the coaches?\u00a0 \n At Arsenal, that responsibility belongs to Hobbs, who oversees the Under-9s right up to the Under-23s, across their hugely successful sites at Hale End and London Colney. \n \"We need to help the coaches in order to help the players,\" says Hobbs as he passionately explains the value of being on hand to give them regular support. \n \"The volume of staff around the players is so big. There's operations, sports science and medicine, player care, analysis, education, talent ID, nutrition, and psychology \u2013 and the head coach at each age group manages all of those members of staff, as well as the players and their parents. \n \"The support that each coach needs, to be a good coach, to be a good people manager and to look after everything else is incredibly important. That's why we are there.\" \n Beneficial feedback \n As part of his remit, Hobbs rotates his time working with different age-group coaches. They will often be mic-ed up and filmed in training, as well as on certain matchdays. \n \"All the head coaches get match day and session feedback throughout the season,\" he adds.\u00a0\"From my end it's usually a lot of what went well when we sit down with them. It can be so beneficial for a coach to take a step back, reflect, and watch how they get their messages across to the players. \n \"At Arsenal we also focus heavily on our playing style and trying to be aligned from Under-9s to Under-23s,\" continues Hobbs, who has worked within their Academy since 2013. \n \n \n \"The support that each coach needs, to be a good coach, to be a good people manager and to look after everything else is incredibly important. That\u2019s why we are there.\" \n \n Luke Hobbs \n \n \n \n \"For example, we will look at what 'starting to create an attack' looks like at Under-9s. What it's like at Under-12s and so on. \n \"And I'll ask myself, 'How do we train it?' 'What does it look like in a game?' 'Which principles stay the same, or alter as the boys get older?' \n \"If my eye tells me that in our playing style I am seeing similar things throughout the Academy, that is in line with our playing identity, to me is a gauge of success. I'm not overly obsessed with results.\" \n To help retain that similar way of thinking, his Under-18s head coach, Under-23s and Loans Coach and Under-23s head coach all regularly go to Hale End to share ideas and knowledge with their fellow coaches. \n Staff there also pay frequent visits to London Colney, to learn from what is going on.\u00a0This helps us to create one coaching team over two training grounds. \n Last summer, Mark Rivers, who had previously spent 10 years working at the FA, joined him in a role in which he manages Pre-Academy Coaching from the Under-5s to Under-8s.\u00a0 \n Rivers\u00a0is also on the Premier League's Future Coach Developer Pilot Programme with several other high-potential coach developers from across the game. \u00a0 \n Core values \n Inspired by Arsenal Academy boss and former club captain  Per Mertesacker , the club's vision is to be the most caring and challenging football academy in the world. \n The aim is to produce \"strong young Gunners\" with three core values at the heart of what they do: discipline, humility and respect. \n \"In the age groups I cover I am big on those values,\" says Rivers. \"If we are preaching these messages to the coaches, to the players, to the parents and making sure they adhere to them, we have got to do the same. \n \"Part of my job is to make sure that by respectfully challenging the coaches. We too are living out these values. \n \"If we don't, they just become lovely phrases that go on mouse mats and mugs!\" \n Personal connection \n Rivers is also keen to point out that his role is not just to assess the work of the coaches, but to have a constant, open and friendly dialogue with them. \n \"We talk about having a coaching workforce full of radiators rather than hoovers,\" he adds. \n \"Radiators warm the place up. As soon as we get into that dome at Hale End it's all smiles and fist bumps. I think having that connector with a coach is key. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                At Arsenal, Mark Rivers wants a decision-rich environment where the coaches are able to make decisions for themselves\n             \n \n \"I hear you had this going on in your life, do you want to talk about it? How was your coaching course the other day? Do you want to share ideas? \n \"I'll ask about the session they did last week and see if they've had time to reflect. We don't want it to become a churn of session, session, game, session, session, game, without getting to know about each other as people too.\" \n As part of the EHOC programme, both men are given access to highly experienced mentors, and through courses put on by the Premier League, they are taught how to mentor too. \n Great value is also placed on soaking up knowledge from outside sources. \n Learning from others \n Hobbs, 42, may have worked at Arsenal's Academy alongside Liam Brady, Andries Jonker and now Mertesacker - as well having a spell in interim charge himself - but it his view that gaining expertise from elsewhere is of paramount importance. \n \"At a big club like this you can sometimes become a little bit insular, but it's indispensable to get advice and learn from what's going on outside the football club. \n \"This season we\u2019ve had  Rio Ferdinand  speak to all our coaches for an hour, and we've also had [former West Ham academy director] Tony Carr come in and chat to us too. \n \"External speakers from a range of different backgrounds are invited in to add value, and very soon  David Seaman  is joining us to tell us what he learnt from all the brilliant managers he played under which should be fantastic.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Per Mertesacker wants Arsenal to be the most caring and challenging football academy in the world\n             \n \n \"We actively want to look and learn from others. EHOC asked us to go to Fulham recently and we both [Hobbs and Rivers] wanted to be there and it was beneficial.\u00a0 \n \"We speak about wanting our players to be lifelong learners, but we also want our coaches to be lifelong learners too. That's how the club moves forward.\" \n Making progress \n Inside Arsenal's Academy, there is a holistic approach to making progress, individually and collectively within the coaching ranks. \n Sharing honest and constructive dialogue is regarded as essential, and on that topic Rivers is keen to share a story that struck a chord with him earlier on this season after he'd role-modelled part of a session. \n \"I have a coach who sends me voice notes after every training session and one of the most striking ones was where he asked me what I meant by 'setting traps'. \n \"He said he felt quite embarrassed that he didn't know the term when I had delivered it, but I told him I was the one who should be embarrassed because I'd assumed he was aware of it. \n \"There's a subconscious barrier to learning that coaches sometimes fall into, and we don't want that to be the case here. It was a valuable period of open reflection that was very useful for both of us. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Hobbs says looking and learning from others is extremely important\n             \n \n \"Hopefully, at Arsenal we have created a decision-rich environment where the coaches are able to make decisions for themselves,\" continues Rivers, who has also worked for Plymouth Argyle, Reading, Wycombe Wanderers, AFC Wimbledon and Farnborough Town. \n \"There are some non-negotiables in terms of our playing philosophy and core values of course, but with that there has to be room for autonomy, and for you to freely express yourself as a practitioner.\" \n To achieve Mertesacker's blueprint for developing \"Strong Young Gunners\", the Academy sets out four pillars that underpin their coaching. \n Everything they work towards is aimed at developing an \"Effective Team Player\", a \"Lifelong Learner\", someone with \"Champion Mentality\", who is also a \"Most Efficient Mover\". \n Their playing identity is aiming for each individual to master the ball so that all teams can dominate possession. \n From Under-9s to Under-23s, every age group has three coaches. It is felt that a small coach-to-player ratio is really important to develop every player as every player matters. \n They all have very clear roles and responsibilities. The head coach is responsible for team tactics and playing style. One assistant coach is responsible for individual techniques and football coordination. The other assistant coach is responsible for game insight and decision making. \n \n \n \"We speak about wanting our players to be lifelong learners, but we also want our coaches to be lifelong learners too\" \n \n Luke Hobbs, head of academy coaching at Arsenal \n \n \n \n Improving players is the name of the game, but as the conversation develops, it is abundantly clear that there is also a strong will for every coach within Arsenal's Academy to raise their own levels year on year too. \n Hobbs puts together regular development action plans for all their head coaches, and everyone at Hale End is actively encouraged to upskill through courses and workshops run by the FA. \n Finding balance\u00a0 \n Monthly playing style CPD meetings (Continued Professional Development) take place to ensure there is a clear line on how they want their teams to play, and Hobbs will also meet phase leads at least once a month for progress reports. \n \"In football you talk about individuals-units-team and on the coaching side we do the same,\" he says. \n \"In this role I will spend time working with an individual coach, with a cluster unit of coaches within a phase, and then I'll sit down with our team of coaches as a whole. \n \"Putting together a successful coaching team is very similar to picking a starting eleven as a head coach. I have to select a team where I put the best people in the right positions at the right time. You constantly assess and review that.\" \n Creating pathways is also key to a happy working environment according to Hobbs, who previously worked in youth development at Southend United, Cambridge United and Peterborough United during a coaching career that now spans 24 years. \n \"We are really proud of the number of coaches who have worked at pre-academy level that have now taken opportunities to work at Hale End, and a number have gone from part-time to full-time positions. \n \"We\u2019ve seen coaches go from working at Hale End to London Colney, and then gone from working at the academy to joining the FA in important roles. We absolutely celebrate all of that. \n \"We can't govern anyone's direction or journey. We will sit with an individual coach at the start of the year and ask them what they want to be, where they want to go, and once we establish that we can try and help them. \n \"Balancing what the coaches want, with what the players need is really important \u2013 but we do want our coaches to see that there is a pathway. \n \"If our coaches are content and believe they are developing with us, then hopefully this will rub off on the players, and they will be happy as well.\" \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 Academy coaches broaden horizons with comedy Part 3:  Hobbs: Support for coaches is incredibly important Part 4:  Binnion: League helps take me out of my comfort zone as a coach Part 5:\u00a0 Building connection with players is key to coaching \n",

    "text": "\n Adrian Clarke analyses players who have changed clubs this summer and can make an impact in 2022/23. \n Ivan Perisic (TOT) \n Antonio Conte did not settle on a first-choice left wing-back for  Tottenham Hotspur  last season, switching between  Sergio Reguilon ,  Ryan Sessegnon  and  Matt Doherty . \n \n \n \n \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 1 \n \n SOU \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n All three did well in spells, but none of them cemented a position which is likely to be occupied by summer arrival Perisic in 2022/23. \n The 33-year-old Croatia international worked with  Conte  at Inter Milan and, on the back of an impressive Serie A campaign, he should be an excellent fit down that wing. \n Big-match player \n In recent years, Perisic has proved himself to be a consistent performer who regularly raises his game for the big occasions. \n He has scored 14 goals for Croatia at major tournaments, including one in the 2018 FIFA World Cup final. \n He was also superb at the business end of Inter\u2019s 2021/22 Serie A campaign. \n He scored three goals and provided six assists in their last 10 league matches, while in the Coppa Italia final he netted\u00a0twice in extra-time to secure a victory over Juventus. \n Loves to cross \n Conte\u2019s teams always use the full width of the pitch, so Perisic will be viewed as a key addition. \n Conte's Spurs team delivered the second-highest number of successful crosses from open play last season, behind only  Liverpool , and Perisic\u2019s arrival will significantly strengthen their quality in this area. \n Despite making only six starts in last season\u2019s UEFA Champions League (UCL), it was Perisic who produced the most crosses from open play in the competition. \n Most open-play crosses in UCL \n \n \n \n 2021/22 \n Starts \n Crosses \n \n \n \n \n Ivan Perisic \n 6 \n 40 \n \n \n Trent Alexander-Arnold \n 9 \n 38 \n \n \n Dusan Tadic \n 7 \n 38 \n \n \n Kingsley Coman \n 8 \n 36 \n \n \n Riyad Mahrez \n 11 \n 29 \n \n \n \n Spurs fans can expect Perisic to speed down the left side before delivering dangerous crosses for  Harry Kane  to attack. \n Seven of his nine assists in all competitions last term came from crosses whipped in from that side. \n While he can produce quality from deeper areas, his trademark delivery is standing the ball up for team-mates who are arriving at the far post. \n These balls are hard to stop because Perisic is two-footed and can produce quality on his right or left side.\u00a0 \n Set-piece threat \n Spurs only scored eight goals from set-plays last season, with only Norwich City, Watford and  Manchester United  netting fewer. \n The arrival of Perisic increases their goal threat enormously. \n He usually occupies a position inside the box, attacking the cross. \n Four of his 10 goals for Inter last season came from corners, with three of them being brilliant near-post headers. \n Still going strong \n He may be approaching his mid-thirties, but Perisic still has a strong enough engine to perform a demanding role as a wing-back. \n He started 35 out of 38 league matches last season and still has the pace to beat full-backs on the outside. \n Perisic's UCL stats 2021/22 \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n Perisic \n Inter rank \n \n \n \n \n Starts \n 6 \n 7th \n \n \n Open-play crosses \n 40 \n 1st \n \n \n Dribbles completed \n 6 \n 1st \n \n \n Chances created \n 14 \n 2nd \n \n \n Shots \n 11 \n 3rd \n \n \n Touches in opp. box \n 33 \n 3rd \n \n \n \n His defending is adequate but not a core strength, meaning it is his attacking qualities that have attracted Spurs\u2019 attention. \n Domestically and in Europe, Perisic was among Inter\u2019s most prominent attacking players in 2021/22. \n He will regularly get into the final third and, once there, he has the talent to hurt opponents with a crisp strike or accurate final ball. \n This is a short-term fix for Spurs that should instantly improve their starting XI. \n See:   Talking Tactics: New signings for 2022/23 \n",

This was where they were at their best last term, springing fast breaks to hurt the opposition. \n Johnson, who excelled on loan for Lincoln City in 2020/21 in League One, is integral to that approach. \n Thanks to his speed and mobility, he produced the second-most shots from fast breaks last season. \n Johnson's attacking stats 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Championship \n Johnson \n League rank \n \n \n \n \n Big chance conversion* \n 75% \n 1st \n \n \n Shots from fast breaks \n 11 \n 2nd \n \n \n Shots from inside box \n 77 \n 5th \n \n \n Chances created from open play \n 61 \n 5th \n \n \n \n * Minimum 10 big chances \n Johnson was at his most impressive in key matches. \n He scored in both legs of the Championship playoff semi-final against Sheffield United and starred in memorable FA Cup victories over  Arsenal  and  Leicester City , netting against the Foxes. \n Statistically, Johnson boasted the highest conversion rate from big chances in the second tier, scoring with 75 per cent of those opportunities. \n He also offers terrific creativity, regularly showcasing his skill down the flanks to set up team-mates. \n In open play, just four Championship players created more chances than he did last term. \n Premier League defenders will not just be wary of Johnson\u2019s speed but also the direct way in which he brings the ball forward. \n Average ball carry comparison \n \n \n \n Player \n Ave. ball carry distance \n Ave. ball carry progress \n \n \n \n \n Johnson (NFO) \n 14.8m \n 10.5m \n \n \n Bowler (QPR) \n 14.1m \n 10.4m \n \n \n Kebano (FUL)\u00a0 \n 12.0m \n 7.4m \n \n \n \n Last season he carried the ball 14.8 metres on average and made more progress than any other Championship player (10.5m on average). \n Five of his carries resulted in assists and three ended with him scoring. \n Ryan Yates \n The most-improved player since Cooper took charge is Yates, a homegrown central midfielder who has developed into an all-action star. \n The 24-year-old gets around the pitch superbly to break up play and is excellent at dropping into his own area to clear danger. \n However, it is his unexpected goalscoring prowess last term that elevated his status. \n Scoring eight times in his last 36 Championship appearances, compared with six in his previous 84, Yates delivered end product at crucial moments throughout Forest's promotion campaign. \n He is very good at making late runs into the opposition box. From one such burst, he helped to force Levi Colwill\u2019s own-goal winner against Huddersfield Town in the Championship playoff final. \n \n \n The winning goal at Wembley. \u26bd\ufe0f \ud83c\udf33\ud83d\udd34  #NFFC   pic.twitter.com/7hIqUGhtvM \n\u2014 Nottingham Forest FC (@NFFC)  May 31, 2022 \n \n Yates also boasts a real threat from corners and wide free-kicks. \n No Championship player registered more goals from set-pieces in 2021/22, with seven of his eight strikes coming from dead-balls. \n In a season where set-plays are likely to be of huge significance for Forest, Yates is very much their danger man. \n Championship set-piece goals 21/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Set-piece goals (exc. pens) \n \n \n \n \n Yates (NFO) \n 7 \n \n \n Mitrovic (FUL) \n 6 \n \n \n Crooks (MID) \n 5 \n \n \n Solanke (BOU) \n 5 \n \n \n Ekpiteta (BLP) \n 5 \n \n \n \n Despite operating in a box-to-box role, Yates is Forest's most defensive-minded midfielder. \n He will help out his three central defenders when crosses come into the box, often covering for a centre-back who has been dragged towards the wings. \n For this reason, and his strength when defending set-pieces, Yates' 91 clearances were far more than anyone else who played in central midfield for the majority of last season. \n He also makes a string of interceptions and wins more than his fair share of tackles and headers. \n Top stats for midfielders 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Aerial duels won \n Player \n Clearances \n \n \n \n \n Crooks (MID) \n 146 \n Yates \n 91 \n \n \n Yates (NFO) \n 108 \n Gardner \n 65 \n \n \n Gardner (BIR) \n 100 \n Smallwood (HUL)\u00a0 \n 60 \n \n \n \n Yates has offered plenty for Forest in every area, on and off the ball, during a brilliant promotion campaign. \n Forest supporters will now be hoping he can take that form into the Premier League. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Fulham back with exciting attack Part 2:  Wilson to deliver for Fulham again Part 3:  Parker has the tools to succeed Part 4:  Kelly and Billing key for Cherries Part 5:  Forest counters can cause problems \n",

loaned from Watford - was at his best in a free No 10 role. \n It will be interesting to see who will play these roles in the Premier League.\u00a0 \n New role for Johnson \n Cooper has also been keen to start his most dangerous attacker,  Brennan Johnson , in a striker\u2019s role where he can run in behind the last man. \n Having previously operated as a winger, and unaccustomed to playing up front, the Welshman has worked best alongside a natural centre-forward. \n Johnson goal v Sheff Utd \n \n \n 1\ufe0f\u20e38\ufe0f\u20e3 goals this season for  #OneOfOurOwn  \ud83c\udff9  \ud83c\udf33\ud83d\udd34  #NFFC   pic.twitter.com/DWJDB19OU3 \n\u2014 Nottingham Forest FC (@NFFC)  May 14, 2022 \n \n It would be a surprise to see Forest deviate away from 3-4-1-2 in the early stages of 2022/23, but much will depend on who they recruit this summer. \n If they are unable to keep hold of loanees  James Garner  and  Keinan Davis  as well as Spence and Zinckernagel, Cooper is likely to target players of a similar style to maintain this shape. \n Top attacking\u00a0Championship teams 21/22 \n \n \n \n Team \n Direct attacks \n Fast breaks \n Shots from fast breaks \n \n \n \n \n NFO \n 97 \n 33 \n 28 \n \n \n COV \n 97 \n 30 \n 25 \n \n \n BLB \n -

    "text": "\n As part of the Premier League  celebrating five years of Premier League Primary Stars , clubs running the school programme have nominated a \"Superstar\" - a young person or teacher who has inspired others through their dedication to the scheme, enthusiasm and own personal development. \n Stephanie (Charlton Athletic) \n Returning to work after maternity leave is a daunting prospect for many women, including Stephanie Baker, a primary school teacher and a mother of two. \n The anxieties about self-worth, staff changes, possible new responsibilities and duties are among issues that can be a real concern for teachers returning from a long absence. \n Steph's smooth transition back to her role as PE Lead at Alderwood Primary School in Eltham, southeast London, was helped by Premier League Primary Stars and  Charlton Athletic Community Trust 's (CACT) Premier League Programme Officer, Anthony Quarm. \n \"I had just come back from maternity leave, and for anyone who has worked from home with two children for seven years, your confidence level is not brilliant,\" says Steph.\u00a0\"Anthony provided me with that level of confidence.\" \n Exceptional progress \n Any worries Steph had were swiftly eased by her exceptional personal progress and as well as delivering PE she is a part of CACT's project to create a PE working group to support other teachers. \n Anthony has seen Steph's confidence develop and the positive impact that has had on her students. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"I'm very proud of the work Steph is doing,\" says Anthony, \"It's brilliant to see how the children are responding - laughing and also taking part. \n \"We offer our support to teachers. A lot of the impact we do, we hope will build a lifelong love of PE and sport for young kids. \n \"In areas of high deprivation where young people may not have such access to certain activities, we are able to provide that. The impact we have seen through this programme is absolutely extensive.\" \n Making a difference \n Steph's outstanding work via Premier League Primary Stars and CACT has been recognised with her Superstar award, an honour which has made her even more determined to continue making a difference. \n \"To be named as Premier League Superstar is a very humbling experience,\" she says.\u00a0\"It's lovely to be recognised and will keep me driving our enthusiasm at the school and to keep those links going with the Premier League.\" \n \"[PL Primary Stars] knocks down all kinds of boundaries. There is the capacity for huge issues within our society to be changed. We are pushing against racism, we are pushing for gender equality. \n \"If we bring sport into the conversations we have within school, through sport so much can be changed.\" \n About PL Primary Stars \n CACT have been engaging with Premier League Primary Stars since the very start of the programme, while Charlton are one of 105 professional football clubs from across the leagues working in partnership with the Premier League. \n PL Primary Stars provides teachers and parents with free downloadable resources across a range of curriculum subjects at Key Stage 1 (ages 5-7 years) and Key Stage 2 (ages 7-11 years). \n \"The funding that is provided by the Premier League is absolutely crucial,\" adds Katie Cutajar, Headteacher, Alderwood Primary School. \n \"It really will have a lifelong impact and change for our children.\"\u00a0 \n The resources, which are free, have been developed for teachers by teachers, and in collaboration with experts such as the\u00a0 National Literacy Trust \u00a0and the\u00a0 PSHE Association . \n Visit\u00a0 PLPrimaryStars.com \u00a0 for more information. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 Premier League celebrates five years of PL Primary Stars Part 2:\u00a0 William's story (Leicester City) Part 3:\u00a0 Harry's story (Forest Green Rovers) Part 5:  Faizan's story (Burnley) Part 6:  Godolphin Academy's story Part 7:  Freya's story (Newport County) Part 8:  Delia's story (Everton) \n",

It has made a huge difference to all the football players. When we just disagree, we go straight into 'Rock, Paper, Scissors.' \" \n \n \n \"Primary Stars has really helped me to go forward on to the next steps and try to achieve more things\" \n \n PL Primary Stars participant Harry \n \n \n \n Harry's desire to reduce conflict is symptomatic of his development since he became involved with Premier League Primary Stars. \n \"He's gained lots of confidence in his ability to work together with other children - adults as well,\" says Caroline Musty, headteacher at Rodmarton. \n Harry has also made progress in the classroom, making a \"phenomenal\" improvement with his reading, according to Mant. \n And through the school's Ambassador Programme, opportunities have opened up with Forest Green, last season's EFL League Two champions. \n \n \n Launched in 2017 and available to every primary school in England and Wales,  #PLPrimaryStars  uses the appeal of the  #PL  and professional football clubs to support pupils in the classroom, the playground and on the sports field \ud83d\ude4c Why we're celebrating \u27a1\ufe0f  https://t.co/xeiPawQBvI   pic.twitter.com/8qOzmKcsN0 \n\u2014 Premier League Communities (@PLCommunities)  June 20, 2022 \n \n Harry has volunteered to read the teamsheet out to the crowd before kick-off, and has led the club's Green Devil mascot around New Lawn Stadium in front of the fans. \n \"Primary Stars has really helped me to go forward on to the next steps and try to achieve more things,\" he says. \n About PL Primary Stars \n Forest Green Rovers are one of 105 professional football clubs from across the leagues that run Premier League Primary Stars sessions in local schools. \n It is the second year in which the club have been involved in the programme, which provides teachers and parents with free downloadable resources across a range of curriculum subjects at Key Stage 1 (age 5-7 years) and Key Stage 2 (age 7-11 years). \n The resources, which are free, have been developed for teachers by teachers, and in collaboration with experts such as the\u00a0 National Literacy Trust \u00a0and the\u00a0 PSHE Association . \n Visit\u00a0 PLPrimaryStars.com \u00a0 for more information. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 Premier League celebrates five years of PL Primary Stars Part 2:  William's story (Leicester City) Part 4:  Stephanie's story (Charlton Athletic) Part 5:  Faizan's story (Burnley) Part 6:  Godolphin Academy's story Part 7:  Freya's story (Newport County) Part 8:  Delia's story (Everton) \n",

This was after averaging 61.6 per cent in the Championship promotion campaign that preceded it. \n Last season they averaged 60.7 per cent of possession, so Fulham will likely opt for a balanced approach once again, with 50 per cent an achievable target. \n With Mitrovic at his best when crosses are sent in, it is unlikely they will sit back and become counter-attacking specialists. \n High tempo \n Fulham's style is not one-dimensional under Silva, so they should cope well with the tactical adaptations required. \n He encourages possession play, but also favours high-tempo football that sees his players press with great energy. \n Fulham were very strong in this department last term, with only Coventry City winning the ball more. \n Most shots/goals after high turnovers 21/22 \n \n \n \n Team \n Shots \n Goals \n \n \n \n \n COV \n 71 \n 6 \n \n \n FUL \n 66 \n 9 \n \n \n BOU \n 59 \n 6 \n \n \n \n Fulham\u2019s attacking prowess means they should carry a goal threat home and away in 2022/23. \n Their main concern could be how they cope defensively. \n Five Championship sides kept more clean sheets than Fulham last term, who on occasion looked vulnerable. \n In home defeats by Huddersfield Town,  Nottingham Forest , Sheffield United and Coventry, they struggled to deal with opponents who closed them down inside their own half. \n Having leaked 43 goals, almost one goal per match, Fulham may look to invest in several new defensive players. \n The Cottagers have plenty of talent and a clearly defined style. But they must still recruit well, especially at the back, if they are to avoid another relegation battle.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  Wilson to deliver for Fulham again Part 3:  Parker has the tools to succeed Part 4:  Kelly and Billing key for Cherries Part 5:  Forest counters can cause problems Part 6:  Johnson and Yates offer pace and craft \n",

His position in 2022/23 Fantasy is therefore expected to reflect that role. \n The underlying numbers further highlight the Wales international's huge influence on Forest's attack. \n His 94 shots and 68 shots in the box were both team-leading totals, while his 60 chances created ranked second. \n Johnson's playoff strike v Sheff Utd \n \n \n That man again \ud83c\udff9  \ud83c\udf33\ud83d\udd34  #NFFC   pic.twitter.com/zQ2hxuBgYU \n\u2014 Nottingham Forest FC (@NFFC)  May 17, 2022 \n \n All-round improvement \n Fellow forward  Lewis Grabban  improved his output under the new head coach, claiming 10 goals and three assists in 25 appearances.\u00a0 \n Cooper mainly preferred a 3-4-1-2 system, which lifted Forest\u2019s defensive output in 2021/22.\u00a0 \n Sixteen of their 17 clean sheets for the season came in his 38 matches at the helm, of which nine were at home and seven away. \n Forest goalkeeper  Brice Samba  was kept busy last term and his average of 31.5 minutes per save proved quicker than any promoted No 1. \n Centre-back  Scott McKenna  offers attacking potential, with two goals and three assists last term. \n However, Cooper\u2019s transfer business over the summer will be vital in assessing the Forest defence. \n New-look backline \n Djed Spence and Max Lowe thrived as wing-backs in 2021/22 but both players were on loan and have since returned to their parent clubs.\u00a0 \n Spence produced two goals and four assists in 41 outings, while Lowe combined one goal with four assists from 21 matches.\u00a0 \n Replacing Philip Zinckernagel, another loanee, is also likely to be a top priority. Playing in an advanced central role behind the front two, he scored six goals and assisted a further seven. \n Ultimately, it is Johnson who looks the go-to pick for Forest, although Cooper\u2019s new wing-backs will definitely be worth monitoring over a kind run of fixtures. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 Robinson an all-round prospect Part 2:\u00a0 Look to Mitrovic and Wilson for value Part 3:\u00a0 Rely on Travers for save points Part 4:  Solanke can deliver value \n",

    "text": "\n After the release of the 2022/23 fixtures, The Scout picks out five defenders with promising early schedules who should be considered for opening  Fantasy Premier League  squads. \n Marc Cucurella (BHA) \n Brighton & Hove Albion\u2019 s wing-back offers many routes to returns over a very kind opening run of opponents. \n The Seagulls face just one of last season's top-six sides in their first eight matches, away to  Manchester United  in Gameweek 1. \n Cucurella combined a goal and an assist with 11 clean sheets and 21 bonus over his 35 appearances last term, his total of 126 points at least 31 more than any defensive team-mate. \n The underlying numbers further highlight his creative potential. \n From the point of his debut in Gameweek 4, Cucurella's 42 key passes were bettered by only four other defenders in Fantasy. \n Trent Alexander-Arnold (LIV) \n Last season's top-scoring defender has the schedule to immediately reward investors. \n Liverpool  face just one of the top six sides from 2021/22 in their opening seven matches, away to Man Utd in Gameweek 3. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n That gives Alexander-Arnold the chance to find the form that produced two goals, 12 assists, 18 clean sheets and 32 bonus in the previous campaign. \n His ability to deliver huge hauls in Fantasy will make him a key figure in many managers' backlines, his eight double-figure hauls at least two more than any other defender in Fantasy last term. \n Joao Cancelo (MCI) \n Manchester City 's kind run of opponents looks encouraging for the Portuguese to get off to another fast start.\u00a0 \n The champions are the only side to avoid all of last season's top six in their first six fixtures.\u00a0 \n Cancelo was the top-scoring defender in the opening six Gameweeks last term, amassing 44 points thanks to two assists and five clean sheets. \n That set the tone for the campaign, with the 28-year-old ending as the fifth top-scoring player overall on 201 points.\u00a0 \n Cancelo's total of 81 shots was at least 30 more than any other defender in 2021/22, also bettering all of his Man City team-mates. \n Jonny (WOL) \n The wing-back could emerge as the best route into a  Wolverhampton Wanderers  defence that claimed 11 clean sheets last term. \n Jonny also impressed in attack after returning from long-term injury, scoring twice in 10 starts. \n Bruno Lage's men have three favourable home matches with  Fulham ,  Newcastle United  and  Southampton  in the opening six Gameweeks, as well as trips to  Leeds United  and  AFC Bournemouth . \n Ben Chilwell (CHE) \n Chelsea 's left wing-back made a huge impression at both ends of the pitch last term, before being sidelined through injury. \n Chilwell amassed 54 points in a run of six starts, combining three goals and an assist with four clean sheets. \n That all-round potential could make him the go-to Blues defender in 2022/23 Fantasy, particularly if Reece James continues to be used as a centre-back on occasion.\u00a0 \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Pair up Salah and Haaland for captaincy Part 3:  Son among best early armband picks Part 4:  Vardy can make fast start \n",

Patrick Vieira 's Palace  beat Arsenal 3-0  when they met at Selhurst Park in April, and have lost only once in their last eight encounters with the Gunners. \n Hammer time for Haaland \n Man City must negotiate a challenging trip to  West Ham United  that will be televised live on Sky Sports in the UK on Sunday at 16:30 BST. \n Opening-weekend matches in London hold mixed memories for  Pep Guardiola .  Tottenham Hotspur  handed Man City a  1-0 defeat \u00a0last season, while in 2019/20, Guardiola's team  crushed West Ham 5-0  at the London Stadium. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n In their most recent meeting, on 15 May, West Ham gave Man City a big shock, going 2-0 up at half-time before the champions recovered to  draw 2-2  and get their title bid back on track. Guardiola will be hoping the addition of the prolific striker Erling Haaland will bring a more positive start.\u00a0 \n Another Liverpool goal fest? \n It seems goals are guaranteed in the 12:30 BST kick-off on Saturday (live on BT Sport in the UK) as  Liverpool  have been drawn against  Fulham . \n Jurgen Klopp  will open a campaign against a promoted team for the fourth season running and their past three meetings against Watford,  Leeds United  and Norwich City respectively have averaged more than five goals. This might be music to the ears of new Liverpool forward Darwin Nunez, who scored 26 goals in 28 matches for Benfica last season.\u00a0 \n Newcastle test for Forest\u00a0 \n Nottingham Forest  will end their 23-year exile from the Premier League with a trip to  Newcastle United . Forest have one of the best opening-weekend records in Premier League history, but face a Magpies side who were resurgent under  Eddie Howe  in the second half of the season. \n AFC Bournemouth , the other promoted team, will host  Aston Villa  in what is a repeat of the Cherries'  first Premier League fixture . \n Everton 's home tie with  Chelsea , which kicks off at 17:30 BST on Saturday, will bring happy memories for Toffees manager  Frank Lampard . A  1-0 win in May at Goodison , against the club where he is a legend, helped Lampard to steer Everton out of the relegation zone. \n In the other live televised match in the UK,  Erik ten Hag  starts life as  Manchester United  manager at Old Trafford against  Brighton & Hove Albion  in the Sunday 14:00 BST fixture. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Boxing Day derbies galore \n The importance of the Boxing Day fixtures are even greater this season, as they will be the first after the 2022 FIFA World Cup final on Sunday 18 December 2022. \u00a0 \u00a0 Special arrangements have been made to allow more time between matches played across the three festive match rounds giving squads greater time to recover. Previously, clubs were given a minimum of 48 hours between matches.\u00a0 \u00a0 Boxing Day fixtures will be played on 26 and 27 December, with the following Matchweek played across 29-31 December.
