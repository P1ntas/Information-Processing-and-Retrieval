        "text": "\n The Scout looks at the  Fantasy Premier League  potential of the summer signings ahead of the 2022/23 season. \n Erling Haaland (MCI) \u00a311.5m \n The arrival of Haaland at  Manchester City  will have a major impact on how Fantasy managers structure their squads in 2022/23. \n \n \n \n Haaland moves to the Etihad Stadium on the back of 49 goals and 13 assists in 52 Bundesliga appearances for Borussia Dortmund in the last two seasons. \n The forward has also proven his prowess in the UEFA Champions League, scoring 13 goals and supplying two assists in 11 appearances for Dortmund. \n Haaland\u2019s signing can revive the interest in forwards in Fantasy, a position that frustrated managers in 2021/22. \n Harry Kane finished as the top-scoring forward on 192 points, despite managing just one goal and one assist in the first 15 Gameweeks. \n Cristiano Ronaldo, meanwhile, was runner-up to Kane among forwards, yet his 159 points placed only joint-18th overall. \n Midfielders offered big points \n By contrast, eight of the 14 top-scoring players in 2021/22 Fantasy were midfielders. \n Pairing Mohamed Salah with Son Heung-min or Kevin De Bruyne proved a very successful tactic in the second half of 2021/22. \n However, Haaland\u2019s arrival could force a re-think in 2022/23, persuading many to distribute funds more evenly in attack by owning one premium midfielder and one premium forward. \n \n \n HE'S HERE! \ud83d\udc99  pic.twitter.com/JuZEtzTWbv \n\u2014 Manchester City (@ManCity)  June 13, 2022 \n \n Haaland\u2019s signing indicates Pep Guardiola will mainly operate with a lone striker system next season, either in a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 set-up.\u00a0 \n This is likely to increase the chances of rotation on the flanks, with Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, Riyad Mahrez, Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Jesus competing for minutes. \n Penalty taker duties? \n The underlying numbers give an indication of the kind of service Haaland can expect. \n Man City have ranked among the top two sides for big chances in each of Guardiola\u2019s six seasons in charge. \n They have also been among the four top clubs for penalties awarded in five of those campaigns. \n Having scored 24 of his 26 spot-kicks for club and country over his career, there is a strong possibility Haaland will become their first-choice taker ahead of Mahrez.\u00a0 \n Man City under Guardiola \n \n \n \n Season \n Big chances \n Rank \n Penalties \n Rank \n \n \n \n \n 2016/17 \n 101 \n 1 \n 9 \n =2 \n \n \n 2017/18 \n 129 \n 1 \n 8 \n 2 \n \n \n 2018/19 \n 125 \n 1 \n 4 \n =12 \n \n \n 2019/20 \n 141 \n 1 \n 11 \n 2 \n \n \n 2020/21 \n 107 \n 2 \n 9 \n =4 \n \n \n 2021/22 \n 123 \n 2 \n 9 \n =1 \n \n \n \n As the focal point of Man City\u2019s attack, Haaland will be supplied with a multitude of scoring opportunities.\u00a0 \n He has the potential to take 2022/23 Fantasy by storm, forcing managers to reassess their midfield plans in order to spend bigger up front.\u00a0 \n Remember, you can find out who Haaland and his new team-mates will face next season when the 2022/23 fixtures are released on premierleague.com this Thursday at 09:00 BST. \n See:  The Scout's FPL new signings \n",

I will go for  Gabriel Jesus \u00a0or  Bukayo Saka , but I'll definitely have either one or two defenders or one or two attackers from Arsenal. \n \"You have to have three  Manchester City  players.  Erling Haaland \u00a0is one that everyone will want, so you need to have two others, whether that is  Phil Foden ,  Kevin De Bruyne ,  Joao Cancelo \u00a0or any other defender. That will again depend on the World Cup. \n \"I will look to have three  Newcastle United  players as well, depending on how well  Callum Wilson \u00a0does at the World Cup and if he makes it back safely.  Kieran Trippier \u00a0is a shoo-in as well. And one more, whether that's  Miguel Almiron \u00a0or  Sven Botman . \n \"I feel like  Liverpool  will have a better second half of the season. How much I commit to Liverpool is the key part of how I think about this 'Wildcard' over the World Cup.  Mohamed Salah \u00a0isn't going to the World Cup, he will have a nice rest. Whether you commit to him or not will be a big question.\" \n Look at the players getting a rest \n Gianni Buttice  believes it will be wise to pick players who are not at the World Cup. \n \"Players who are getting a rest will have a slight advantage,\" he says. \"They'll have what feels like a pre-season. There's  Haaland  and  Salah  of course, but also players like  Andreas Pereira ,  Almiron  and  Jarrod Bowen . These guys will get a rest. \n \"There will also be players who might have a little bit of a point to prove, to say, 'I should have been at the World Cup. Come Gameweek 17, I'm going to hit the ground running.' \n \"I also like the look of  Manchester United , who have got three really nice fixtures. Perhaps we could invest in that United defence, with  Diogo Dalot  and  Luke Shaw \u00a0as options. Perhaps we'll see  Marcus Rashford \u00a0or  Anthony Martial\u00a0 becoming more-popular assets.\" \n Snap up the forgotten stars \n Sam Bonfield  is looking to surprise her mini-league rivals by bringing in players who have been largely forgotten due to injury. \n \"Players like  Luis Diaz \u00a0and  Diogo Jota \u00a0are both due back from injury for Liverpool ahead of Gameweek 17,\" she says. \"If they can bed in nicely during this kind of pre-season, they might be players to target too.\" \n Sam believes certain clubs will be overlooked too due to their lowly league position, with Fantasy managers missing the fact that they return to action with an enticing run of matches. \n \" Southampton  for me are standout picks right now they're top of the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  and are potentially about to experience a new-manager bounce under Nathan Jones,\" she says. \"They have some great assets like  James Ward-Prowse \u00a0and  Che Adams . \n \" West Ham United  have really nice fixtures after the World Cup too, so they're another team I'll be looking to target alongside Man City, Arsenal, Newcastle, and a couple of  Spurs  players.\" \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  FPL experts' best and worst decisions in 2022/23 Part 2:  FPL experts' best and worst players in 2022/23 Part 3:  FPL experts' top strategies in 2022/23 \n",

        "text": "\n With the FIFA World Cup bringing a pause to  Fantasy Premier League  after this Gameweek, FPL managers will be able to make unlimited free transfers following Saturday's deadline and before the Premier League returns for Gameweek 17 on 26 December. \n The Scout's  panel of experts  discuss how they are going to plan ahead. \n See:\u00a0 FPL and FIFA World Cup: All you need to know about free transfers \n What the experts say \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n The unlimited transfer window is a really exciting time for FPL managers. With player prices frozen during the World Cup this will be an opportunity for managers to focus on the players that they think are \"must haves\" rather than catching and avoiding the changes. \n Players like  Miguel Almiron  (\u00a35.8m),  Mohamed Salah  (\u00a312.7m) and  Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.1m) will not be playing at the World Cup and will therefore be key targets for managers. \n Others will depend on how far their countries progress in the World Cup. I will also be looking at  Southampton  players as part of my unlimited transfer plans. With their new manager having time to work with his side during the World Cup and a great run of fixtures through to Gameweek 23, players like  Che Adams  (\u00a36.4m) and  James Ward-Prowse  (\u00a36.2m) could be good differentials. \n Lateriser ( @lateriser12 ) \n Manchester United  will be fairly popular in Gameweek 17. They have already played all of the top-six sides this season.  Diogo Dalot  (\u00a34.8m),  Luke Shaw  (\u00a34.7m),  Marcus Rashford  (\u00a36.7m) and  Anthony Martial  (\u00a36.7m) are players I will be looking at. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Southampton,  Newcastle United  and  Liverpool \u00a0have great matches\u00a0between Gameweeks 17 and 22, going by the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings , so I will be looking to target players from these teams. Players like  Callum Wilson  (\u00a37.5m) and  Allan Saint-Maximin  (\u00a36.2m) could be good picks. Southampton will also be interesting to watch for a new manager bounce.  \n I'll mostly have my eyes on Liverpool's  Luis Diaz  (\u00a37.8m) and  Diogo Jota  (\u00a38.8m), who are both due back from injury after the World Cup too. \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n It's been a painful few weeks not owning  Arsenal  midfielders  Bukayo Saka  (\u00a38.0m) and  Gabriel Martinelli  (\u00a36.8m), so they'll be key Gameweek 17 picks for me. I plan to triple up on Arsenal assets. They are one of the clubs with a match in hand this season. \n Nick ( @WGTA_Nick )\u00a0 \n Newcastle have been in excellent form this season and they have a great fixture run post-World Cup as well, so I will definitely keep their players in my team. Otherwise I'll be targeting Liverpool,  Manchester City  and also Southampton players. The likes of  Adams  and  Ward-Prowse  could be interesting differentials. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n Before even looking at individuals, I will be identifying teams I want to cover with Arsenal and Newcastle at the top of my list, alongside triple Man City of course.  \n Andy Park ( @FPL_Sonaldo ) \n It's hard to ignore  Darwin   Nunez  (\u00a38.9m) as an FPL asset when he's playing and in full flow. Although he seems to hit the crossbar as much as  Bryan Mbeumo  (\u00a35.8m), I feel his haul potential is there every time. I like the fact that as an FPL asset he keeps his head down and thinks of shooting first before passing. He could be a big differential come Gameweek 17. \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n Nunez ,  Saka  and  Wilson  are the three somewhat less popular picks that, at the moment, I definitely see myself owning come Gameweek 17. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 GW15 Lessons: Almiron a long-term buy in Fantasy \n GW16 deadline: 11:00 GMT, Sat 12 Nov \n",

        "text": "\n Here are some facts about transfers that help to explain how deals get done, why the transfer window exists and the processes that are required for deals. \n For more details download the\u00a0 Premier League Handbook  (PDF size: 16MB) \n Authorised signatory \u2013  Any player contract and transfer agreement must be signed by an authorised signatory of the club. This means an official of a club duly authorised by a resolution of its board of directors to sign forms as required by these rules. \n Board \u2013  All player registrations are subject to approval of the Premier League Board. \n Compensation fee \u2013  This is the sum of money agreed by two clubs for the transfer of the registration of a player and is generally made by telegraphic transfer. (see Rule V.26 of the Handbook) \n Deal sheets \u2013  Sometimes it is not easy for clubs to get everything on a deal completed and sent over to the Premier League by the deadline. The deal sheet allows a club to confirm that a deal has been reached and to allow for additional time to submit the remaining documentation. \n The sheet cannot be used until two hours before the deadline and needs to arrive fully completed before the transfer window closes. Once the sheet arrives, clubs have an additional two hours after the window closes to submit the full paperwork. But if a club are looking to complete an international transfer, they still have to comply with the FIFA TMS of deadline of midnight. \n Deadlines -  The Premier League summer 2022 transfer window closed at 23:00 BST on 1 September 2022. January 2023's winter transfer window opened on 1 January 2023 and closes at 23:00 GMT on 31 January 2023. \n EPFL transfer window countdown \u2013  the European Professional Football Leagues website provides a handy overview to the  deadline days of the transfer window across the Continent . \n Exceptional temporary transfer (aka emergency loan) \u2013  Under rule V.7.6.2 clubs the temporary transfer of a goalkeeper in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d, subject to Board permission, can take place outside the transfer window. \n Eligibility \u2013  Where applicable, a club\u2019s application to register a player has to be accompanied by evidence to allow the League to demonstrate that the player may take up employment in the UK. The League will not confirm the player is eligible to play for the club applying to register him until it has received such evidence. (Rule U.13) See also Permits (Work) and International transfer Certificate. \n Fax -  Documentation is no longer through fax machines, but by desktop faxes or scanned documents sent by email. \n Gross \u2013  The FA rules that all remuneration in contracts of players transferred be stated in gross (i.e. before PAYE and National Insurance deductions). \n Home grown players \u2013  A \"Home Grown Player\" (HGP) means a player who, irrespective of his nationality or age, has been registered with any club affiliated to The Football Association or the Football Association of Wales for a period, continuous or not, of three entire seasons or 36 months before his 21st birthday (or the end of the season during which he turns 21). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Conor Gallagher was one of the home grown players who moved to a PL club in the summer of 2021, joining Palace on loan\n             \n \n International Transfer Certificate \u2013  For any player registered outside The FA or the FAW and wanting to play in the Premier League, the FA or FAW must have issued to them an International Transfer Certificate from the national association he is leaving. \n Loans \u2013 \u00a0These are officially called temporary transfers. Under Premier League rules, there are restrictions on how many players Premier League clubs can loan from other Premier League/English clubs. They are: - Premier League clubs may not register more than two players on loan at any one time. - The maximum number of loans registrable in the same season is four, and, under no circumstances, shall more than one be from the same club at any one time. - Premier League clubs cannot loan to another Premier League club a player they have acquired in the same transfer window. - A Premier League club may loan not more than one of its goalkeepers to another Premier League club \n With the exception of Welsh clubs competing in the competitions listed under Rule V.6.2, loans from a club in membership of another National Association do not count towards the above quotas. \n Medical \u2013  All players transferred from one club to another have medical examinations to determine their fitness before a contract is signed. When clubs are negotiating a temporary transfer, the club looking to acquire the player can request the club where he is registered to provide his medical records. \n Net spend \u2013  the amount of money spent on transfers by clubs that includes spending of compensation fees received for players transferred. \n Out of contract -  If a player is out of contract prior to the close of the window he is free to approach and sign for a club outside the transfer window, but the club must gain the approval of the Premier League Board. \n Points-based-system -  Players with passports from outside the European Union and the European Economic Area need permission to work in the UK. The UK Home Office has a points-based system based on which clubs must apply to The FA for a \"Governing Body Endorsement\" for such players. (See p625 of the  Premier League Handbook ) \n If the player does not automatically meet these criteria, the club can request an FA Exceptions Panel consider the player\u2019s experience and value in order to determine whether a Governing Body Endorsement should nevertheless be granted. \n Registration -  To register a player, clubs have to send the Premier League all the documents relating to the transfer, including but not limited to the player\u2019s contract, the transfer agreement, permission to work in the UK (if required), international clearance if transferring from abroad International Transfer Certificate). For a player transferring from abroad, providing that the relevant papers have been submitted in time, ITC can be received up to 75 minutes before kick-off for a player to be eligible. \n Squad list \u2013  After the closure of the transfer window each Premier League club must submit a squad list containing no more than 17 players who do not fulfil the \"Home Grown Player\" (HGP) criteria. The remainder of the squad, up to a total of 25 players, must be home grown. Under-21 players are eligible over and above the limit of 25 players per squad. For the 2022/23 campaign Under-21 players will have been born on or after 1 January 2001. \n Third-party ownership -  The Premier League outlawed third-party ownership of players in 2007. The Premier League needs to be satisfied that any player joining one of its clubs has no third-party interests in his economic rights in order for him to be formally registered. \n Transfer Matching System -  When there is an international transfer, the buying and selling clubs have to register it on the FIFA Transfer Matching System (TMS) in order for international clearance to be generated. The buying club have to upload all the information to the system and the foreign club have to match all the details. The English FA will request clearance and as long everything matches; the foreign association will issue clearance to The FA, who then informs the club and League. The Premier League receives a copy because it needs to ensure that players coming in have had their registration transferred to this country, or Wales, in the case of Swansea City. \n UEFA \u2013  The deadline for registrations for UEFA competitions is 23:00 BST 1 September. \n V \u2013  Section V of the Premier League Handbook, consists of all the rules pertaining to the transfer of player registrations. \n Window \u2013  The transfer window as it exists started in 2002/03 and was introduced as part of a compromise agreement between FIFA and the European Commission about how the whole transfer system worked and how it could best preserve contractual stability for both the player and the club while allowing movement at prescribed times during the year \u2013 the summer and winter transfer windows in effect. \n X -  Xherdan Shaqiri was an example of where suspensions imposed by other national associations carry over into the association where the player will be registered. After being signed by Stoke City in summer 2015 Shaqiri was forced to miss the first match he was available for, away to Tottenham Hotspur, because of a one-match ban received in the Coppa Italia while at Inter Milan. \n Youth \u2013  scholars joining clubs are subject to the same transfer windows but not English scholars. \n Z -  Section Z of the rulebook covers the resolution of disputes over player contracts \n See:  January 2023 Transfers and News \n",

Everyone associated with the club will be eagerly looking forward to finding out his first opponents when the fixtures for the new season are released on 16 June. \n How Haaland scored in the Bundesliga \n \n \n \n Style \n Range \n \n \n \n \n Left foot \n 47 \n 0-6 yards \n 18 \n \n \n Right foot \n 9 \n 7-18 yards \n 42 \n \n \n Header \n 5 \n 18+ yards \n 1 \n \n \n \n Haaland has a devastating left foot that rarely lets him down. It is responsible for 77 per cent of his Bundesliga goals for Dortmund. \n He strikes the ball as powerfully as anyone but is also capable of producing delicate finesse in 1v1 situations.\u00a0He is blessed with outstanding natural finishing instincts. \n Haaland's consistency in Germany \n \n \n \n Season \n Starts \n Goals \n Mins/goal \n \n \n \n \n 2019/20 \n 11 \n 13 \n 81.8 \n \n \n 2020/21 \n 27 \n 27 \n 89.3 \n \n \n 2021/22 \n 20 \n 21 \n 86.9 \n \n \n \n Haaland has averaged a goal every 86 minutes during a phenomenal two-and-a-half-year spell in Germany. \n In his first 18 months at Dortmund he never went longer than two league matches without a goal. His longest goalless stretch last season was five matches. \n Leading the line for  Pep Guardiola\u2019s  attacking side will virtually guarantee that Haaland receives a glut of quality chances. \n Running in behind the defence \n Haaland\u2019s pace and movement will give Man City a new dimension. \n When they use an attacking midfielder as a \"false nine\", City rely on slick interplay and runners from deep to exploit the spaces created. \n Haaland will offer more of a direct threat. He loves to make runs beyond the last defender and is at his devastating best when there is room to surge into. \n Out of his 61 Bundesliga goals, 25 have come from situations where he has run into space ahead of him to shoot, a 41 per cent share of his total output. \n Haaland's goal variety \n \n \n \n Goal types \n % of Haaland's goals \n \n \n \n \n Running into space \n 41.0% \n \n \n Converting crosses \n 31.0% \n \n \n Others \n 16.5% \n \n \n Penalties \n 11.5% \n \n \n \n Under Guardiola, Man City are excellent at getting into areas where they send a stream of low crosses or passes across the face of goal. \n That will suit Haaland, who has a nose for tap-ins. \n While his heading ability has improved this term, he scores more regularly when getting on the end of low crosses at close range. \n He makes clever movements in the box and is strong enough to brush off defenders to bundle the ball home inside the six-yard box. \n Getting the best from Haaland\u00a0 \n I doubt Guardiola will alter his successful approach completely following Haaland's arrival, but there is likely to be a tactical tweak. \n This season, I'd expect to see City play a greater number of early, progressive forward passes for their signing to run on to, with the use of a \"false nine\" less prevalent. \n Haaland is a generational talent who can take the Premier League by storm when  the 2022/23 season kicks off on 6 August . \n His early summer capture is a real sign of intent from the champions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n See:   Talking Tactics: New signings for 2022/23 \n",

Owned by under three per cent of managers, he looks like a top differential. \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n With doubts surrounding the fitness of Richarlison (\u00a38.4m),\u00a0 Dejan Kulusevski  (\u00a38.0m) looks the perfect differential. Kulusevski returned from injury in Gameweek 15 and produced back-to-back returns.  \n Having been well rested, the 4.9%-owned Swede looks to be an excellent differential pick. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n With Cristiano Ronaldo having left  Man Utd , I'm intrigued to see whether it brings the best out of  Bruno Fernandes  (\u00a39.8m)\u00a0on a consistent basis. United will need his leadership, quality in the middle of the park and possibly his penalty prowess as they begin the post-Ronaldo era. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n Chelsea  have a few players who will be looking to bounce back from disappointment.  Raheem Sterling  (\u00a39.7m) hasn't really started firing for the Blues, but I'll back him for attacking returns  at home to AFC Bournemouth . \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n With Ronaldo gone and  Martial  having time to build up his fitness over the World Cup break, the Frenchman is a great differential at home to  Forest . \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n Kyle Walker  (\u00a34.8m)\u00a0looks to be a great differential, just as he was back in Gameweek 1.  Manchester City  are a side to treble up on ahead of their scheduled Double Gameweeks, with Walker set to make a mockery of his price tag. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n Diogo Dalot  (\u00a34.8m) had a fantastic World Cup and I expect him to continue his good form against Forest, providing he is passed fit. The right-back's attacking threat suggests he can prove to be a steal. \n See:\u00a0 Your essential FPL tips for Gameweek 17 \n",

        "text": "\n With the season paused for the FIFA World Cup 2022,  Fantasy Premier League  experts have been tinkering with their squads. \n FPL managers can make  unlimited transfers  until the action resumes on 26 December. \n Andy Park, also known as  FPL_Sonaldo , talks us through his new squad for Gameweek 17. \n Goalkeepers \n Danny Ward  (\u00a34.1m): At his price,  Leicester City 's keeper is too enticing to give up. \n Daniel Iversen  (\u00a33.9m): When selecting a set-and-forget option, I like to choose my main goalkeeper's back-up. \n Defenders \n Kieran Trippier  (\u00a35.9m):  Newcastle United  have proven to be an unbelievable team this season. They're an elite defensive side and equally good going forward. \n Joao Cancelo  (\u00a37.4m); This is just a no-brainer pick.  Manchester City  look to have the potential for a lot of clean sheets after the World Cup and he offers some attacking threat. \n Andrew Robertson  (\u00a36.8m): This is a player I am excited to own.  Liverpool 's fixtures are very good for the next seven or eight Gameweeks, and the Scot has great potential with his attacking threat. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Ben White  (\u00a34.7m): A great-value pick. Fantasy managers want a piece of  Arsenal 's defence, who have been extremely good this season. White also has some good attacking potential, despite his budget-enabling price point. \n Neco Williams  (\u00a34.0m): For my fifth-defender slot, I like to have a player I am happy to bench. While  Nottingham Forest \u00a0haven\u2019t kept many clean sheets, Williams has great attacking potential. \n Midfielders\u00a0 \n Mohamed Salah  (\u00a312.8m): He should be in all unlimited transfer squads. The Egyptian has been resting during this period, meaning he will be fresh when the season resumes. \n Gabriel Martinelli  (\u00a36.8m): At this price point, he is probably the best-value player in Fantasy. \n Miguel Almiron\u00a0 (\u00a35.8m): He is extremely budget-friendly. He is one of the highest-scoring players this season and he's going to continue that form after the World Cup. \n Marcus Rashford  (\u00a36.7m):  Manchester United  have three amazing fixtures between Gameweeks 17 and 19. They host Forest and  AFC Bournemouth  either side of a trip to  Wolverhampton Wanderers .\u00a0While United have provided a mixed bag in terms of FPL returns this season, I think it's wise to invest in Rashford. \n Andreas Pereira  (\u00a34.6m): The  Fulham  player will continue to be my fifth midfield option and is a solid option for his price this season. You can't rely on him every Gameweek, but this is fine for a player who will often be benched. \n Make changes to your own FPL squad now \n Forwards \n Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.2m): He is going to be the perma-captain for FPL managers in most Gameweeks. \n Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a38.0m): Partnering Haaland in my attack, Jesus is just one of those players with extremely high Expected Goal Involvement (xGI) and he's very involved in most matches. \n Darwin Nunez  (\u00a39.0m): The Uruguayan is second in terms of Expected Goals (xG) after Haaland. He is one of those exciting picks that you really want in your team no matter who he's playing. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Nick Harris' GW17 squad Part 3:  Gianni Buttice's GW17 squad Part 4:  Pras' GW17 squad Part 5:  Sam Bonfield's GW17 squad \n",

        "text": "\n The transfer of  Raheem Sterling  from  Manchester City  to  Chelsea  is a rare occurrence of a player moving from one of the traditional top-six clubs to another.\u00a0 \n At Man City, Sterling won 10 trophies, including four Premier League titles, but he is hungry for more.\u00a0 \"I've obviously achieved a lot in my career so far, but there is still so much more to achieve and I'm really looking forward to doing that in a Chelsea shirt,\" he told  Chelsea's official website . \n We have looked at five players who swapped one big club for another in search of silverware.\u00a0 \n Eric Cantona \u00a0 \n Leeds United  are not part of the traditional top six but back in the inaugural season of the Premier League, in 1992, they were the defending league champions. \n So their decision to sell Cantona to  Manchester United  was a surprise. The France international inspired  Sir Alex Ferguson 's side to four Premier League titles, including two league and FA Cup Doubles, to crown his enduring legacy as a Man Utd legend. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Teddy Sheringham \u00a0 \n In June 1997 Sheringham left  Tottenham Hotspur  to join Man Utd as a replacement for Cantona, following the Frenchman's unexpected retirement. \n The 31-year-old England striker completed a fearsome forward line that comprised  Andrew Cole ,  Dwight Yorke  and  Ole Gunnar Solskjaer . Sheringham was an integral member of the side who clinched the unprecented Treble of Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League in 1999. \n Indeed, it was he who scored the stoppage-time equaliser that paved the way for their dramatic turnaround victory over Bayern Munich in the Champions League final. He went on to win two more titles in his four-season spell with the Red Devils. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Sol Campbell\u00a0 \n In the summer of 2001, Campbell stunned the footballing world by leaving Spurs to join north London rivals  Arsenal  on a free transfer. \n Campbell justified his controversial and ambitious move by winning two Premier League titles and FA Cups, including a Double, as well as establishing himself as one of the \"Invincibles\", who went unbeaten for the entirety of the 2003/04 season. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Ashley Cole \u00a0 \n In 2006, after seven seasons at Arsenal, Cole swapped the red of the Gunners for Chelsea blue. \n His decision to join a club he believed to be better placed to win major honours was rewarded by a third Premier League title in 2009/10 as well as four more FA Cups \u2013 taking his total to a record seven for a player. \n He also helped Chelsea win the 2011/12 UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League the following campaign during a glittering eight-season spell at Stamford Bridge. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Robin van Persie \n In the summer of 2012, after eight seasons at Arsenal and back-to-back Golden Boots, Van Persie decided to pass up his Gunners captaincy and make the move to Man Utd. \n The Netherlands striker's impact at Old Trafford was instant, as he scored 26 Premier League goals to help United win the 2012/13 title. \n He memorably struck all the goals in a  3-0 victory over Aston Villa  that sealed the title, including a thunderous volley for the ages. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

        "text": "\n Signings go a long way to turning a good team into a great team, and the first 10 in  Jose Mourinho 's first spell as  Chelsea  manager proved to be pivotal. \n As the Premier League celebrates its 30th anniversary, we take a look at how the players Mourinho brought in took the Blues to another level.\u00a0 \n Paulo Ferreira \n The versatile Portuguese defender became the first player to follow Mourinho from Porto and was integral to their first two title wins, going on to spend nine seasons with the club. Following his retirement, Ferreira took up a role as loan player technical coach and was also a club ambassador, before departing Stamford Bridge earlier this year. \n Alex \n Despite arriving from Santos in 2004, the Brazilian defender would have to wait another three years to make his debut for Chelsea, having spent that time on loan at PSV. A free-kick expert, Alex helped the club to claim the title in 2009/10. He announced his retirement in 2016. \n Arjen Robben \n The Dutchman was one of the most promising wingers in European football following his switch from PSV and would become a fan-favourite during his three seasons with Chelsea. After winning two PL winner's medals, he departed in 2007 and would enjoy a stellar career with Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. Robben retired for a second time in 2021, following a brief spell at Groningen, the club where he started. \n Mateja Kezman \n Much was expected of Kezman following a prolific spell with PSV Eindhoven, but the forward managed only four Premier League goals in his one season at Stamford Bridge. He did, however, net the winner in the League Cup final to earn Mourinho his first piece of silverware with the club. Kezman retired in 2012 and became a football agent. \n Didier Drogba \n Signed from Marseille, the Ivorian would eventually go on to become one of the competition's most dominant strikers. He won three titles and two Golden Boots in his first spell at Stamford Bridge, before returning in 2014 to claim a fourth winners' medal when reunited with Mourinho. Drogba ended his playing career in the United States with Montreal Impact and Phoenix Rising before retiring in 2018. \n Tiago \n An often overlooked member of Mourinho's first Chelsea squad, Tiago featured 34 times in the Premier League and was a reliable performer. Following a single season at the club, the midfielder would go on to play for Lyon, Juventus and Atletico Madrid, retiring in 2017. He enjoyed a stint as Atletico Madrid assistant manager in 2017/18, before a short spell as Vitoria Guimaraes manager in 2020. \n Ricardo Carvalho \n Carvalho was another member of Mourinho's Porto side that made the switch to Stamford Bridge in 2004. The Portuguese would play a central role as Chelsea broke numerous defensive records during his debut campaign. After three PL titles, he joined Real Madrid in 2010, before retiring seven years later. Carvalho worked as assistant manager under former Chelsea boss  Andre Villas-Boas  between 2019 and 2021. \n Jiri Jarosik \n A January transfer window signing, Jarosik made 14 appearances before joining Birmingham City on loan for the 2005/06 season. After a loan spell with Celtic, he played for clubs including Real Zaragoza and Sparta Prague, before hanging up his boots in 2015. Jarosik has since forged a successful coaching career, and he is currently manager of FK Teplice. \n Asier Del Horno \n The Spanish left-back joined from Athletic Bilbao in June 2005 and in a brief spell at the club, he made 25 appearances, scoring once. After one season at Stamford Bridge he returned to Spain with Valencia. Del Horno retired in 2012. \n Lassana Diarra \n A bit-part player for Chelsea, the midfielder made 13 Premier League appearances during his three seasons with the Blues. After spells at clubs including  Arsenal , Portsmouth, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, Diarra retired in 2019. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  PL30: The Special One Part 2:  PL30: Chelsea's special 2004/05 title win Part 3:  Test your knowledge of Mourinho's Premier League career \n",

They then face Man City again in the FA Cup at the weekend before playing their second match of the Double Gameweek on the following Thursday at Craven Cottage. This adds additional risk of rotation and injury to FPL managers looking to invest in the Blues. \n The same also applies to the key Fulham players, who have a cup tie against Hull City ahead of their second match in Double Gameweek 19. \u00a0\u00a0 \n Doubles for Man City\u00a0 \n Managers should also be aware of the fixture congestion facing Man City. \n The rearranged fixture for Pep Guardiola's side against Spurs in Double Gameweek 20 means they will potentially play twice a week throughout January, if they progress in both the EFL Cup and FA Cup. \n See:\u00a0 Two possible Double Gameweeks for Man City \n Indeed, if Man City continue to stay in both competitions, they will play twice a week until March. \n If Man City or Spurs need an FA Cup third round replay, their Double Gameweek 20 fixture will be postponed. This means both teams would revert to having a Single Gameweek. Managers will need to be aware of both sides' results in the FA Cup before investing for the possible Double Gameweek. \n Potential pitfalls \n When Fantasy managers are selecting players using their unlimited free transfers, it will be important to try and invest in those who will benefit from Double Gameweeks in January. \n But these clubs, such as Man City, could potentially have as many as nine matches in January. Teams like  Aston Villa  and  West Ham United  have kind fixtures. However, they may only play five times. \n",

People thought we had won the pools but we were actually potless. Because of that, when we met his advisors to put together a deal we agreed to pay Eric something like \u00a3500,000 if we kept him after an initial period of a few months. \n \"It was an immense amount of money for Leeds - not money we had at any rate - but we agreed to it because we had this recommendation from Platini and we judged the most important thing was to get the player, and deal with the rest afterwards.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Leeds won the 1991/92 league title with Cantona in the side\n             \n \n There were difficulties almost immediately. \"Apart from  Lee Chapman , no one in the squad spoke fluent French and for Howard it was a bit of a nightmare,\" Fotherby went on. \"Although we won the title, there was just no connection between them. \n \"We had a disaster against Rangers in the European Cup and were coming up to the point where this additional \u00a3500,000 had to be paid. Howard told me to find Eric another club.\" \n Fotherby had not yet acted on that request when full-back  Mel Sterland  got injured. \n \"I rang United about Denis Irwin, who had been at Leeds as a young boy,\" said Fotherby. \"Martin Edwards said there was no chance, but I asked him to at least speak to (Man Utd manager)  Alex Ferguson . \n \n \n \"Sometimes people just move to a certain club at a certain time and become something they would never have been anywhere else.\" \n \n Bill Fotherby on Eric Cantona \n \n \n \n \"Normally, I wouldn't have expected him to ring back. This time he did, offering me a different player I knew Howard would not be interested in. It was then he asked about Eric. \n \u201cI said absolutely no way and that it was impossible. But obviously I knew what Howard felt about him, and I knew this additional payment was due. \n \"As I had done before, Martin asked if I would talk to Howard. On that particular day Howard was out house-hunting in Leeds, so the only person I actually spoke to was (coach) Mick Hennigan. I just said, 'I can't believe it. Guess what has come right out of the blue. Howard will absolutely love it.' \n \"I left it a couple of hours, rang Martin back and said, 'I can't believe this but Howard is willing to let the boy go'.\" \n And so the deal was rushed through, for a fee thought to be around \u00a31million. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n \"Our fans were bothered,\" said Fotherby. \"They were really bothered.

We got something similar when  Gordon Strachan  came to us and took us from Division Two to champions. Before that, Johnny Giles came from Manchester United and look what he did for Leeds. It happens. \n \"Sometimes people just move to a certain club at a certain time and become something they would never have been anywhere else. The fact it was Manchester United gave it an edge I suppose but they were the ones who made the offer for a player our manager did not want. \n \"Howard was an absolute perfectionist. He wanted his players to be disciplined and adhere to a certain team pattern. Eric just didn't fit it. \n \"Alex Ferguson gave him a free role and probably wasn't quite as strict with Eric as Howard would have been. Eric liked to play to the crowd.

This is because they can make unlimited free transfers after the Gameweek 16 deadline at 13:30 GMT on 12 November and the return of the Premier League on Boxing Day, for Gameweek 17.\u00a0 \n Here is what managers need to know as they plan ahead. \n Will player prices rise and fall during the FIFA World Cup 2022?\u00a0 No, player prices will be frozen during the World Cup.  \n What is the date of last price changes? The last set of price changes will occur on 13 November as a result of transfers that occurred ahead of the GW16 deadline at 11:00 GMT on 12 November.

No, all transfers made after GW16 and ahead of the GW17 deadline will be free transfers and won\u2019t cost you any points. \n Is there a limit on the amount of transfers I can make during the World Cup? No. \n Can I play any chips in GW17? Yes, you can play your Bench Boost, Free Hit or Triple Captain if available. But, you won\u2019t be able to play your Wildcard. \n Can I roll my Wildcard into GW17 and have two Wildcards from GW17 onwards? No, if you still have an available Wildcard, you must play that ahead of GW16 deadline or you will lose it. \n Does the 50 per cent sell-on still exist? Will I have to pay the difference if I sell a player and then get him back in? The price shown on your transfers page is a player's selling price. This selling price may be less than the player's current purchase price as a sell-on fee of 50 per cent will be applied on any profits made on that player. This remains in effect for the World Cup period. For example, Erling Haaland\u2019s current cost is \u00a312.1m. If you owned him at his \u00a311.5m starting price and transferred him out, you\u2019d receive \u00a311.8m. However, if you then decided to bring him back, Haaland would cost you \u00a312.1m. \u00a0 \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout\u2019s panel of  Fantasy Premier League  experts discuss the key dilemmas facing managers when building their Gameweek 17 squads with the unlimited free transfers.\u00a0 \n Lateriser ( @lateriser12 ) \n Arsenal  have a Double Gameweek 23 and some decent fixtures before that. Points seem to be fairly spread out in that team which is why I'll be looking at value picks.  Ben White  (\u00a34.7m) has done well for me so far and is the best budget pick in that defence. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n I'm not that keen on Arsenal's fixtures so think just one or two players is sensible. Their attacking players all have similar potential so it makes sense to go for the cheaper  Gabriel Martinelli  (\u00a36.8m), and if you want a defender I'd opt for  White  as the cheapest option. Their centre-backs have had some attacking returns but are not reliable enough to be worth the extra money. \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n A triple-up from the current league leaders feels a must. In defence, White offers value, even though  Gabriel  (\u00a35.2m) stands out as the one with the highest potential for attacking returns. I will look to double up in attack by pairing  Martinelli  with either  Gabriel Jesus  or  Bukayo Saka  (both \u00a38.0m). The latter will depend on how far England get to in the FIFA World Cup. \n If tight for budget, then  Martin Odegaard  (\u00a36.4m), who is resting over the break due to Norway not qualifying for the FIFA World Cup 2022, could also be a shrewd pick. \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n As Arsenal top the league heading into Gameweek 17 it makes sense to invest heavily in their players, especially with a Double Gameweek 23 on the horizon. With four clean sheets in their last five matches, investing in two defenders could be the best way to double up.  White  offers great value for money alongside Gabriel or  William Saliba  (\u00a35.3m). \n The midfielder slot is more difficult as  Saka  and  Martinelli  look good, although both have progressed in the FIFA World Cup so will have longer away. If forced to choose between the two then Martinelli's price sways me towards him, especially as this allows for more premiums by saving budget. \n Geoff Dance\u00a0( @GeoffreyDance ) \n I am tipping the fit-again  Oleksandr Zinchenko  (\u00a35.0m) to re-establish himself as Arsenal's go-to defender in Fantasy. The Ukrainian's potential for returns at both ends of the pitch, as well as bonus points, makes him an appealing pick with just eight per cent ownership. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n The value in Arsenal lies in their defence and in midfield, with  White, Martinelli  and  Saka  the standouts. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Best Newcastle picks Part 3:  Best \u00a38.0m midfielders Part 4:  How many premiums should managers pick?

        "text": "\n The upcoming Blank Gameweek 12 for  Arsenal  and  Manchester City \u00a0has major implications for\u00a0 Fantasy Premier League \u00a0managers. \n Both clubs have enjoyed outstanding starts to the 2022/23 season, with Man City supplying four of the six top-scoring players in Fantasy. \n Arsenal pair  Gabriel Martinelli  (\u00a36.7m) and  Bukayo Saka  (\u00a37.9m), meanwhile, rank among the five top-scoring midfielders, while  William Saliba  (\u00a35.1m) places third in defence. \n As a result, the key performers from those sides have been hugely popular picks in the opening 11 Gameweeks of 2022/23. \n Indeed, six of the eight most-owned players in Fantasy come from Arsenal or Man City. \n Most-owned players in Fantasy \n \n \n \n Player\u00a0 \n Club \n Ownership \n \n \n \n \n Haaland \n MCI \n 83.8% \n \n \n Jesus \n ARS \n 67.9% \n \n \n Trippier \n NEW \n 55.7% \n \n \n Cancelo \n MCI \n 54.9% \n \n \n Martinelli \n ARS \n 48.0% \n \n \n De Bruyne \n MCI \n 34.8% \n \n \n James \n CHE \n 31.0% \n \n \n Saliba \n ARS \n 29.7% \n \n \n \n Retaining three Arsenal and Man City players and simply benching them for Gameweek 12 can prove a profitable move as they both have very kind schedules from Gameweeks 13-16. \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), three of their next four matches before the season stops for the FIFA World Cup each score only two. \n Certainly, managers who owned  Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.2m) when he cost \u00a311.5m at the start of the season will be happy to hold on to him. \n They would get \u00a311.8m if they sold the Norwegian now but would need to pay an extra \u00a30.4m to buy him back. \n When to play your Wildcard\u00a0 \n Those with Wildcards still remaining should look to play the chip in Gameweek 13 to take advantage of those favourable runs of opponents. \n They can \"dead end\" their squad in Gameweek 12 by selling some of their Arsenal and Man City stars before immediately bringing them back in on the Wildcard. \n Tripling up on Man City trio Haaland,  Phil Foden  (\u00a38.2m) and  Joao Cancelo  (\u00a37.3m) looks a very strong tactic at that point, while Martinelli, Saliba and  Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a38.0m) all have the potential to thrive for Arsenal. \n",

These are all matches in which I would expect them to score goals as well as keep some clean sheets. \n For me, with their form heading into the World Cup, as well as at their price points,  Kieran Trippier  (\u00a35.9m) and  Miguel Almiron  (\u00a35.8m) feel like must-owns. \n Callum Wilson  (\u00a37.4m) could be a great differential option, however, with fellow forwards  Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.2m) and  Harry Kane  (\u00a311.6m) being the top-scoring players in Fantasy. That only leaves space for one other forward and managers might prefer to invest in the likes of  Darwin Nunez  (\u00a39.0m). \n I think there is scope for a second defender in the likes of budget-friendly  Dan Burn  (\u00a34.5m) or midfielders such as  Bruno Guimaraes  (\u00a35.7m) or  Allan Saint-Maximin  (\u00a36.2m). \n Geoff Dance\u00a0( @GeoffreyDance ) \n Although both  Nick Pope  (\u00a35.3m) and Trippier are the top-scoring players in their positions, I am more inclined to pick  Sven Botman  (\u00a34.4m) over the goalkeeper if I double-up on Newcastle\u2019s defence. The Dutchman leads Pope by 38 points to 32 since securing a regular role in Gameweek 9 and his impact has reduced the 'keeper's many routes to returns recently. \n Pope produced eight save points and six bonus in the first eight Gameweeks but has managed only two save points and zero bonus since. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Apart from the  trip to Arsenal in Gameweek 19 , Newcastle's fixtures suggest their star men will prove to be a decent investment.  Trippier  will certainly be in a lot of squads, even if England go deep into the World Cup. \n I'll also look for attacking coverage and with Paraguay not being in Qatar, I'm backing  Almiron  to pick up where he left off in November. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n Newcastle's fixtures and player prices suggest that owning at least two options, if not three, is the best tactic.  Trippier  is a must-have. \n After him I'd prioritise  Wilson \u00a0and then  Pope . Almiron is a great price and in unbelievable form but I wouldn't be surprised to see a run of blanks for him as a marked man. \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n We need to remove past biases from Newcastle and look at them as a top-six, or even a top-four team. They have shown great form at both ends of the pitch and therefore owning a defender and an attacker feels necessary. Trippier is the highest-scoring defender and he should continue where he left off.  Botman \u00a0also offers superb value. \n Up front, a fit Wilson is hard to ignore, but if you are only looking for one attacker, I'd favour  Almiron  as the cheaper alternative. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  Best Arsenal picks Part 3:  Best \u00a38.0m midfielders Part 4:  How many premiums should managers pick?

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at the impact of players who have joined new clubs in the 2022 summer transfer window.\u00a0 \n Armel Bella-Kotchap (SOU) \n Southampton 's new boy is a tall, quick and aggressive centre-back who likes to engage in physical battles with strikers. \u00a0 \n At 20 years of age and with just 19 Bundesliga starts behind him from his time at Bochum, he is still a rookie learning his trade. \u00a0\u00a0 \n But he was highly impressive as a teenager in Bundesliga 2, helping the club earn promotion to Germany\u2019s top flight, and he continued that progress last term. \n Suited to Saints\u00a0 \n Under  Ralph Hasenhuttl , Southampton like to play aggressive football, and when they get that aspect of their play right they can be very difficult opponents. \n The Austrian likes his centre-backs to hold a high line, squeezing up to congest the space that rival attackers are trying to play in. \u00a0 \n This positive, front-foot approach led to  Mohammed Salisu  (78) and  Jan Bednarek  (72) finishing 2021/22 as the Premier League\u2019s top two for interceptions. \u00a0 \n Unsurprisingly, Bella-Kotchap also excels in this area. He loves to get tight to front men and muscle his way past them to break up play. \n Across Europe\u2019s top five leagues last season, he was ranked in the top three per cent for defenders making interceptions. \n Bella-Kotchap stats 2021/22 \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n Ave. per 90 \n Percentile* \n \n \n \n \n Interceptions \n 3.3 \n 97% \n \n \n Pressures \n 12.9 \n 91% \n \n \n Clearances \n 5.8 \n 89% \n \n \n \n *Percentile ranking among defenders in Europe's top five leagues \n The youngster uses his powerful frame to good effect, pressurising forwards as often as possible. \n This leads to the occasional error, where a striker will turn him to get goal-side, but Bella-Kotchap\u2019s combative style is generally successful. \n Most aerial duels won in Bundesliga \n \n \n \n 2021/22 \n Club \n Headers won \n \n \n \n \n Konstantinos Mavropanos \n Stuttgart \n 81.8% \n \n \n Josuha Guilavogui \n Wolfsburg \n 77.8% \n \n \n Dan-Axel Zagadou \n Dortmund \n 76.1% \n \n \n Armel Bella-Kotchap \n Bochum \n 74.4% \n \n \n Mohamed Simakan \n RB Leipzig \n 74.2% \n \n \n \n Southampton\u2019s summer signing is 6ft 2in tall and a dominant presence in the air. \u00a0 \n He is comfortable on the left or right side of a centre-back pairing and wins the bulk of his headers. \u00a0 \n Last season he had the fourth-highest win ratio in the air, prevailing in 74.4 per cent of his aerial duels. \u00a0 \n None of Saints defenders Bednarek (70 per cent), Salisu (62.3 per cent),  Lyanco  (57.6 per cent) or  Jack Stephens  (52 per cent) could match that success rate. \n Scope for development \n It is easy to see why Southampton wanted to invest in this promising talent, who should suit their style of defending under Hasenhuttl. \u00a0 \n He will instantly add competition for places, probably battling it out with Bednarek or Lyanco for a place next to first-choice centre-back Salisu. \n There could be the occasional bump in the road for this young defender as he adapts to English football. But his strong, uncompromising approach is likely to make him a crowd-pleaser at St Mary\u2019s. \n See:   Talking Tactics: New signings for 2022/23 \n",

        "text": "\n Phil Foden   (\u00a38.0m) is among three  Manchester City \u00a0players picked in the best XI for Gameweek 6 of  Fantasy Premier League . \n \n \n \n \n \n AVL \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 1 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Foden  visits  Aston Villa  in a run of consistent form, blanking just once in the last four Gameweeks. \n The England midfielder earned 19 points over that period, scoring once and supplying three assists. \n Having being withdrawn before the hour mark in  Man City\u2019s midweek win over Nottingham Forest , Foden looks set to start against Villa on Saturday.\u00a0 \n He is joined by team-mates  Joao Cancelo  (\u00a37.1m) and  Erling Haaland  (\u00a311.9m) in a 4-3-3 formation, with Haaland handed the armband and  Raheem Sterling  (\u00a310.0m) named as vice-captain.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Nick Pope (NEW) \u00a35.0m \n The  Newcastle United  No 1 offers many routes to returns  at home to Crystal Palace . Pope has amassed 24 points in his first five matches thanks to two clean sheets, five save points and three bonus points.\u00a0 \n Trent Alexander-Arnold (LIV) \u00a37.5m \n Liverpool \u2019s right-back is the most-owned defender in Fantasy, found in over 49 per cent of squads ahead of  a trip to Everton . Despite blanking in four of his five appearances, Alexander-Arnold\u2019s 17-point haul  against AFC Bournemouth \u00a0in Gameweek 4 highlights his potential for huge scores.\u00a0 \n Joao Cancelo (MCI) \u00a37.1m \n Man City\u2019s Portuguese faces Villa as the top-scoring defender in Fantasy. Cancelo has produced 31 points in five appearances, combining a goal and an assist with three clean sheets and four bonus.\u00a0 \n Pervis Estupinan (BHA) \u00a34.5m \n Brighton & Hove Albion\u2019 s new left-back  entertains Leicester City  on the back of a clean sheet and an assist in his first two starts. Since making his debut in Gameweek 4, Estupinan\u2019s five key passes rank joint-top for the Seagulls.\u00a0 \n Neco Williams (NFO) \u00a34.1m \n The  Nottingham Forest  wing-back could prove major value  against an AFC Bournemouth  side who have failed to score in each of their last four matches. Williams\u2019 11 shots and nine key passes both rank among the top two defenders in Fantasy this term. \n Raheem Sterling (CHE) \u00a310.0m \n Chelsea 's summer signing  welcomes West Ham United  in strong home form. Sterling has 20 points from his first two outings at Stamford Bridge, scoring twice and supplying an assist.\u00a0 \n Phil Foden (MCI) \u00a38.0m \n An ownership of under eight per cent makes Foden a huge differential against Villa. \n Dejan Kulusevski (TOT) \u00a38.2m \n A  home meeting with Fulham  looks encouraging for the  Tottenham Hotspur  winger\u2019s prospects this weekend. Kulusevski has made a team-leading 11 key passes and has totalled 16 points across his two home matches.\u00a0 \n Erling Haaland (MCI) \u00a311.9m \n Back-to-back hat-tricks have taken the Norwegian to the top of the player standings on 58 points. Haaland has delivered returns in all five of his appearances in 2022/23 Fantasy and will be a huge armband favourite in Gameweek 6. \n Darwin Nunez (LIV) \u00a38.9m \n Returning from a three-match suspension for the Merseyside derby, Nunez faces an Everton side without a clean sheet this season. Nunez claimed nine points on his previous road trip for Liverpool, thanks to a goal and an assist  at Fulham .\u00a0 \n Gabriel Jesus (ARS) \u00a38.2m \n Arsenal \u2019s Brazilian  visits Manchester United  on the back of three goals and three assists in the last four Gameweeks. Jesus\u2019 18 shots in the box and five big chances both rank among the top three players in 2022/23 Fantasy. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 GW6 Ones to watch: Sterling to continue home run Part 2:  GW6 Differentials: Johnson set to trouble Cherries Part 4:  GW6 Captains: Haaland worth the risk Part 5:  Who to captain in GW6?

Fabianski has 19 points in his last four outings, thanks to one clean sheet, five save points and two bonus. \n Joao Cancelo (MCI) \u00a37.3m \n An average of 8.6 points per home start highlights his captaincy credentials against Brighton. \n Andrew Robertson (LIV) \u00a36.7m \n An ownership of only 3.8 per cent makes the  Liverpool  left-back a huge differential  at Nottingham Forest . Robertson will be fully refreshed after being rested in midweek and can deliver returns at both ends of the pitch. \n Gabriel (ARS) \u00a35.1m \n Arsenal 's centre-back has averaged 5.8 points per away match, keeping a clean sheet in four of his five road trips. Gabriel's aerial threat will be a major weapon  against a Southampton side  who have struggled to defend such situations this season. \n Phil Foden (MCI) \u00a38.4m \n Man City's midfielder is the most-bought player in the Gameweek, earning nearly 400,000 new owners ahead of Saturday's  11:00 BST deadline . Foden has delivered 30 points in his last two home matches, thanks to four goals and an assist. \n James Maddison (LEI) \u00a38.2m \n After serving a one-match ban in Gameweek 12,  Leicester City 's playmaker will be fresh for the  trip to Wolverhampton Wanderers . Maddison has amassed 28 points in his previous four appearances, scoring three goals and providing an assist. \n Bukayo Saka (ARS) \u00a37.9m \n The Arsenal winger visits  Southampton  on the back of only one blank in his last seven appearances. Saka has four goals and four assists over that run, averaging 7.4 points per match from Gameweek 4 onwards. \n Wilfried Zaha (CRY) \u00a37.5m \n Crystal Palace 's talisman  faces Everton  on the back of his fifth goal of the season and an eight-point haul in a  2-1 win over Wolves  in midweek. Zaha can get more returns against an Everton side who have lost their last three fixtures. \n Erling Haaland (MCI) \u00a312.1m \n Man City's Norwegian has 10 goals and two assists in his last four home appearances. Haaland averages 13.6 points per match at the Etihad in his debut season in Fantasy and will again be the go-to captain for millions of managers. \n Darwin Nunez (LIV) \u00a38.8m \n Liverpool's Uruguayan has scored in each of his last two starts ahead of a visit to  Nottingham Forest . Nunez's 12 shots, nine shots in the box and five shots on target are all team-leading totals in the last three Gameweeks. \n Gianluca Scamacca (WHU) \u00a36.8m \n The West Ham forward has netted in each of his last two at home, amassing 17 points. Scamacca's 13 shots in the box in his last four matches place second only to the 17 of Haaland among all players in Fantasy. \n GW13 deadline: 11:00 BST, Sat 22 Oct \u00a0 \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 GW13 Ones to watch: Foden backed for more home joy Part 2: \u00a0 GW13 Differentials: Traore can trouble Leicester Part 4:  GW13 Captains: Salah can outscore Haaland Part 5:  FPL experts: In-form Nunez a prime forward pick \n",

Here is what we learned. \n Nketiah burnishes credentials \n It took a while for  Arsenal  to get going, but they finally found their rhythm at Oxford United, winning 3-0 thanks in part to  Eddie Nketiah . \n With the  long-term injury to Gabriel Jesus , Nketiah has stepped in successfully, adding a brace last night to his two league goals in three appearances.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n \"The decision-making to wait to the last moment shows his quality,\"  Mikel Arteta  told  the club's official website . \"It's not only that - his understanding, his work-rate I think is getting better and better. And I'm really happy with him.\" \n With a north London derby on the horizon, Nketiah is proving a valuable asset.\u00a0 \n Record exit \n Eight Premier League clubs exited at the first opportunity and at least a ninth is guaranteed from  Liverpool  or  Wolverhampton Wanderers , who play a replay next week. \n That will equal the highest such number, back in 2007/08, and it could even be 10 if  Leeds United  lose their replay with Cardiff City. \n Five exits were inevitable, being all-Premier League ties. But for  AFC Bournemouth  and  Everton , the FA Cup defeats mirrored their struggling form in the Premier League, which is the only remaining competition left to them and something upon which to train their full attention given their lowly positions in the table. \n Of the others who went out,  Newcastle United  and  Nottingham Forest  still have other interests, in the EFL Cup this week, while for  Chelsea \u00a0winning the UEFA Champions League might become their best means of qualifying for the competition next season. \n No Haaland, no problem \u00a0 \n If Premier League rivals thought a  Manchester City  team without  Erling Haaland  and  Kevin De Bruyne  would struggle for goals, they will have to think again as  Pep Guardiola 's men hit four past Chelsea. \n Julian Alvarez  offers a different option to Haaland but looks no less effective without it, scoring on his return from the FIFA World Cup 2022. \n The displays of the City Academy prospects such as  Cole Palmer  and  Rico Lewis  alongside more established talent such as  Riyad Mahrez  and  Kyle Walker  makes it even more difficult to establish what is Guardiola\u2019s first XI and makes the fixture pile-up that City face less daunting. \n City fixture pile-up \n Fresh from the FA Cup, the Premier League champions are next involved in the quarter-finals of the EFL Cup this Wednesday and their forthcoming fixtures make for an unflinching glance into what competing on four fronts looks like. \n \n \n \n \n \n MUN \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 1 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 2 \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n 3 - 0 \n \n WOL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 0 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n City are set to play 11 matches in 45 days. \n Those matches include the Manchester derby this Saturday and two fixtures against  Tottenham Hotspur  in the space of 17 days. \n Even a squad as deep as Man City\u2019s looks set to be tested. \n \u00a0 Chelsea struggling \u00a0 \n It is no disgrace to lose to City \u2013 most teams do \u2013 but the nature of the defeat at the Etihad Stadium will be a concern to Chelsea supporters . \u00a0 \n As well as conceding four times, the Blues' struggles to create chances continued as head coach  Graham Potter  identified: \"We're not in a great moment ourselves and even though it was a cagey first 20 minutes, we couldn't attack the back line well enough.\" \n Chelsea are a side in transition and have not been helped by injuries to key players such as  Raheem Sterling ,  Reece James ,  Ben Chilwell  and  N\u2019Golo Kante . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Their fans will hope the signing of  David Datro Fofana  from Molde can inject life into their attack, although press reports suggest further attacking reinforcements might be on the way, with Atletico Madrid\u2019s Joao Felix linked with a loan move. \n Chelsea are closer to the bottom of the table (13 points) than to the top (19 points), so Potter will be keen to rediscover their scoring touch, starting with a tricky looking encounter this  Thursday against Fulham . \n Brighton rock \u00a0 \n Apart from a poor start at  home to Arsenal ,  Roberto De Zerbi  has got  Brighton & Hove Albion  playing a brand of football Potter can only dream of. \n Brighton routed in-form Middlesbrough 5-1 on Saturday, including a brace from the returning  Alexis Mac Allister .

Southampton  claimed a much-needed win for manager  Nathan Jones  in beating  Crystal Palace  ahead of their  trip to relegation rivals Everton  on Saturday. \n Saints face Man City in the EFL Cup on Wednesday first, but will then hope the away victory at Selhurst Park can encourage an improvement in their league form, which reads: played six, lost six.

Owned by a massive 82 per cent, Haaland has averaged 9.8 points per start to establish himself as the go-to captain for millions of managers each Gameweek.\u00a0 \n Harry Kane (TOT) \u00a311.6m, 102pts \n Tottenham Hotspur 's talisman has proven the best premium-priced partner for Haaland in managers' squads, thanks to his all-round style of play. Kane's 12 goals and three assists have helped him collect 21 bonus points, more than any other player. \n Ivan Toney (BRE) \u00a37.4m, 83pts \n Managers have flocked to the  Brentford  forward after his  two goals against Man City \u00a0last weekend. Toney is the top target in the unlimited free transfers period, earning 351,000+ new owners. \n",

Indeed, it is the exact opposite. \n Since the start of the season Foden has found Haaland with only 12 passes, and only 17 have been delivered in the other direction. \n Instead, the duo come alive in the moments that matter. \n When opponents are stretched by a City attack, Haaland and Foden work beautifully with one another to apply the finishing touch. \n A good example was Haaland\u2019s two fabulous assists for Foden in the Manchester derby. \n \n \n A first hat-trick for  @PhilFoden  \ud83c\udfa9\ud83e\ude84 #ManCity   pic.twitter.com/bqFtUKGTU1 \n\u2014 Manchester City (@ManCity)  October 2, 2022 \n \n Remarkably, half of Foden\u2019s passes to Haaland have made a chance, and almost 30 per cent of Haaland\u2019s balls to Foden have been key passes, too. \n When they link up it often produces quality end product. \n Haaland/Foden link-up play \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n Passes \n Chances created \n Success \n \n \n \n \n Foden to Haaland \n 12 \n 6 \n 50.0% \n \n \n Haaland to Foden \n 17 \n 5 \n 29.4% \n \n \n \n Year-on-year improvement \n The departures of  Raheem Sterling  and  Gabriel Jesus  last summer increased Foden\u2019s prospects of securing regular game time and he has capitalised on that in the early weeks of the season. \n Using his ever-growing game intelligence and spatial awareness to good effect, Foden is learning how to time his runs even better than he did before. \n Foden\u2019s growing influence \n \n \n \n Season \n Mins/goal \n Conversion % \n \n \n \n \n 2018/19 \n 329.0 \n 9.1 \n \n \n 2019/20 \n 178.4 \n 19.2 \n \n \n 2020/21 \n 179.2 \n 27.3 \n \n \n 2021/22 \n 237.0 \n 22.0 \n \n \n 2022/23 \n 110.5 \n 35.3 \n \n \n \n When you study his improved conversion rate and minutes-per-goal ratio with past seasons it is clear Foden is busy making another progressive step forward. \n Liverpool know all about Foden\u2019s quality, but stopping him from impacting this high-stakes duel will not be easy. \n",

        "text": "\n The potential for returns at both ends of the pitch earns  Gabriel \u00a0(\u00a35.0m) a place in the Scout Selection for Gameweek 5 of  Fantasy Premier League . \n \n \n \n \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 1 \n \n AVL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n The centre-back scored and earned nine points in  Arsenal\u2019s 2-1 win over Fulham  last weekend. \n He has also helped the Gunners to two clean sheets and collected a further three bonus points. \n A home encounter with Aston Villa can help the Brazilian extend his fine start to the campaign. \n Villa have scored only once in their two road trips, losing on both occasions. \n Gabriel is joined by his  Arsenal  team-mate  Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a38.2m) in a best XI that lines up in a 4-4-2 formation, with  Kevin De Bruyne  (\u00a312.2m) handed the armband and  Harry Kane  (\u00a311.4m) named as vice-captain. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Robert Sanchez (BHA) \u00a34.6m \n Brighton & Hove Albion 's No 1  visits Fulham  on the back of three clean sheets in the first four Gameweeks. Sanchez has also collected two save points and four bonus points this term. \n Trent Alexander-Arnold (LIV) \u00a37.5m \n The right-back\u2019s 17-point haul  against AFC Bournemouth  last weekend highlights his armband prospects a t home to Newcastle United . Alexander-Arnold produced five double-figure scores at Anfield in 2021/22 Fantasy. \n Ruben Dias (MCI) \u00a36.0m \n His threat at set-pieces helped the  Manchester City  centre-back produce two goals and five assists last season. Dias offers strong all-round potential  at home to a Nottingham Forest  side who have scored only twice in their first four contests. \n Reece James (CHE) \u00a36.1m \n Chelsea\u2019 s wing-back has been a reliable source of returns, claiming seven points in three of his first four matches. James has combined a goal and an assist with a clean sheet and five bonus, highlighting his many routes to returns  at Southampton . \n Gabriel (ARS) \u00a35.0m \n The centre-back\u2019s total of five goals last season was joint-top among defenders.\u00a0 \n Kevin De Bruyne (MCI) \u00a312.2m \n The playmaker is likely to offer a rotation-free route into Man City\u2019s attack over the busy schedule. De Bruyne\u2019s 12 shots and 13 chances created both place among the top four players in Fantasy this term. \n Luis Diaz (LIV) \u00a38.1m \n The Colombian has three goals and 23 points in his two home appearances. Diaz is the most-bought midfielder in the Gameweek, earning 436,000+ new owners for the visit of Newcastle. \n Ilkay Gundogan (MCI) \u00a37.6m \n Man City\u2019s German is expected to start against  Nottingham Forest  after being benched last weekend. His assist off the bench  against Crystal Palace  means Gundogan has attacking returns in three successive Gameweeks, earning 22 points in that run. \n Rodrigo (LEE) \u00a36.5m \n Four goals and an assist have taken the Spaniard to the top of the midfielder standings on 37 points. Playing up front for  Leeds United , Rodrigo  entertains an Everton side  who are yet to keep a clean sheet in 2022/23. \n Harry Kane (TOT) \u00a311.4m \n The  Tottenham Hotspur  forward has scored four goals and earned 24 points in his last three matches. Kane was successful in his previous meeting with  West Ham United , claiming 13 points in a  3-1 win . \n Gabriel Jesus (ARS) \u00a38.2m \n Arsenal\u2019s Brazilian is among the top armband contenders at home to Villa. Jesus\u2019 14 shots in the box and seven chances created both place in the top three among forwards this season. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 GW5 Ones to watch: Kane backed to extend goal streak Part 2:\u00a0 GW5 Differentials: Eze can unlock Brentford defence Part 4:  GW5 Captains: Back De Bruyne over Haaland Part 5:  Who to captain in GW5?

Sa can collect more returns  against a Nottingham Forest side  who have scored just one goal in four road trips. \n Eric Dier (TOT) \u00a35.2m \n His impact at both ends of the pitch has helped Spurs\u2019 centre-back into fourth place in the defender standings on 39 points.

The experts give their verdicts on the best picks ahead of the Double Gameweek 20  deadline of 18:30 GMT on Friday 13 January . \n Pranil Sheth ( @lateriser12 ) \n Why not play the chip in Gameweek 20? \u00a0Haaland  is clearly the best option despite the fixtures looking tough on paper. Both Man Utd and Spurs have been conceding chances.\u00a0 \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Double Gameweeks are always a good opportunity to play the Triple Captain chip. Most FPL managers will want to hand the armband to  Haaland.  However the fixtures against Man Utd and Spurs may not be the most appealing, although their must-win nature may strengthen the likelihood of him playing 90 minutes in both.  \n I will hold the chip for a more attractive set of Double Gameweek fixtures. However, if I were playing it this week I would give it to  Rashford  over Haaland, who has the form along with a great second fixture against Palace.  \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n Haaland 's minutes are as secure as they are ever going to be in this Double due to the calibre of Man City's opposition. In reality, the Norwegian can go big against anyone. He's a great Triple Captain option with rotation more of a concern as the season goes on. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n I'm not considering the Triple Captain this week. As good as  Haaland  is, I think there will be a better opportunity later in the season to use it, with either two more attractive fixtures for Haaland or another player with two great matches. \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n There are a lot of reasons to play the Triple Captain chip on \u00a0Haaland  this Gameweek. He is off the back of a World Cup break, is injury-free and also got a full rest in FA Cup third round.  \n Add to that the fact that outside of Gameweek 20 and Gameweek 23, other potential Double Gameweek windows will come around the Champions League stages. \n They could also present conflicting chip usage such as a Wildcard in Gameweek 29 and Bench Boost in Gameweek 34. Furthermore, \"harder\" fixtures also mean higher expected minutes and low risk of rotation. \n Don't forget the GW20 deadline is 18:30 GMT on Friday 13 January \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 Scout Selection: Best FPL team for DGW20 Part 2:\u00a0 DGW20 Captains: Rashford and Kane can rival Haaland \n",

A repeat of his brace last season at the Etihad Stadium would take Kane to the milestone.\u00a0 \n History on Spurs' side \n The north Londoners can head to Manchester with the knowledge that they have dominated this contest over the past few seasons, winning four of their last five matches against  Man City , including both meetings last term. \n It represents a return of Spurs\u2019 supremacy over the Citizens between 2004 and 2010, when they triumphed in all but one of 13 meetings in all competitions. \n However, City have won this encounter convincingly on several occasions, most notably earning a  6-0 home win in November 2013 . \n Defensive frailties \n Both sides have been struggling at the back this season.\u00a0Spurs have only secured one clean sheet in their last nine outings,\u00a0a  4-0 win against Crystal Palace . \n Indeed, in the eight matches when they have conceded,  Antonio Conte 's side have let in two or more goals, taking only seven points from those outings.\u00a0 \n Meanwhile, Man City have only one clean sheet in their last six matches. \n Their frailties at the back could make this another brilliant encounter, and history suggests there will be goals.\u00a0The last goalless draw between the two teams was back in August 2010. \n Return of key personnel \n Both teams are set to be boosted by the return of key players.\u00a0 \n John Stones  has missed City's last two matches in all competitions, while  Ruben Dias  hasn't featured since being injured for Portugal at the World Cup. But Guardiola has confirmed both are in contention for this match. \n \"In the last two training sessions they have trained really well and they are in contention,\" he said on the  club's official website .\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n Rodrigo Bentancur  was also injured at the World Cup and hasn't played since. But Conte has issued a positive statement on the defensive midfielder. \n \"He is available and he could be available for the game against City,\" Conte said on the  club's official website . \n Guardiola v Conte \n A key factor for Spurs could be Conte's excellent record against Guardiola.\u00a0The Italian has won three of their last five meetings in all competitions. \n Among the managers Guardiola has faced at least five times in his career, Conte is the only one he's lost more than half his matches against. \n City can put the pressure on \n If Man City want to claim a third straight league title, they have a lot of work to do to catch Arsenal. \n However, by the time the Gunners  kick off against Manchester United  this weekend, the landscape at the top of the table could look very different. \n Should Man City win tonight, and then  at home against Wolverhampton Wanderers  at 14:00 GMT on Sunday, they would move within two points of Arsenal before the leaders start their match at 16:30 GMT. \n \n \n \n The top five \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Position \n Pos \n \n Club \n \n Played \n Pl \n \n GD \n \n Points \n Pts \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Manchester City \n MCI \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +61\n\n \n 89 \n \n \n \n 2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Arsenal \n ARS \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +45\n\n \n 84 \n \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Manchester United \n MUN \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +15\n\n \n 75 \n \n \n \n 4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Newcastle United \n NEW \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +35\n\n \n 71 \n \n \n \n 5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Liverpool \n LIV \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +28\n\n \n 67 \n \n \n \n \n \n View More \n \n \n",

        "text": "\n Having failed to find the back of the net in any of his last three fixtures, questions are beginning to be raised as to whether it is time to change  Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.2m) as the captain in  Fantasy Premier League . \n \n \n \n \n \n MUN \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 1 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 2 \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Haaland could yet banish that run in Gameweek 20, with  Manchester City  looking to get back to winning ways when they welcome  Tottenham Hotspur . \n But given the form of other assets in Fantasy, such as  Marcus Rashford  (\u00a37.1m),  Bukayo Saka  (\u00a38.1m) and  Martin Odegaard  (\u00a36.8m), it might now be time to consider other options for the armband.\u00a0 \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n I haven't captained \u00a0Haaland  in Gameweek 20, deciding instead to give the armband to  Rashford . While I still think Haaland should be considered for the captaincy on a weekly basis, I don't think it is as cut and dried as it once was. Plus there are other assets who maybe have a better fixture. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Haaland  remains the highest-scoring player in the game as well as being the player who has scored the most goals.  \n However, Man City aren't playing at quite the same level they were at the start of the season, whereas teams like Arsenal and Man Utd have found their rhythm.  \n In some Gameweeks Haaland will be the best captaincy option, but don't be afraid to move the armband elsewhere to a player like  Saka ,  Odegaard  or  Rashford  if they have better form and/or fixtures.\u00a0 \n Pranil Sheth ( @lateriser12 ) \n I still think  Haaland  is the best captaincy option especially in Gameweek 21 where  Liverpool  play  Chelsea  and  Arsenal  play  Manchester United . Man City need the points and they can't afford to rest their main players at the moment. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n Haaland  remains the go-to captain option in my opinion. He's the focal point of one of the league's best attacks and has hat-trick potential in any match. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n Haaland  will be my captain, but I also like  Kevin De Bruyne  (\u00a312.5m) for some Man City matches. When the fixtures are right, I'd also have no issue captaining \u00a0Rashford ,  Saka  or even  Kieran Trippier\u00a0 (\u00a36.0m). \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n I can't see myself deviating from  Haaland  any time soon. Despite a dip in his underlying numbers and Man City's form, he still looks the best option. Hopefully, this is just a blip and things improve soon. \n Nick Harris ( @WGTA_Nick ) \n It has only been a couple of matches that \u00a0Haaland  has blanked. He still has a ridiculous haul of goals at the halfway point of the season and will likely be my captain pick.  \n Harry Kane  (\u00a311.6m) or  Rashford  on current form would be potential backup options if the fixtures are particularly kind. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n Man City are pretty reliable at home, where \u00a0Haaland  has the potential to produce big hauls, so I still think most will look to captain him against  Wolverhampton Wanderers  this weekend.  \n While Spurs have been inconsistent of late,  Kane  has looked sharp. He's been good away from home this season and  Fulham  will concede chances. Don't rule out captaining other players though, as they could bring fruitful rewards.\u00a0 \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n In a single Gameweek when \u00a0Haaland  is likely to start, he is still the captain choice regardless of Man City's form, in my opinion.  However, with doubles coming, various other options will emerge. That could be  Saka ,  Rashford ,\u00a0 Mohamed Salah  (\u00a312.8m),  Kane  or even  Trippier . \n",

Almost every other player is assigned to man-marking duties. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Before a kick has been taken the Gunners tend to stand in a horizontal line to avoid possible clusters. \n From there, they will follow their markers accordingly, while the zonal players remain fixated on defending the space. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Most Premier League clubs choose to use a mixture of zonal and man-to-man marking, with very few opting to deploy just a couple of players marking space. \n Nottingham Forest  are one of those teams who prefer to man-mark, and that set-up has caused them a few problems this season. \n Opponents tend to try and create additional chaos up against man-marking sides, and the use of blockers is especially prevalent in those scenarios. \n Falling victim to that type of situation on more than one occasion,  Steve Cooper \u2019s side have conceded five times from corners. \n Most goals conceded from corners 2022/23 \n \n \n \n Team \n Goals conceded \n \n \n \n \n AFC Bournemouth \n 9 \n \n \n Brentford \n 7 \n \n \n Nott'm Forest \n 5 \n \n \n Chelsea \n 5 \n \n \n \n AFC Bournemouth  have the weakest record when it comes to defending corner kicks, shipping nine goals. \n They also go heavy on man-marking, usually with at least six defenders asked to get tight to their opposite numbers, with the others taking up zonal positions. \n Problematically, they have lost a number of key aerial duels inside the penalty box. \n Below is an example of their defensive structure at  Fulham , prior to  Issa Diop  (circled) getting a run on  Marcos Senesi  to score in the  2-2 draw . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n It feels as though zonal marking is very much in vogue with the bulk of Premier League managers and set-piece coach specialists. \n With the division on course for a record-high number of goals from corners, it will be fascinating to see if they find new ways to keep attacking sides at bay when the Premier League resumes on Boxing Day. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Why goals from corners are heading for a record high Part 2:  How Spurs free Kane to score from corners Part 3:  How Fulham use blockers to capitalise from corners Part 4:  How Man City use short corners to feed Haaland Part 5:  Why Liverpool are the kings of the outswinging corner Part 6:  Why Arsenal are a nightmare for goalkeepers from corners \n",

Despite playing only one match, away to Chelsea, Haaland\u2019s huge 84 per cent ownership means he is very likely to remain the top captaincy pick. \n Harry Kane (TOT) \u00a311.6m \n The Spurs star has a prolific record  against his hosts Crystal Palace , totalling 45 points in his previous five thanks to five goals and two assists. Away from home in 2022/23, Kane's total of 30 shots is more than any other player. \n Aleksandar Mitrovic (FUL) \u00a37.1m \n Fulham\u2019s forward looks set to be Haaland\u2019s main rival for the captaincy due to his DGW. When considering the armband, Mitrovic\u2019s owners should be aware he is one booking away from a single-match ban. If he is cautioned against Leicester, he would then miss the second fixture of his Double, at home to Chelsea.\u00a0 \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  DGW19 Ones to watch Part 2:  DGW19 Differentials Part 4:  DGW19 Captains \n",

        "text": "\n With three fixtures missing from the original Gameweek 8 schedule there is a good opportunity for FPL managers to play the Free Hit chip. \n Doing this means managers can field a full team with the best picks from the fixtures. \n Sam Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) has shared her thoughts on a Free Hit team for Gameweek 8.\u00a0 \n Nick Pope (NEW) \u00a35.1m \n Pope was the highest-scoring goalkeeper in Gameweek 6 registering 12 points. He has made 28 saves so far, more than any other Premier League shot-stopper. \n Joao Cancelo (MCI) \u00a37.1m \n Cancelo has received more passes in the final third than any other defender in the game this season. Only Kevin De Bruyne (\u00a312.2m) and Phil Foden (\u00a38.0m) have supplied more crosses this season for  Man City , so more attacking returns look likely.\u00a0 \n Kieran Trippier (NEW) \u00a35.3m \n Trippier is the most transferred-in player ahead of the Gameweek 8 deadline. He has had over 167,000 transfers in so far. He has also taken more free-kicks and corners than any other defender, increasing his potential route to points.\u00a0 \n Emerson Royal (TOT) \u00a35.1m \n Royal has played 90 minutes for  Spurs  in each of their last four Premier League matches.  Spurs play Leicester City  in Gameweek 8 and they have the third-lowest expected goals (xG) tally in the league.\u00a0 \n Gabriel Martinelli (ARS) \u00a36.5m \n Martinelli has returned in four of  Arsenal \u2019s opening fixtures of the season. He is first for threat in the ICT index amongst midfielders in the game.\u00a0 \n James Ward-Prowse (SOU) \u00a36.5m \n Ward-Prowse  faces Aston Villa  in Gameweek 8. Villa have conceded 27 attempts from set-pieces so far this season; only five teams have conceded more. Ward-Prowse takes all of Southampton\u2019s set-pieces and so could thrive in Gameweek 8.\u00a0 \n Kevin De Bruyne (MCI) \u00a312.2m \n With no fixture for Mohamed Salah (\u00a312.9m) there is a good opportunity for managers playing the Free Hit chip to own players like De Bruyne. The City midfielder has created 20 chances for his team-mates so far this season, and only Erling Haaland (\u00a312.0m) has had more attempts on goal in the Man City squad.\u00a0 \n Andreas Pereira (FUL) \u00a34.6m \n Owned by 27 per cent of managers, Pereira often finds himself on FPL managers' benches. However,  Pereira visits Nottingham Forest , who have conceded 14 goals this season. Only Leicester and  AFC Bournemouth  have let in more.\u00a0 \n Erling Haaland (MCI) \u00a312.0m \n Haaland has returned in every Premier League game he has played in so far this season. He has also overtaken Gabriel Jesus (\u00a38.1m) to become the highest-owned player in the game and is the top points scorer so far. Even when playing a Free Hit, Haaland remains a must-have.\u00a0 \n Harry Kane (TOT) \u00a311.4m \n Kane's biggest FPL return came against Gameweek 8 opponents Leicester in the 2016/17 season, when he registered 24 points. Kane averages nine points per match against the Foxes and is in good form with returns in five of the opening six matches of the season.\u00a0 \n Aleksandar Mitrovic (FUL) \u00a36.9m \n With his current form, Mitrovic is a must-have this weekend. He has returned four goals against  Nottingham Forest  in his career, including two in the Championship last season. Mitrovic has only failed to return in one match this campaign.\u00a0 \n Bench \n Danny Ward (\u00a34.0m), Neco Williams (\u00a34.1m), Nathan Patterson (\u00a34.1m), Leon Bailey (\u00a34.7m) Total:  \u00a399.1m \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Gameweek 8: What FPL managers need to know Part 2:  How to approach reduced Gameweek 8 Part 3:\u00a0 GW8 Ones to watch: Mitrovic to continue goal run Part 4:  GW8 Differentials: Isak has schedule to thrive Part 6:  FPL experts: What's the best chip for reduced GW8?

He has started 13 of his side's 14 matches, while Foden has appeared off the bench in three of their last four. \n The Man City playmaker sits just three points off the top of the midfield standings on 90 points and has been involved in 13 goals, more than any other player in his position.\u00a0 \n De Bruyne has already amassed 10 assists, more than his total of eight from last term. \n And with Haaland leading the line, FPL managers could be richly rewarded for doubling up on Pep Guardiola's favoured big-hitters. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Double up with Ward and Iversen Part 2:  Dalot heads value budget defenders Part 3:  In-form Robertson back to his best Part 4:  Rodrigo rivalling Haaland for goals Part 6:  Ings can continue to deliver for Emery Part 7:  Darwin can evolve for successful season \n \u00a0 \n",

James scored in his last home match, a  2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur in Gameweek 2 . \n Ben Mee (BRE) \u00a34.6m \n The centre-back is another Brentford player who will trouble Everton at set-pieces. Mee scored a headed goal and produced 14 points in the Bees\u2019 last home outing, a  4-0 win over Manchester United in Gameweek 2 . \n Mohamed Salah (LIV) \u00a313.0m \n Liverpool\u2019s Egyptian has a formidable record against promoted sides, producing double-figure hauls in five of his last seven such appearances.  AFC Bournemouth , meanwhile, have conceded at least three goals in each of their last two matches. \n Gabriel Martinelli (ARS) \u00a36.4m \n The winger has been  Arsenal \u2019s most consistent player this season, producing returns in each of the first three Gameweeks. Martinelli has soared to 41 per cent ownership ahead of the  Gunners\u2019 home encounter with Fulham . \n Rodrigo (LEE) \u00a36.3m \n Playing as a forward for  Leeds United  but classified as a midfielder in Fantasy, the Spaniard is the top-scoring player in FPL thanks to four goals and an assist.

Despite having no returns against AFC Bournemouth, his underlying data was better than Haaland's last weekend, which suggests goals are coming.

I'll be going with  Salah , who will come out all guns blazing due to his flop against AFC Bournemouth.\u00a0 \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n With concerns around minutes for Haaland this midweek, I'm going to play it safe with  Jesus  who has the home form against a struggling Aston Villa side.\u00a0 \n Nick\u00a0 ( @WGTA_Nick )\u00a0\u00a0 \n Haaland  is my pick for the armband in the midweek matches.

Cancelo boasts a significant goal threat  against West Ham United . His total of 81 shots in 2021/22 was more than any team-mate. \n Reece James (CHE) \u00a36.0m \n Chelsea's wing-back travels to Everton  on the back of some outstanding away form last term.

        "text": "\n The Scout's panel of  Fantasy Premier League  experts share their thoughts on the players they are looking to transfer in for Double Gameweek 20 ahead of  Friday's 18:30 GMT deadline . \n Lee Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n I loved the way  Son Heung-min  (\u00a311.6m) ripped off his mask when he celebrated his goal in the  4-0 win at Crystal Palace , relieved to have finally ended his goalscoring drought. Could this be a turning point for the South Korean? \n We know his FPL potential, especially playing two teams in DGW20 that will attack and go for the points - potentially leaving space for Son on the counter-attack. Owned by only six per cent of managers, he could be a season-changer if you're falling behind in your mini-leagues.  \n Likewise, with  Manchester United  also playing twice,\u00a0 Bruno Fernandes  (\u00a39.8m) could offer managers a good differential. \n \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 2 \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n CRY \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 1 \n \n MUN \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 2 \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n CHE \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 0 \n \n CRY \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n MUN \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 1 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Ben Crabtree\u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n Harry Kane  (\u00a311.6m) and  Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.2m) \u00a0 look the two safest picks and will battle it out for captaincy.  Kevin De Bruyne  (\u00a312.5m) feels like he is due a big return, so I'd prioritise him in third.  \n After that, it's more punts and players who may not play much more than 90 minutes across the two matches.  Jack Grealish  (\u00a36.8m) could finally be an option if he recovers from illness. \n Some managers may find it suits them better to look at  John Stones  (\u00a35.4m),  Rico Lewis  (\u00a33.9m) or hoping for an attacking return from  Ivan Perisic  (\u00a35.5m) or  Matt Doherty  (\u00a34.6m). \n See:\u00a0 Man Utd given Double Gameweek 20 in FPL \n Sam Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n I was already invested in  Kane ,  Joao Cancelo  (\u00a37.3m) and \u00a0Haaland  ahead of the DGW20. With the announcement that Man Utd and  Crystal Palace  will also play twice, I now also have  Luke Shaw  (\u00a35.1m)\u00a0and  Marcus Rashford  (\u00a37.0m) \u00a0 with two fixtures. \n There are a couple of other players that I am thinking about investing in ahead of Friday's deadline. Selecting a  Manchester City  midfielder always comes as a risk due to Pep Guardiola's constant shuffling of his pack. But if you can afford him,  De Bruyne  is probably the safest option, particularly after a rest in the FA Cup.  \n I would also look at the likes of  Grealish \u00a0or  Riyad Mahrez  (\u00a37.5m), knowing they may only start in one of the fixtures. Grealish missed the FA Cup entirely through illness and therefore should be available for DGW20. Mahrez's minutes are more concerning given he played the full 90 minutes versus  Chelsea  in the cup but his form could make the risk worthwhile.  \n I am also considering tripling up on Man Utd as the in-form team right now. Adding  Fernandes  to Shaw and Rashford should be the perfect combination, especially given Palace's shaky defence. If you own  Wilfried Zaha  (\u00a37.3m) then hold for the Double, although I wouldn't prioritise investing in Palace based on their recent form. \n Pranil Sheth ( @Lateriser12 )\u00a0 \n Given that Man City quickly have a second Double in Gameweek 23, getting the right three from that team is pivotal.  De Bruyne ,  Haaland \u00a0and one of  Stones \u00a0or \u00a0Mahrez \u00a0are the players I would consider.  \n Man Utd have a good run of fixtures after the Double Gameweek too, so  Rashford \u00a0and  Shaw \u00a0are a must. \n Nick\u00a0 ( @WGTA_Nick )\u00a0 \n The one key man at  Tottenham Hotspur  for DGW20 is \u00a0Kane  and despite a middling season for the club, he is on track for his best-ever points haul in Fantasy, with 127 points after 18 matches.  \n There has been heavy rotation at Man City recently, meaning many of the popular players such as\u00a0 Phil Foden  (\u00a38.2m) and \u00a0Cancelo  may not play both matches. But  De Bruyne  is the one who is key for Pep in midfield and one that is likely to find his form again sooner rather than later.  \n From Man Utd,  Rashford  is in incredible form and looks essential at his price point. Otherwise, the likes of \u00a0Shaw ,  Diogo Dalot  (\u00a34.7m),  Fernandes  and  Anthony Martial  (\u00a36.6m) could all be interesting picks.  \n I'm not convinced by anyone at this moment from Palace but  Eberechi Eze  (\u00a35.6m) and  Michael Olise  (\u00a35.4m) could be fun differentials to own. \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n Haaland  and  De Bruyne  are the standout attacking picks from Man City.  Mahrez 's form also makes him an exciting punt. In defence, it is hard to make a case for anyone given the recent benchings for  Cancelo . I am still hoping he comes through as the the go-to third asset to own. Otherwise,\u00a0 Stones  has looked assured and has started the majority of matches since the season resumed.  Ederson \u00a0(\u00a35.4m) is the other, albeit low upside option.  \n From Spurs, despite the resurgence of  Son ,\u00a0 Perisic  and  Doherty  versus Palace, I would still only look at \u00a0Kane  if you can get get to him easily given the unfavourable fixtures.\u00a0 \n I'd rate  Rashford  the highest in terms of priority from Man Utd given his scintillating form.  Fernandes ,  Antony  (\u00a37.4m) and  Martial  are all decent options, but alongside, not instead of Rashford.  \n In defence, \u00a0Shaw  and  Dalot  should both be assured of starts and are good options. Dalot may be better for bonus points given his pass completion and tackles, but Shaw could provide more attacking returns given he plays further forward and is on set-pieces. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n I think getting the right Man City players in place is key given they have another Double in Gameweek 23. For me, \u00a0De Bruyne  should be top of the list. Spurs investment is optional due to their DGW20 being less favourable.\u00a0 \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n While our focus should still be on the most explosive team in the league, Man City,\u00a0 Kane ,  Shaw  and  Rashford  are all playing so well at the moment that if you don't own them, I would consider taking a hit to get the trio in your team. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 DGW20 Scout Selection Part 2:\u00a0 DGW20 Captains: Rashford and Kane can rival Haaland Part 3:  Time to Triple Captain Haaland in DGW20? \n",

However, I will have an exit plan thereafter, particularly in the case of Mount. \n Chelsea's next four Gameweeks \n \n \n \n GW \n Opp. \n FDR* \n \n \n \n \n 17 \n BOU (H) \n 2 \n \n \n 18 \n NFO (A) \n 2 \n \n \n 19 \n MCI (H), FUL (A) \n 5, 2 \n \n \n 20 \n CRY (H) \n 2 \n \n \n \n * Fixture Difficulty Rating \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n If you're an FPL manager that plays the fixtures, you have to look at Chelsea.  James , \u00a0Mount  and \u00a0Arrizabalaga  all deserve our consideration, while  Lewis Hall  (\u00a34.5m)\u00a0could become an exciting option at left wing-back for Graham Potter. \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n Chelsea players are fool's gold, for me. I'm not getting drawn in by favourable fixtures and a Double as we don't know who the starters are. I'm prepared to take a risk on  Arrizabalaga , knowing I've got  Danny Ward  (\u00a34.1m) to deputise if needed. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n At his price, it's hard to look past  Arrizabalaga  as the value-for-money pick between the sticks.  Elsewhere, it's more difficult. \u00a0 \n James  has looked ready to go in some of the friendly matches I've seen over the break. I believe Potter will have been working hard on their defensive shape too, so I'd expect improvement. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n I like Chelsea's fixtures and they have players who can return, even  against Manchester City . I always like owning \u00a0James  when fit and will be looking at  Arrizabalaga ,  Marc Cucurella  (\u00a35.1m),  Raheem Sterling  (\u00a39.7m) and \u00a0Mount ,\u00a0too. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n Chelsea play all three of the promoted teams in back-to-back Gameweeks, so there is definitely reason to invest.  James  and  Arrizabalaga \u00a0are both fit and great picks, but investing in the attack is trickier, with  Mount  the only nailed option. \n Lateriser ( @lateriser12 ) \n Chelsea's fixtures in Gameweeks 17 and 18 are great. They always function better with \u00a0James  fit, which looks set to be the case. I'm happy to roll the dice on a couple of their players given the schedule. \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Chelsea have kept just four clean sheets this season, fewer than teams like  Newcastle United ,  Arsenal ,  Leicester City  and  Manchester United , whose defenders cost less. \n James ' timely return from injury makes him an attractive option as a result of his attacking threat. He registered 14 attacking returns from five goals and nine assists last season. However, in Double Gameweek 19, Chelsea face Man City and  Fulham . City's 40 goals scored so far this season is more than any other team. Meanwhile, Fulham have netted an impressive 24 times, with only six sides scoring more.  \n If you invest in James and the Chelsea defence then it should be for their attacking threat, rather than clean sheets, which don't look likely in the Double. \n See:\u00a0 Your essential FPL tips for Gameweek 17 \n",

He played every minute, kept the joint-most clean sheets, won the FIFA Golden Glove award and starred in two penalty shootouts including the final.

A shoutout too to his compatriot\u00a0 Lisandro Martinez \u00a0of  Manchester United . \n Raphael Varane (MUN) \n In a central defence that was regularly changed by Didier Deschamps, the France coach relied on the Man Utd centre-back, who steered his nation to back-to-back World Cup finals.\u00a0 \n Bukayo Saka (ARS) \n Aged just 21, the  Arsenal  and England winger scored three goals in four starts at his first World Cup.  Marcus Rashford  also deserves a mention, after also being brilliant for the Three Lions. \n Hakim Ziyech (CHE) \n The  Chelsea  winger played the second-most minutes at the tournament of any outfield Premier League player,\u00a0getting a goal and an assist in Morocco's historic run. \n Bruno Fernandes (MUN) \n Man Utd's Portuguese star ended the tournament with the joint-most assists, setting up three goals in only four appearances. Having also scored two goals, only Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe beat his five overall goal involvements.\u00a0 \n Mateo Kovacic (CHE) \n He played the most minutes of any outfield Premier League player at the World Cup, helping Croatia - a country with a population of less than four million - finish third. An honourable mention goes to  Casemiro , too, who was superb for Brazil. \n Ivan Perisic (TOT) \n An assist in the third-place\u00a0play-off\u00a0helped Perisic move level with Fernandes on three for the most in the tournament. His goal in the last 16 was the 10th World Cup goal of his career, breaking Davor Suker's Croatian national record. \n Alexis Mac Allister (BHA) \n What a tournament for  Brighton & Hove Albion 's 23-year-old. He emerged as a key player for Argentina and produced a wonderful assist in the final.\u00a0 \n Julian Alvarez (MCI) \n Manchester City 's striker was the third-highest scorer in the tournament, scoring four times for champions Argentina at just 22 years of age. \n",

He has returned in each of his last three Premier League matches and is first amongst midfielders for creativity in the ICT index. He has averaged 6.4 points per match against Southampton and has returned in four of his last five meetings with them. \n Lee Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n Man City at home to Southampton this weekend is the standout fixture of the week. Both  De Bruyne  and  Phil Foden  (\u00a38.1m) look like great picks. \n However,  Jack Grealish  (\u00a36.8m) is arguably playing some of the best football of his career at the moment. He was unlucky not to return in Gameweek 8 and his second-biggest FPL haul came against Southampton in 2021/22 Fantasy, when he registered a goal, two assists and two bonus, totalling 15 points. I think he could be this week's top-scoring player outside of Haaland. \n Ben Crabtree\u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n I think  Chelsea  will win comfortably  against Wolverhampton Wanderers , with  Raheem Sterling  (\u00a310.0m) being among the goals. I fancy him for two returns this Gameweek. \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n I'm tipping  Foden  to have a big weekend after his night off in Europe this midweek. He has the form linking up with Haaland and opponents Southampton are yet to keep a clean sheet this season. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n I'm sticking with the Haaland fixture and will be looking at  De Bruyne  to go big after his rest. \n Pras ( @Pras_fpl ) \n I reckon  Wilfried Zaha  (\u00a37.3m) will haul  against Leeds United \u00a0on Sunday.  Crystal Palace  look a great attacking side, who were unlucky to lose to Chelsea last week. \n Zaha is the focal point of the attack, on penalties and therefore my tip for the highest points scorer in Gameweek 10. \n See:\u00a0 Your essential FPL tips for Gameweek 10 \n GW10 deadline: 13:30 BST, Sat 8 Oct \n",

        "text": "\n After the release of the 2022/23 fixtures, The Scout picks out five defenders with promising early schedules who should be considered for opening  Fantasy Premier League  squads. \n Marc Cucurella (BHA) \n Brighton & Hove Albion\u2019 s wing-back offers many routes to returns over a very kind opening run of opponents. \n The Seagulls face just one of last season's top-six sides in their first eight matches, away to  Manchester United  in Gameweek 1. \n Cucurella combined a goal and an assist with 11 clean sheets and 21 bonus over his 35 appearances last term, his total of 126 points at least 31 more than any defensive team-mate. \n The underlying numbers further highlight his creative potential. \n From the point of his debut in Gameweek 4, Cucurella's 42 key passes were bettered by only four other defenders in Fantasy. \n Trent Alexander-Arnold (LIV) \n Last season's top-scoring defender has the schedule to immediately reward investors. \n Liverpool  face just one of the top six sides from 2021/22 in their opening seven matches, away to Man Utd in Gameweek 3. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n That gives Alexander-Arnold the chance to find the form that produced two goals, 12 assists, 18 clean sheets and 32 bonus in the previous campaign. \n His ability to deliver huge hauls in Fantasy will make him a key figure in many managers' backlines, his eight double-figure hauls at least two more than any other defender in Fantasy last term. \n Joao Cancelo (MCI) \n Manchester City 's kind run of opponents looks encouraging for the Portuguese to get off to another fast start.\u00a0 \n The champions are the only side to avoid all of last season's top six in their first six fixtures.\u00a0 \n Cancelo was the top-scoring defender in the opening six Gameweeks last term, amassing 44 points thanks to two assists and five clean sheets. \n That set the tone for the campaign, with the 28-year-old ending as the fifth top-scoring player overall on 201 points.\u00a0 \n Cancelo's total of 81 shots was at least 30 more than any other defender in 2021/22, also bettering all of his Man City team-mates. \n Jonny (WOL) \n The wing-back could emerge as the best route into a  Wolverhampton Wanderers  defence that claimed 11 clean sheets last term. \n Jonny also impressed in attack after returning from long-term injury, scoring twice in 10 starts. \n Bruno Lage's men have three favourable home matches with  Fulham ,  Newcastle United  and  Southampton  in the opening six Gameweeks, as well as trips to  Leeds United  and  AFC Bournemouth . \n Ben Chilwell (CHE) \n Chelsea 's left wing-back made a huge impression at both ends of the pitch last term, before being sidelined through injury. \n Chilwell amassed 54 points in a run of six starts, combining three goals and an assist with four clean sheets. \n That all-round potential could make him the go-to Blues defender in 2022/23 Fantasy, particularly if Reece James continues to be used as a centre-back on occasion.\u00a0 \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Pair up Salah and Haaland for captaincy Part 3:  Son among best early armband picks Part 4:  Vardy can make fast start \n",

Trippier has delivered returns in seven successive outings, amassing 67 points thanks to three assists, seven clean sheets and 18 bonus points. \n Serge Aurier (NFO) \u00a34.5m \n The  Nottingham Forest  full-back has blanked only three times and collected 48 points in his last nine appearances. Aurier  faces an AFC Bournemouth side  who have failed to score in all four of their matches since domestic action resumed. \n Ben Mee (BRE) \u00a34.7m \n Brentford 's centre-back boasts strong potential at both ends of the pitch  against Leeds United . Mee has combined two goals and an assist with six clean sheets this season. \n Kevin De Bruyne (MCI) \u00a312.5m \n The Belgian's prolific record against  Wolves  suggests he could outscore Haaland. De Bruyne has four goals, two assists and 34 points in his last two meetings with them. \n Marcus Rashford (MUN) \u00a37.1m \n The England star has been  Manchester United 's standout player since the resumption of domestic action, scoring in seven of their eight matches in all competitions. Rashford delivered his season-high haul of 18 points against  Arsenal  in Gameweek 6, thanks to two goals and an assist. \n Martin Odegaard (ARS) \u00a36.8m \n Arsenal's playmaker has soared to the top of the midfield standings on the back of eight goals and five assists. The absence of  Casemiro  (\u00a34.9m) for Man Utd  through suspension  could prove decisive for the Gunners, further lifting Odegaard\u2019s chances of more returns. \n Kaoru Mitoma (BHA) \u00a35.0m \n His 10 shots in the box and five big chances both place second among midfielders over the last four Gameweeks. \n Erling Haaland (MCI) \u00a312.2m \n An ownership of 85 per cent means  Man City 's forward will retain his role as the runaway captain favourite. Haaland hosts a Wolves side who have managed a single clean sheet on their travels this term. \n Harry Kane (TOT) \u00a311.7m \n Tottenham Hotspur 's talisman scored and earned nine points against  Fulham  in Gameweek 6.

\u00a0 \n The manner of Manchester City\u2019s  2-1 defeat to neighbours Man Utd  highlighted concerns at both ends of the pitch for  Pep Guardiola \u2019s side.\u00a0 \n Jack Grealish \u2019s goal was  Man City \u2019s only shot on target, while  Erling Haaland  has now failed to score in three consecutive appearances in all competitions for the first time since joining the club last summer.\u00a0 \n There are also issues in defence, with two goals having been conceded in each of their last two matches in all competitions.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 2 \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n John Stones  missed both of those contests due to injury, so Guardiola will be desperate for the centre-back to be available again for Thursday\u2019s home meeting with Spurs.\u00a0 \n Man Utd exploited the City defence on the counter-attack, and that is something  Antonio Conte  will hope to replicate, just as his side did in last season\u2019s  3-2 win at the Etihad Stadium .\u00a0 \n Isak can make the difference\u00a0 \u00a0 \n Heading towards a third successive goalless draw, the returning  Aleksander Isak  provided the inspiration  Newcastle United  needed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \n The Sweden international, making his first Premier League appearance since September, combined with  Callum Wilson  to break  Fulham \u2019s resistance. \u00a0 \n It was the first time the pair have been on the pitch at the same time in the league, and it could be a partnership that helps the Magpies improve in attack \u2013 their total of 33 goals has been bettered by five other teams.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \n Newcastle did ride their luck on their way to a league-high 11 th  clean sheet, with  Aleksandar Mitrovic \u2019s penalty ruled out after he  accidentally hit the ball twice. \u00a0 \n Despite  Sean Longstaff  ably deputising for the injured  Bruno Guimaraes  in the second half,  Eddie Howe  will know he needs the Brazilian star fit for his side to maintain their top-four push. \u00a0 \n Seagulls adding goals under De Zerbi \u00a0 \n Brighton & Hove Albion \u2019s stunning  3-0 victory over Liverpool  helped the Seagulls leapfrog their opponents up to seventh and was the perfect example of how they have evolved under head coach  Roberto De Zerbi . \u00a0 \n Since the Italian was appointed as  Graham Potter \u2019s successor, only Arsenal and Newcastle, with 25 goals,\u00a0 have \u00a0found the back of the net more often than Brighton (24). \u00a0 \n \n \n The best seat in the house! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83c\udf7f \n\u2014 Brighton & Hove Albion (@OfficialBHAFC)  January 16, 2023 \n \n Potter\u2019s Brighton won many plaudits for the way they played out from the back and were able to move the ball through the thirds, but the finishing touch often eluded his side. \u00a0 \n But in handing starting roles to  Kaoru Mitoma  and more recently youngster  Evan Ferguson , along with pushing  Solly March  further forward, De Zerbi looks to have resolved those issues. \u00a0 \n Could European qualification be on the cards for Brighton? \u00a0 \n Ward-Prowse revels in advanced role \u00a0 \n In what was a crucial match at the bottom of the table,  James Ward-Prowse  provided two defining moments in the  2-1 victory at Everton  that moved  Southampton  to  within a  point of safety and earned manager  Nathan Jones  a first Premier League win. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n SOU \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 1 \n \n AVL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Often used in a more deep-lying midfield role this season, Ward-Prowse was pushed forward into a No 10 role at Goodison Park. \u00a0 \n The Southampton captain\u2019s anticipation and quick feet to produce the equaliser against  Everton  highlighted the quality he can deliver in the final third if he is used in a more advanced position. \u00a0 \n On the back of three consecutive victories in all competitions, Saints will hope to extend their unbeaten run at home to  Aston Villa  on Saturday, with Ward-Prowse and Jones showing signs they can lead Southampton to safety. \u00a0 \n",

There are three standout areas to work on. \n Set-piece goals \n Since the start of last season, the Foxes have conceded 24 set-piece goals, with 19 of those coming from corners, the worst return of all Premier League clubs. \n Goals let in from corners since Aug '21 \n \n \n \n Team \n Goals conceded \n \n \n \n \n Leicester \n 19 \n \n \n Everton \n 17 \n \n \n Southampton \n 15 \n \n \n Brentford \n 14 \n \n \n \n So far in 2022/23, they have leaked five goals from set-plays. Of these, three have been conceded from corners, one from a long throw and another from a direct free-kick. \n Rodgers likes to set his team up with a mix of zonal defenders along the six-yard box and man-to-man markers elsewhere in the penalty area. \n But his players have lacked physicality and awareness, and struggled with marking. \n Opponents have sensed this weakness, often crowding the six-yard box to apply additional pressure. \n Leicester\u2019s Achilles heel has been near-post deliveries from corners. These have cost them 10 goals since the start of last season. \n They will hope the arrival of set-piece coach Lars Knudsen earlier this month makes a difference. \n Leicester goals let in from corners 22/23 \n \n \n \n Type of goal \n Total \n \n \n \n \n Near post \n 10 \n \n \n Short \n 3 \n \n \n No reaction to second ball \n 3 \n \n \n Lost headed duel centre of box \n 2 \n \n \n Far post \n 1 \n \n \n \n Making possession count \n Rodgers\u2019 side have played some attractive passing football this season. \n Comfortable on the ball, they have moved it around nicely, and this was the case for long periods of their loss at  Spurs . \n In fact, Leicester have produced 107 sequences of 10 or more passes, which is second only to  Manchester City . \n Subsequently, they have made the second-highest number of successful passes in the division. \n But too much of that possession has been in the defensive and middle thirds, without penetration. \n Successful passes v threat 2022/23 \n \n \n \n Most succ. passes \n Fewest shots in opp. box \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n 4,602 \n BOU \n 29 \n \n \n LEI \n 3,202 \n LEI \n 41 \n \n \n LIV \n 3,150 \n AVL \n 41 \n \n \n ARS \n 3,097 \n WOL \n 44 \n \n \n TOT \n 2,899 \n CRY \n 46 \n \n \n \n Leicester have been taking extra touches and overcomplicating passages of play, finding it difficult to get in behind the opposition. \n AFC Bournemouth  are the only side to have had fewer touches in the opposition box, and they are also the only team to have mustered fewer shots inside the penalty area. \n Moving forward, Rodgers and his players might want to look at producing more counters or direct attacks that catch defenders off guard. \n Sharper movement ahead of the ball would also help to create better goalscoring opportunities for the likes of  Harvey Barnes ,  Jamie Vardy  and  Patson Daka . \n Toughening up the mentality\u00a0 \n Leicester have also frequently given up the lead this season. \n They scored first against  Spurs ,  Brighton & Hove Albion ,  Southampton  and  Brentford , only to collect a total of one point from those four matches. \n The Foxes have conceded too many goals in clusters. \n It is vital they change this habit of letting their confidence drop following setbacks. \n Ahead of a high-pressure encounter, there is plenty for the players and coaching staff to work on. \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout assesses the best players for managers to consider for opening  Fantasy Premier League  squads, according to price, position and early schedule. \n Ben Chilwell (CHE) \u00a36.0m \n Chilwell was a huge success at both ends of the pitch in 2021/22 before he was sidelined through injury. \n Playing as a left wing-back for  Chelsea , he combined three goals and an assist with four clean sheets and five bonus points in his six starts, amassing 55 points.\u00a0 \n Now fully recovered, Chilwell - who is owned by 11 per cent of managers - has the schedule to emerge as a major differential from the very start of the season.\u00a0 \n Chelsea face only two of last season\u2019s top six teams in their first 12 fixtures,  hosting Tottenham Hotspur \u00a0and\u00a0 Liverpool \u00a0in Gameweeks 2 and 8 respectively. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Trent Alexander-Arnold (LIV) \u00a37.5m \n The  Liverpool  right-back was the top-scoring defender in Fantasy last term, finishing third overall on 208 points. \n Alexander-Arnold was the most reliable player in his position for huge scores in 2021/22, producing eight double-digit hauls due to his many routes to returns. \n The right-back combined two goals and 12 assists with 18 clean sheets and 32 bonus points.\u00a0 \n Despite being the most expensive defender this season, Alexander-Arnold has quickly established himself as a key pick for managers. \n He is the most popular defender in the game, found in almost 55 per cent of squads.\u00a0 \n Andrew Robertson (LIV) \u00a37.0m \n Liverpool\u2019s best performer in the second half of 2021/22, Robertson bettered Alexander-Arnold by 117 points to 85 from Gameweek 20 onwards. \n Robertson averaged 6.4 points per start last term, near-identical to the 6.5 points per start of his fellow Reds full-back. \n That suggests he could prove a strong double-up option along with Alexander-Arnold for Liverpool\u2019s favourable run of opening opponents. \n Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side face only one of last season\u2019s top six sides in the first seven Gameweeks. \n Liverpool's first seven Gameweeks \n \n \n \n GW \n Opp \n FDR \n GW \n Opp \n FDR \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n FUL (A) \n 2 \n 5 \n NEW (H) \n 3 \n \n \n 2 \n CRY (H) \n 2 \n 6 \n EVE (A) \n 2 \n \n \n 3 \n MUN (A) \n 4 \n 7 \n WOL (H) \n 2 \n \n \n 4 \n BOU (H) \n 2 \n - \n \n \n \n Joao Cancelo (MCI) \u00a37.0m \n Manchester City\u2019 s Portuguese claimed second place in the defender standings last term on 201 points. \n Cancelo\u2019s one goal, 11 assists, 19 clean sheets and 27 bonus points highlight his potential as an attacking full-back for the champions. \n The underlying numbers further strengthen his appeal for early squads. \n His total of 81 shots placed top for defenders and was the highest by a Man City player in 2021/22. \n The champions also have a fine early schedule to lift Cancelo\u2019s output. Indeed, they are the only side to avoid all of last season\u2019s top six in their first six matches. \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the \u00a3100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n Reece James (CHE) \u00a36.0m \n The Chelsea\u00a0defender is among the best for producing bumper hauls in Fantasy. \n James recorded six double-digit returns in only 22 starts last term, claiming 18+ points three times.\u00a0 \n See:\u00a0 Koulibaly boosts appeal of Chelsea wing-backs \n Five goals and nine assists show his huge attacking potential playing as a right wing-back. \n As witnessed late last season, though, the versatile James may feature as a centre-back on occasion as Thomas Tuchel attempts to protect the 22-year-old from further injuries. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 The best goalkeepers Part 2:  The best budget defenders Part 4:  The best budget midfielders Part 5:  The best premium midfielders Part 6:  The best forwards \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at key tactical points and players who can be decisive in Matchweek 19. \n Chelsea \n To get their season back on track, Chelsea must quickly find a cure for their bluntness inside the final third. \n \n \n \n \n \n CHE \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 1 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n The Blues are by some distance the lowest scorers inside the Premier League\u2019s top 10, finding the back of the net just 20 times across their first 16 matches. \n Second-placed  Manchester City , who visit Stamford Bridge on Thursday evening, have notched 44 goals in the same number of matches. \n Lack of a clinical edge \n Finding a way to turn control into clear-cut chances is a matter of priority for head coach  Graham Potter . \n Averaging over 59 per cent of possession, Chelsea spend a lot of time on the ball inside the opposition half, but the bulk of their football is played out in front of rival teams. \n Too many players want the ball to feet instead of making runs in beyond their markers, and collectively they do not display enough sharp or rotational movement. \n This means they find it difficult to pull defenders out of position. \n Last time out in a  1-1 draw at Nottingham Forest  this was particularly evident during a tame second-half display. \n Chelsea's attacking stats 2022/23 \n \n \n \n Statistic \n Total \n PL rank \n \n \n \n \n Shots \n 178 \n 17th \n \n \n Expected goals \n 18.3 \n 15th \n \n \n Big chances \n 27 \n =13th \n \n \n Shots in box \n 124 \n 12th \n \n \n \n While Chelsea have played one match fewer than most teams, their attacking statistics do not make for pleasant reading. \n Firing 11 shots per match on average, creating precious few 'big chances', they rank a lowly 15th for expected goals this term. \n Their xG of 18.3 is a chasm behind the likes of Arsenal (33.32) and Man City (34.29). \n Missing Reece James \n Injuries to wing-backs  Ben Chilwell  and  Reece James  have certainly had a detrimental effect. \n James is especially influential, producing 24 crosses into the box from open play this season, the most of any Blues player, despite featuring in only half of their matches. \n They also miss the England international\u2019s pace and drive. \n Chelsea with James v without James \n \n \n \n Statistic \n With James \n Without James \n \n \n \n \n Matches \n 8 \n 8 \n \n \n Expected goals \n 11.6 \n 6.8 \n \n \n Shots \n 108 \n 70 \n \n \n Points \n 19 \n 6 \n \n \n \n When he works in tandem with  Raheem Sterling , the duo regularly get to the byline or advanced areas of the pitch with fast interchanges. \n Chelsea\u2019s record with and without James is markedly different. \n They have collected 19 of their 25 points in matches that featured the 23-year-old. \n Cesar Azpilicueta  is more accustomed to supporting the wide forward from behind or inside, than creating 2v1 overloads on the outside. \n And with  Marc Cucurella  similar in style on the other flank, Chelsea\u2019s inverted wingers are often forced infield where space is at a premium. \n Key trio \n So much of Chelsea\u2019s attacking play centres around the contributions of Sterling,  Kai Havertz  and  Mason Mount . \n Sterling creates the most chances from open play (22) but this only ranks him 14th in the division, with Mount next in line (14) in joint-57th place. \n Those three players also produce the most attempts on goal, with  Christian Pulisic  the only other player in double figures for shots in the campaign so far. \n 'Big six' clubs' players with 10+ shots \n \n \n \n Team \n Total \n \n \n \n \n Man City \n 10 \n \n \n Man Utd \n 9 \n \n \n Spurs \n 9 \n \n \n Liverpool\u00a0 \n 9 \n \n \n Arsenal \n 8 \n \n \n Chelsea \n 4 \n \n \n \n When you compare the spread of attacking threat Chelsea possess compared to their 'big six' rivals, it is clear that Potter must extract more from other members of his squad. \n Tactically they have lacked dynamism and variety, and not enough individuals are pushing themselves into positions where they can impact the game with a shot or key pass. \n The visit of Man City will sharpen minds and potentially bring the best out of Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. \n But to make a realistic push for a top-four finish, significant improvements to their fluency and creativity have to be made. \n",

However, despite being the second highest-scoring player in the game the Tottenham Hotspur talisman has yet to return an explosive FPL haul.  \n He has returned two double-digit hauls in his last three meetings with Gameweek 11 opponents Everton. He averages 7.36 points per match against the Toffees in the Premier League, so this week could be the week for a big Kane return. If it wasn't for \u00a0Haaland \u00a0I would hand Kane the captain's armband this weekend. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Aston Villa have only scored six goals so far this season and I'm fully expecting a clean sheet for the Chelsea defence.\u00a0 Reece James  (\u00a36.1m) was substituted with an injury concern in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday evening. However, if he is fit then I expect him to come back into the Chelsea team in time to face the shot-shy Villans in Gameweek 11. James also sits third-best among defenders for xGI (Expected Goal Involvement), so potential for returns at both ends of the pitch look on. \n Kelly Somers ( @KellySomers ) \n It will undoubtedly be Haaland who is the top points scorer this weekend, however  Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a38.0m) will likely be second. He plays in an Arsenal team who are full of attacking talent. They will keep creating chances and he is the perfect man to take them. This weekend he faces a Leeds side who have conceded the majority of their chances this season down the centre of the pitch where you will find Jesus.\u00a0 \n Ben Crabtree ( @FCCrab_Dogg ) \n Chelsea's  James  hasn't had a haul yet so far this season. I'm backing him to get an attacking return along with a probable clean sheet against a struggling Aston Villa this weekend, so long as he is fit after the Champions League knock.\u00a0 \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n On current form,  Kane  has the potential to post a big score at home to Everton. He's making a habit of scoring in every game he plays at the moment. Plus he's on penalties. \n Pras ( @Pras_fpl ) \n In a week where last year's top two sides play each other,  Kane  is a good shout. He is yet to blank since Gameweek 1, and looks good for another haul against Everton at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. \n Pranil Sheth\u00a0( @Lateriser12 ) \n Bukayo Saka  (\u00a37.8m) plays a Leeds side who have improved a lot. However, Arsenal's firepower might be too much for them. I expect him to be the highest-scoring player this weekend. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n No team have conceded more shots than Everton over the last six Gameweeks. In reality they have been fortunate not to concede more. I fancy  Kane  to go big this weekend and be the top points scorer.\u00a0 \n Nick ( @WGTA_Nick )\u00a0\u00a0 \n I can see the Arsenal attackers return big points hauls against Leeds this weekend.  Jesus  may well be the one who repeats his heroics from Gameweek 2 and be the top-scoring player this week.\u00a0 \n See:\u00a0 Your essential FPL tips for Gameweek 11 \n GW11 deadline: 18:30 BST, Fri 14 Oct \n",

It was Pope's sixth consecutive clean sheet and his 12th of the season, putting him three clear of  Aaron Ramsdale  in the race for the  Castrol Golden Glove . \n The point takes Newcastle to within eight points of leaders  Arsenal , but having played two matches more. \n Palace stay 12th with 24 points. \n All square at Anfield \n Earlier in the day,  Jurgen Klopp 's\u00a0 1,000th professional match as a manager ended in frustration as Liverpool were held to a goalless draw by  Chelsea \u00a0at Anfield. \n \n \n \n \n \n LIV \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 0 \n \n CHE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n The Blues thought that they had taken the lead when  Kai Havertz  scored after only four minutes, but his effort was ruled out for offside following a VAR review. \n Mykhailo Mudryk , Chelsea\u2019s record signing, impressed after coming on during the second half but  Graham Potter \u2019s side had to settle for a point that keeps them in 10th place, level on 29 points with eighth-placed Liverpool. \n Ferguson frustrates the Foxes \n There was late drama at King Power Stadium, where teenage substitute  Evan Ferguson  salvaged a point for  Brighton & Hove Albion \u00a0in an entertaining 2-2 draw at  Leicester City . \n Brighton's hopes of moving up to fifth spot were boosted on 27 minutes when  Kaoru Mitoma 's sublime curling shot put them 1-0 up, his fourth goal in six matches. \n Marc Albrighton  had been on the field for just three minutes in place of the injured  Dennis Praet  when he tucked home Leicester's equaliser before the break.\u00a0 \n The Foxes edged 2-1 ahead through  Harvey Barnes , but they were denied a first win in five matches when Ferguson met  Pervis Estupinan 's cross with two minutes remaining.

Indeed, over the last month no player, including Haaland, had bettered his total of 38 points. \n Yet Foden blanked in the Anfield defeat, his fate compounded by his having a goal ruled out for a foul by Haaland in the build-up. \n Foden owners must now make do without his services in GW12 as  Manchester City  have a Blank Gameweek. \n GW11 most transferred-in players \n \n \n \n Player \n Transferred in by ('000s) \n Pts \n \n \n \n \n Foden \n 635 \n 2 \n \n \n Trossard \n 521 \n 2 \n \n \n Trippier \n 465 \n 6 \n \n \n \n Brighton's Leandro Trossard (\u00a36.8m) was the second most-bought player as over 521,000 turned to the Belgian. \n Trossard couldn't repay that faith as he blanked for the second successive Gameweek in  the Seagulls' 2-0 defeat at Brentford . \n However, he has an excellent chance to make amends as  Robert De Zerbi's team host Nottingham Forest  in Gameweek 12.

He was handed the armband by 3.3million managers, more than three times the total of any other player.\u00a0 \n The winger\u2019s goal and assist earned those backers a 24-point armband haul against  Fulham . \n Instant impact from Haaland \n Haaland made an immediate impact on his  Manchester City  debut,\u00a0 scoring twice in the 2-0 win at West Ham United  to claim 13 points.\u00a0 \n His performance has already prompted a transfer frenzy in Fantasy. \n Haaland is the No 1 target for Gameweek 2, brought in by 641,000+ managers for his  home meeting with AFC Bournemouth . \n \n \n . @KevinDeBruyne  \ud83e\udd1d  @ErlingHaaland #ManCity   pic.twitter.com/QbSBOKozCC \n\u2014 Manchester City (@ManCity)  August 7, 2022 \n \n Over 475,000 of those were owners of  Harry Kane  (\u00a311.4m), who made the direct swap after the  Tottenham Hotspur forward blanked at home to Southampton . \n Kane and fellow premium star\u00a0 Son Heung-min  (\u00a312.0m) were overshadowed by  Dejan Kulusevski  (\u00a38.0m) in the 4-1 win. \n The Swede\u2019s goal and assist helped him to 13 points, continuing his form from the previous campaign. \n Kulusevski's strike v Southampton \n \n \n \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea The goal his performance deserved \ud83d\udd25  pic.twitter.com/Yc6eh6g9sa \n\u2014 Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial)  August 6, 2022 \n \n Since making his debut in Gameweek 25 last season, Kulusevski has supplied 10 assists in Fantasy, more than any other player. \n His performance strengthens his claim as the go-to \u00a38.0m midfielder, providing a value alternative to Son or Kane in the Spurs attack. \n Strong start from Nunez \n Elsewhere,  Darwin Nunez  (\u00a39.0m) could be set to offer managers a double-up option in Liverpool\u2019s attack after his display against Fulham. \n The Uruguayan emerged from the bench to deliver a goal, an assist and nine points on his debut.\u00a0 \n Nunez has now scored in each of his last two outings as a substitute and appears likely to start  at home to Crystal Palace \u00a0in Gameweek 2. \n Pairing Salah with Nunez in attack looks a tempting alternative to doubling up on the Reds\u2019 defence after they conceded twice at Craven Cottage. \n Also in this series\u00a0 \n Part 1:\u00a0 GW1 Bonus points: Haaland steals the show Part 2:  GW1 FPL stats: Salah gives backers another strong start Part 3:  Saturday review: Kulusevski among most-bought players Part 5:\u00a0 FPL experts' lessons: Make the switch from Kane to Haaland Part 6:  FPL experts' lessons: Look to Nunez and Kulusevski for value \n",

He's a 'shoot-on-sight' kind of striker, which we love in FPL, and  Nottingham Forest 's underlying stats suggest they will give up plenty of chances when Liverpool roll up to the City Ground. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n Forest were lucky not to concede a hatful of goals  at Brighton & Hove Albion  in Gameweek 12. I expect Liverpool to put them to the sword with Nunez and  Mohamed Salah  (\u00a312.8m) both going big. \n Ben Crabtree\u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n It's hard to look past  Manchester City  at home, even when their opponent is good defensively.  Kevin De Bruyne  (\u00a312.3m) only has one goal so far this season, but I think he will add to that along with another assist. \n Sam Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n Having not played a fixture in midweek, I suspect that  Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.1m) will be back to goalscoring ways in Gameweek 13 and will be the top points scorer this week.  \n Bukayo Saka  (\u00a37.9m) will be up there too. He has returned in six of his last seven league matches. With 63 points, he is  Arsenal \u2019s top-scoring FPL asset. He is yellow flagged in the game though, so that is something for FPL managers to watch.\u00a0 \n Paul Gee ( @FPLPaulGee ) \n Haaland  is going to score big in a free-scoring Manchester City team. I also think \u00a0Nunez  will be a close second against a struggling Forest side. \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n Mohamed Salah  has the capability to be the highest scorer this week when he faces Forest. That is if Jurgen Klopp plays him as the central striker. \n Nick ( @WGTA_Nick )\u00a0\u00a0 \n Haaland  and Man City will be well rested ahead of their match with  Brighton  in Gameweek 13. I can see a big return for him this week. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n With a midweek rest many will look to the Man City attack for goals galore against Brighton. However, I'm backing  Nunez  to go big against a Forest team that concede a huge amount of chances. \n GW13 deadline: 11:00 BST, Sat 22 Oct \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  GW13 Ones to watch: Foden backed for more home joy Part 2:  GW13 Differentials: Traore can trouble Leicester Part 3:  Scout Selection: Best FPL team for Gameweek 13 Part 4:  GW13 Captains: Salah can outscore Haaland \n",

I didn\u2019t think I could be a FIFA pro \u2013 going home after school and playing, I didn\u2019t think I could turn it into a career. \n \"If you look at the Brentford boys last year, they were newcomers on the scene \u2013 especially Sam Brewster, I don\u2019t think many people had heard of him \u2013 and those guys made it to the final.\" \n That belief is also the key for those looking to follow in Shellzz\u2019s footsteps and forge a career in esports. \n \u201cTips I have for people going pro? Believe in yourself, adapt to the game, watch other pros, and try to take it easy.

The reigning champions have a Double Gameweek 23 and could also have a Double Gameweek 20. \n Nunez impresses \n Darwin Nunez  (\u00a39.0m) stepped up his claim to being the go-to replacement for the injured  Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a38.0m) in Fantasy by scoring twice in  Liverpool \u2019s 4-1 win over AC Milan on Friday. \n The Uruguayan is the second most-bought player in Fantasy in the last 24 hours, collecting 13,000+ new owners. \n Mohamed Salah  (\u00a312.8m), another player who was not involved in the World Cup, was also on the scoresheet. \n Crucially, managers will get a further chance to assess Liverpool and Man City options ahead of the  GW17 deadline of 11:00 GMT on Monday 26 December  as the two teams meet in the EFL Cup on Thursday 22 December. \n Mitrovic doubts? \n The absence of  Aleksandar Mitrovic  (\u00a36.8m) from  Fulham 's squad against  West Ham United  on Saturday could force a rethink in Fantasy.\u00a0 \n As a result of their upcoming Double Gameweek 19, the Cottagers\u2019 forward has been the most-bought player in each 24-hour period for a number of days.\u00a0 \n But due to his extended rest, it is uncertain whether he will start  against Crystal Palace in Gameweek 17 , and his owners may now have to rely on minutes off the bench.\u00a0 \n Fixtures factor \n Wilfried Zaha  (\u00a37.5m) and  Rodrigo  (\u00a36.3m) both showed why they should also be considered during the current unlimited free transfers period. \n Zaha again proved the talisman for  Crystal Palace , scoring both their goals in a 2-1 home win over Real Valladolid. \n The Eagles\u2019 upcoming schedule looks encouraging for his short-term prospects.\u00a0According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), each of their next two matches score just two. \n Rodrigo continued his prolific campaign for  Leeds United  by scoring in their 2-1 home win over Real Sociedad. \n Listed as a midfielder in Fantasy, the Spaniard has thrived while playing as a forward. \n Indeed, his average of 97.6 minutes per goal is second only to the 57.6 minutes of Haaland among regular players this season. \n Leeds have a kind mid-term run of opponents when the season resumes, with four of their next six matches scoring two in the FDR.\u00a0 \n",

He's in form, playing for a form team and has a point to prove ahead of the FIFA World Cup. He's the obvious replacement for Toney for me. \n I also own  Aleksandar Mitrovic  (\u00a36.9m) and Haaland. Given the money I have in Haaland he will be a hold; I plan on benching Mitrovic as it stands but this is reliant on the Manchester City forward being fit. \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n We are so close to the unlimited transfers that I think it is worth the risk to go for players like  Mitrovic ,  Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a38.0m) or  Harry Kane  (\u00a311.6m), who are all on four yellow cards. \n After all, it's a risk for one Gameweek only because if they get that yellow in Gameweek 16, then you can take them out using unlimited transfers anyway. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n I'll be avoiding any forward on four yellows this week especially if part of the appeal is their Gameweek 16 fixture. There's other options that don't carry this risk such as  Wilson  or playing five in midfield. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n Wilson  really wants to get into Gareth Southgate's England squad and Newcastle United are one of the league's most attacking sides, so he would be the obvious pick with Kane, Jesus and Mitrovic on four yellow cards. \n Lateriser ( @lateriser12 ) \n Since we only have two Gameweeks until we have unlimited transfers, I wouldn't worry too much about the likes of  Kane  and  Jesus  being on four yellows as even one game is 50 per cent of the remainder of the season as we know it. \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n I own both Kane and Jesus. Both being on four yellows is frustrating as it means that I could have an issue for Gameweek 16. If either of them does pick up a yellow I'll go for  Wilson . He looked like the perfect pick heading into Gameweek 14 and his return has solidified that feeling. \n Paul Gee\u00a0( @FPLPaulGee ) \n Toney is a must-sell and if I owned him the best replacement in the same price bracket is  Wilson . I wouldn't worry about any of the players on four yellows as we are so close to unlimited transfers. \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n With exact funds, I've already made the move from Toney to  Wilson  before he went up in price. Newcastle are in fantastic form and I'm now tripled up on their assets. \n GW15 deadline: 13:30 GMT Saturday 5 November \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 GW14 Lessons: All change up front Part 2:  Best FPL replacements for suspended Toney \n",

However, on the three previous occasions when they have lost this season in all competitions, City have gone on to win their next match. \n \n \n \n \n \n MUN \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 1 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n In-form stars are on Man Utd\u2019s side \n By contrast, Man Utd head into the derby in red-hot form, having won their last eight matches in all competitions, their best run for four years. \n At home, they have won their last nine, with the latest victory being Tuesday's 3-0 EFL Cup triumph over Charlton Athletic. \n Their free-scoring form is highlighted by the fact they have scored three goals in four of their last five matches. \n Marcus Rashford  is leading the way, scoring in each of his last six outings. In the midweek cup tie, he only needed half an hour as a substitute to strike twice. \n Having scored in his last eight home matches, he will relish the visit from Man City and back himself to end his five-match run without a goal against the Citizens in the Premier League. He has only had one shot on target across those derbies. \n City must also watch out for  Antony , who has hit form himself by scoring in his last two matches. \n The Brazilian struck with a long-range curling strike in the reverse fixture at the Etihad Stadium and, ominously for Guardiola's side, he scored a very similar goal against Charlton. \n \n \n \ud83d\udcab Simply stunning. Bravo,  @Antony00  \ud83d\udc4f #MUFC  ||  #CarabaoCup \n\u2014 Manchester United (@ManUtd)  January 11, 2023 \n \n Jones is leading Saints revival \n By his own admission,  Southampton 's new manager  Nathan Jones  has not enjoyed much of a honeymoon period. \n After losing his first four Premier League matches, there has been a clear improvement in the last week. \u00a0 \n On Saturday, Saints won 2-1 at Crystal Palace in the FA Cup and on Wednesday they earned a hugely impressive 2-0 home win over Man City in the EFL Cup. \n \"We were aggressive, we were organised, we went after the game,\" said Jones. \"It wasn't a smash and grab. \n \"I've had people calling me out. I've even had non-League managers calling me out saying I'm not good enough. \n \n \n \n \n \n EVE \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 2 \n \n SOU \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n \"It's a proud moment for me.

Newcastle have had 12 different scorers in the Premier League, the most in the competition. \n And on Tuesday,  Dan Burn  joined the list of players to find the net this season, scoring his first goal for his boyhood club in the 2-0 EFL Cup win over  Leicester City . \n \n \n Living the dream. \u2764\ufe0f What a way to score your first goal for your boyhood club! \ud83d\ude4c  pic.twitter.com/WQaeYFvKy3 \n\u2014 Newcastle United FC (@NUFC)  January 11, 2023 \n \n Semi-finalists face busy schedules \n While Man Utd are used to battling on a number of fronts, it is a rarer challenge for Newcastle, Southampton and  Nottingham Forest  in the second half of the season. \n All four clubs have plenty to play for in the Premier League, but the two-legged EFL Cup semi-finals will test their fitness, the depth of their squads and their managers' views on rotation. \n Furthermore, whoever qualify for the final on 26 February will have their Matchweek 25 fixtures postponed to a later date.\u00a0 \n Fixtures for semi-finalists \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n MUN \n NEW \n NFO \n SOU \n \n \n \n \n MW20 \n MCI (H) \n FUL (H) \n LEI (H) \n EVE (A) \n \n \n CRY (A) \n \n \n MW21 \n ARS (A) \n CRY (A) \n BOU (A) \n AVL (H) \n \n \n EFL \n NFO (A) \n SOU (A) \n MUN (H) \n NEW (H) \n \n \n FAC \n RDG (H) \n - \n - \n BLP (H) \n \n \n EFL \n NFO (H) \n SOU (H) \n MUN (A) \n NEW (A) \n \n \n MW22 \n CRY (H) \n WHU (H) \n LEE (H) \n BRE (A) \n \n \n MW25 \n BRE (H) \n BHA (H) \n WHU (A) \n LEE (A) \n \n \n \n",

Kane has done quite well despite  Tottenham Hotspur  not being fully in their rhythm. \n \n \n \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n There's a new king in Fantasy this season, he's from Norway and he's already on an incredible nine goals. There is a risk that Pep Guardiola rests him for the trip to Villa Park but, having come off early in the last two fixtures, it's a risk I'm willing to take.  Haaland  gets my armband again this week. \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n I'm prepared to take the risk on  Haaland  again this week on current form. His early substitution against  Nottingham Forest  gives me hope for minutes against Villa this weekend. \n Pras ( @Pras_fpl ) \n Captaincy seems wide open this week. After back-to-back hat-tricks, the natural pick would be Haaland, but with Sevilla, Spurs and Borussia Dortmund as their next three opponents in all competitions, I am sceptical on a Haaland start away to Villa. Aside from him, Kane against Fulham is the standout pick.

        "text": "\n Mohamed Salah (\u00a313.0m) was the most-backed captain in Gameweek 3 and the 2.4million\u00a0 Fantasy Premier League  managers who entrusted him with the armband were hugely relieved to see him score a late consolation goal in his side's  2-1 defeat at Manchester United on Monday . \n Liverpool 's Egyptian, who had produced an attacking return in four of his previous five appearances against the Red Devils, averaging 12 points per match, looked set to blank at Old Trafford. But Salah popped up with a header with nine minutes remaining, and received a bonus point to return eight points. \n There were mixed feelings for the 1.9m managers who captained Erling Haaland (\u00a311.7m), as the  Manchester City  striker scored his third goal of the season against  Newcastle United  on Sunday.\u00a0 \n Though Haaland was on target, he might have had a hat-trick but for the excellence of goalkeeper Nick Pope (\u00a35.0m) and a snatched chance from close range in the  3-3 thriller at St James' Park . \n Pope thwarted the Norwegian in the first half and turned another effort against the post in the second before Haaland blazed over late on. \n The result was six points for Haaland, which was at least two more than Gabriel Jesus (\u00a38.1m), who was the second-most captained player after Salah. \n The 2.3m managers who made the  Arsenal  forward their captain were left disappointed as he was limited to four points in  the Gunners' 3-0 win at AFC Bournemouth .\u00a0 \n Jesus bagged a 19-point haul in Gameweek 2 but could only manage an assist against the Cherries, while he also picked up a yellow card.\u00a0 \n The Brazilian was captained by just 45,000 fewer managers than Salah. \n GW3 most-captained players \n \n \n \n Player \n Captained by (000's) \n Pts \n \n \n \n \n Salah \n 2,432 \n 8 \n \n \n Jesus \n 2,386 \n 4 \n \n \n Haaland \n 1,938 \n 6 \n \n \n \n GW3 most transferred-in players \n \n \n \n Player \n Transferred in by ('000s) \n Pts \n \n \n \n \n Martinelli \n 1,287 \n 6 \n \n \n Rodrigo \n 994 \n 13 \n \n \n Jesus \n 922 \n 4 \n \n \n \n Gabriel Martinelli (\u00a36.3m) and Jesus both featured among the top three transfers in, thanks to their good form and appealing run of fixtures.

The former Portsmouth midfielder immediately made summer signing  Neto  his first-choice goalkeeper, replacing  Mark Travers . \n The Brazilian kept a clean sheet on his top-flight debut against  Wolves  and made a string of saves at Newcastle to help the Cherries earn another valuable point. \n Neto\u2019s save ratio stands at 76.9 per cent, compared with 44.8 per cent for Travers. \n The 33-year-old who arrived from Barcelona has also shown more authority inside his box, making more catches and punches than Travers, fully justifying O'Neil's call. \n O'Neil has also recalled attacking midfielder  Philip Billing , who scored 10 Championship goals in the 2021/22 promotion campaign. \n Billing has responded brilliantly, scoring in successive matches and being  shortlisted for September's EA SPORTS Player of the Month award . \n Billing's goal v Newcastle \n \n \n This man is on fire \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25  pic.twitter.com/y8YU3ogxm9 \n\u2014 AFC Bournemouth \ud83c\udf52 (@afcbournemouth)  September 17, 2022 \n \n O'Neil immediately moved away from Parker\u2019s defensive 5-4-1 formation, switching to 4-2-3-1. But in all three matches he has chosen to revert to a back three during the second half. \n The key difference with that pattern is that the players are pushing higher up to make that shape more of an offensive 3-4-2-1. \n O\u2019Neil\u2019s tactical shift made a huge difference at Forest, where his side came back from 2-0 down to win. \n In that match, it was noticeable how much he encouraged his midfielders and wing-backs to take more risks by making runs into advanced areas. \n The stats below prove that AFC Bournemouth have been bolder in an attacking sense since the change was made. \n BOU touches in opponents' box \n \n \n \n Manager \n Opponent \n Touches \n \n \n \n \n O'Neil \n Nott'm Forest \n 17 \n \n \n O'Neil \n Wolves \n 16 \n \n \n Parker \n Arsenal \n 12 \n \n \n O'Neil \n Newcastle \n 10 \n \n \n \n When Billing converted against Newcastle in their last encounter, five Cherries players were inside the Magpies' penalty box. \n O\u2019Neil has reduced caution and given his players the confidence to try and get at their opponents. \n They may have had the fewest shots in the division, but AFC Bournemouth are a fit, hard-working side who have outrun each of their seven opponents. \n That said, O\u2019Neil\u2019s arrival has still sparked a significant upturn in the distance covered by the players per 90 minutes. \n BOU distance covered (km) 22/23 \n \n \n \n Manager \n Opp. \n Km \n Manager \n Opp. \n Km \n \n \n \n \n Parker \n AVL \n 109.2 \n O'Neil \n WOL \n 115.4 \n \n \n Parker \n MCI \n 102.7 \n O'Neil \n NFO \n 110.1 \n \n \n Parker \n ARS \n 109.7 \n O'Neil \n NEW \n 110.0 \n \n \n Parker \n LIV \n 107.9 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Following their  9-0 defeat at Liverpool , AFC Bournemouth players ran an extra 7.5km in their next match at home to Wolves, totalling 115.4km. \n That was O\u2019Neil\u2019s first match and the team have followed that up by recording their second and third-highest numbers for distance covered in the next two outings. \n They are posing an increased goal threat because of additional forward runners, and in defence that collective endeavour has given them a more compact defensive shape. \n O\u2019Neil\u2019s efforts so far have been very impressive. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Chelsea set to benefit from Potter's flexible changes Part 3:\u00a0 How Ten Hag's short-term planning has revived Man Utd Part 4:  Bowen and Antonio can provide missing spark for West Ham Part 5:  Gundogan and Eriksen battle key to derby success Part 6:  Xhaka relishing more freedom at Arsenal \n",

Cancelo has shown attacking threat in the lesser fixtures and  Manchester City  have a fantastic run of matches post World Cup. \n Kieran Trippier  (\u00a35.9m): He is the top-scoring defender in the game, as well as being on free-kicks and corners and is part of a strong  Newcastle United  defence. \n Diogo Dalot  (\u00a34.8m): The  Manchester United  defence has historically not been that great, but under Erik ten Hag they have improved a lot, especially with Casemiro (\u00a34.9m) coming into the team. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Ben White  (\u00a34.7m): He is exceptional value playing on the right, and we have seen him getting forward in recent Gameweeks. \n Sven Botman  (\u00a34.4m): He offers exceptional value as a regular starter. \n Midfielders\u00a0 \n Bukayo Saka  (\u00a38.0m): He is in my team at the moment, but his involvement will depend on how far England go in the World Cup. He is Arsenal's penalty-taker and is on corners too, meaning he has multiple routes to points. \n Marcus Rashford  (\u00a36.7m): When he attacks from the left channel and cuts back in and shoots from his right foot, he looks lethal. They  play Nottingham Forest  at home as well as  AFC Bournemouth  in the first three fixtures post World Cup. \n Dejan Kulusevski  (\u00a38.0m): Initially there were fears that he'd lose his place to Richarlison (\u00a38.4m) but that hasn\u2019t come to fruition and I see Kulusevski as a very important cog in  Tottenham Hotspur 's attack. \n Leandro Trossard  (\u00a37.1m): He has been exceptional this season and  Brighton & Hove Albion  will pick up where they left off after the World Cup. \n Phil Foden  (\u00a38.3m): Managers had feared that he had lost a bit of Pep Guardiola's faith after being benched in three consecutive fixtures. But Foden is still an important player in Pep's side, so I back him to start most of the games after the World Cup. \n Make changes to your own FPL squad now \n Forwards \n Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.2m): A striker that I will of course have on my unlimited transfers draft. He had some injury problems at the back end of this phase of the season but he will have a nice little rest given that Norway aren't in the World Cup. \n Callum Wilson (\u00a37.4m) : Another striker I want to own after the break is the Newcastle striker. Wilson, historically, been a player who takes his chances. \n Darwin Nunez  (\u00a39.0m): The  Liverpool  striker started slowly especially with his  red card in Gameweek 2 . But he came back into the team when Luis Diaz   (\u00a37.8m) and   Diogo Jota (\u00a38.8m) were injured and made the starting position his own. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Nick Harris' GW17 squad Part 2:  Andy Park's GW17 squad Part 3:  Gianni Buttice's GW17 squad Part 5:  Sam Bonfield's GW17 squad \n",

This will allow squads greater time to recover. \n Previously clubs were given a minimum of 48 hours between matches.\u00a0 \u00a0 So, after the Boxing Day round of fixtures have been played on 26 and 27 December, the following matchweek will be played across 29, 30 and 31 December. \n The New Year matchweek, when  Chelsea host Manchester City , will be played on 2, 3, 4 and 5 January. \n Download all the fixtures \n Remember, you can get all 380 fixtures sent directly to your mobile device by using the\u00a0Premier League's digital calendar, which you can set up right now at\u00a0pl.ecal.com . \n",

Managers should only pick this option if their current squad is decimated and they are left with four or five players for Gameweek 8. \n Providing you can field between eight and 10 players without having to take a significant points deduction, a Free Hit or Triple Captain chip is best left alone for now. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Gameweek 8: What FPL managers need to know Part 3:  GW8 Ones to watch: Mitrovic to continue goal run Part 4:  GW8 Differentials: Isak has schedule to thrive Part 5:  FPL expert: Who to put in your Free Hit team \u00a0 Part 6:  FPL experts: What's the best chip for reduced GW8?

They are also awarded a point for every clean sheet their side keeps. \n Five goals and an assist since domestic action resumed in Gameweek 17 has helped  Manchester United 's  Marcus Rashford  (\u00a37.2m) become the most-popular midfielder in Fantasy. \n The England star is found in over 49 per cent of squads ahead of his  potential Double Gameweek 22 . \n His team-mate  Bruno Fernandes  (\u00a39.9m) has the form to prove a major differential for managers willing to spend big in midfield. \n The Portuguese is owned by a mere seven per cent of managers, yet has produced returns in five successive outings. \n In-form options \n Manchester City 's  Riyad Mahrez  (\u00a37.6m) has also stepped up his output ahead of their Double Gameweek 23. \n Crucially, the Algerian has started five of his side's last six matches since domestic action resumed. \n Three of his four goals this season, and four of his five assists, have come since Gameweek 17. \n Mahrez's second goal v Spurs \n \n \n Comeback: complete! \u2705 A delightful chip from  @Mahrez22  wrapped up all three points \ud83c\udf5f  pic.twitter.com/EKOEZ1v5RK \n\u2014 Manchester City (@ManCity)  January 20, 2023 \n \n Brighton & Hove Albion 's midfielders have emerged as key sources of value under new head coach Roberto De Zerbi. \n Solly March  (\u00a35.2m) has recorded his three double-figure returns this term in the last five Gameweeks, while  Kaoru Mitoma  (\u00a35.1m) has only a single blank in seven appearances. \n Such budget-friendly options can help free-up cash for big spends elsewhere in attack. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Bargain Kepa outperforming Pope Part 2:  Trippier on course for record-breaking campaign Part 3:  James and Chilwell can shake up defences Part 4:\u00a0 Why Trippier earns so many bonus points Part 6:  Ferguson can unlock Kane and Haaland combo Part 7:  Mitoma the go-to Almiron replacement \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at key tactical points and players who can be decisive this season. \n Lucas Paqueta (WHU) \n Summer signing Paqueta has the talent to be a difference-maker for  West Ham United  in 2022/23. \n The 25-year-old performed steadily, without being spectacular, against  Tottenham Hotspur  and  Chelsea , but his influence will grow for the Hammers. \n Last time out, the Brazil international played in a No 10 role, behind  Jarrod Bowen  and  Michail Antonio  in a  2-1 loss at Stamford Bridge . \n This position suits Paqueta, who can also play as an attack-minded box-to-box midfielder in a three-man midfield. \n Pass master \n During his time with former club Lyon, his eye for a pass was well known. \n This could be great news for Bowen and Antonio, in particular this weekend, and in the months to come, as they are two players who love to run in behind opposition defences. \n Lionel Messi and former West Ham star  Dimitri Payet  were the only players in Ligue 1 to deliver more accurate through-balls than Paqueta last season. \n Most through-balls Ligue 1 2021/22* \n \n \n \n Player \n Club \n Through-balls \n \n \n \n \n Lionel Messi \n PSG \n 24 \n \n \n Dimitri Payet \n Marseille \n 15 \n \n \n Lucas Paqueta \n Lyon \n 12 \n \n \n Neymar \n PSG \n 12 \n \n \n Bruno Guimaraes \n Lyon \n 11 \n \n \n \n David Moyes \u2019 side have only scored three goals this season, meaning Paqueta\u2019s arrival provides a welcome boost in that department. \n He scored nine league goals in both 2021/22 and 2020/21, breaking into the opposition box with great frequency to finish with his wonderful left foot. \n A sign of how often Paqueta likes to get into advanced areas can be seen in the table below. \n Most shots Ligue 1 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Club \n Total shots \n \n \n \n \n Kylian Mbappe \n PSG \n 144 \n \n \n Andy Delort \n Nice \n 112 \n \n \n Seko Fofana \n Lens \n 98 \n \n \n Gaetan Laborde \n Rennes \n 96 \n \n \n Lionel Messi \n PSG \n 89 \n \n \n Lucas Paqueta \n Lyon \n 87 \n \n \n \n Only five players in Ligue 1 attempted more shots last term, as he averaged 2.9 per 90 minutes. \n While  Tomas Soucek  has always offered late forward runs into the box, the Hammers have been crying out for other midfielders to offer regular support to the strikers. \n Paqueta, wherever he is deployed, will energetically make up ground to join in with attacks and help create clearer chances. \n West Ham have faced Chelsea, Spurs,  Manchester City  and in-form  Brighton & Hove Albion , which should be taken into consideration, but for open-play expected goals (xG), they rank second-lowest at the moment. \n Lowest xG in open play* \n \n \n \n Club \n Open-play xG* \n \n \n \n \n AFC Bournemouth \n 1.9 \n \n \n West Ham \n 3.5 \n \n \n Leicester \n 3.8 \n \n \n Fulham \n 4.0 \n \n \n Nott'm Forest \n 4.3 \n \n \n \n *Stats from 16 September \n Moyes will also have been attracted by Paqueta\u2019s industry out of possession. \n He is primarily known as a very skilful attacking-midfielder, but does not shy away from other team duties. \n *Most pressures Ligue 1 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Club \n Pressures \n \n \n \n \n Laurent Abergel \n Lorient \n 918 \n \n \n Adrien Thomasson \n Strasbourg \n 792 \n \n \n Lucas Paqueta \n Lyon \n 724 \n \n \n \n He won 61 tackles last season, ranking him sixth in Ligue 1 and racked up an incredible 724 pressures to the man on the ball, too. \n This was the third-highest figure in that division, so Paqueta will press midfielders and central defenders with plenty of enthusiasm. \n An exciting, forward-thinking acquisition, Paqueta looks destined to become a key player for West Ham. \n",

        "summary": "Aston Villa winger among standout performers to impress during summer friendlies",
        "text": "\n The Scout's  panel of experts \u00a0reveal the players who have impressed them the most in pre-season ahead of the start of 2022/23  Fantasy Premier League . \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Aston Villa  head coach Steven Gerrard said  Leon Bailey  has come back a \"different player\" in pre-season, the winger producing three goals and two assists. At \u00a35.0m, with a great looking  Gameweek 1 fixture against AFC Bournemouth , I expect him to be in a few teams.\u00a0 \n Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a38.0m) seems to be relishing his new role in this very youthful and creative  Arsenal  side. With a manager that knows his style from his  Manchester City  days, Jesus looks primed for points in Gameweek 1. \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n When  Bailey  signed for Villa last term I was very excited, but an injury-ravaged campaign meant that he never became an option in Fantasy. However, Gerrard's comments this pre-season, as well as Bailey\u2019s form, mean that he has become a key target for me. At \u00a35.0m, he is also the perfect budget enabler.\u00a0 \n Marcus Rashford  (\u00a36.5m) and  Manchester United  were firmly off the radar last term but the impact of Erik ten Hag is already being felt. Rashford has the added incentive of the FIFA World Cup to build form for. He could be a great pick. \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the \u00a3100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n Andy Park ( @FPL_Sonaldo ) \n I'm very keen on  Ivan Perisic  (\u00a35.5m). His start and 60+ minutes against Roma at the weekend has given me the green light to go for such an explosive player. \n Bailey  is extremely enticing. At just \u00a35.0m, he has been giving us Said Benrahma (\u00a36.0m) vibes from this time last season. He could be a key enabler to start the campaign. The only worry is that he is one bad performance away from being dropped.\u00a0 \n Jamie Pigott\u00a0 ( @Futbolislifefpl ) \n Jesus  is one I have my eye on even if I don't go into Gameweek 1 with him. He's currently the most-owned player off the back of this pre-season. Let's see if he can continue to perform once the matches matter. \n Perisic  is another. I was looking to see if he'd get minutes in Spurs' pre-season. He's started in the final match, which makes me confident of his minutes for Gameweek 1. \n Ben McNair\u00a0 ( @drbenmcnair ) \n I tend to resist targets that emerge from pre-season because a small sample of friendlies shouldn't really change our priorities. \n I might make an exception for  Jesus . He has price and fixtures on his side and pre-season looks to have confirmed his minutes and role in the Arsenal side. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  Martinelli a cut-price gem \n Don't forget the Gameweek 1 deadline is 18:30 BST on Friday 5 August. \n",

That total places him second for Man Utd and fifth among defenders. \n Bring Dalot into your FPL team now \n Elsewhere,  Aleksandar Mitrovic  (\u00a36.8m) was on the scoresheet for the second successive group fixture for Serbia. \n However, the  Fulham  forward\u2019s goal was not enough to prevent his nation exiting the tournament after slipping to a 3-2 loss to Switzerland. \n The extra time off from international duties has lifted the appeal of Mitrovic when the campaign gets back underway. \n Indeed he is second only to  Marcus Rashford  (\u00a36.7m) for transfers in over the last 24 hours. \n First starts for Arsenal pair \n Arsenal \u2019s popular Fantasy pair  Gabriel Martinelli  (\u00a36.8m) and  Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a38.0m) were both handed their first starts of the tournament as Brazil rang the changes for their meeting with Cameroon. \n But the pair look likely to return to the substitutes bench for the last-16 tie against South Korea on Monday after failing to make an impact in the 1-0 defeat. \n All eyes on the last 16\u00a0 \n The knockout stages of the tournament get under way tomorrow when the Netherlands face USA. \n Manchester City \u2019s  Nathan Ake  (\u00a35.0m) and  Liverpool \u2019s  Virgil van Dijk  (\u00a36.5m) are expected to be part of a Dutch defence that have kept four clean sheets in their last five matches. \n Christian Pulisic  (\u00a35.7m) could prove decisive for USA once again if he recovers from a knock. The  Chelsea  star has been involved in both his nation\u2019s goals in the tournament, including his winner against Iran last time out. \n Argentina take on Australia later on Saturday, with the South Americans boasting a pair of in-form Premier League players. \n Brighton & Hove Albion \u2019s  Alexis Mac Allister  (\u00a35.4m) and Man City\u2019s  Julian Alvarez  (\u00a36.0m) both started and scored against Poland to help seal their place in the last 16.\u00a0 \n Saturday\u2019s matches 15:00 GMT Holland v USA 19:00 GMT Argentina v Australia \n",

        "text": "\n After 25 years without a top-flight title,  Liverpool  turned to  Jurgen Klopp  in October 2015, appointing the German as manager following the end of  Brendan Rodgers ' reign. \n His  first match in charge  was a trip to  Tottenham Hotspur , and one look at that starting XI highlights the journey Klopp was about to embark on in his bid to end the Reds' title drought.\u00a0 \n Simon Mignolet ;  Nathaniel Clyne ,  Martin Skrtel ,  Mamadou Sakho ,  Alberto Moreno ;  Lucas Leiva ,  Emre Can ;  James Milner ,  Adam Lallana ,  Philippe Coutinho ;  Divock Origi \n Fast forward to the 2019/20 season and Liverpool's side had been transformed. \n Initially it was in attack where Klopp looked to put his stamp on the side. \n Roberto Firmino , a 2015 summer signing from Hoffenheim, was deployed as a \"false nine\" and became a thorn in the side of defences who were bent out of shape by the Brazilian dropping deep to link up with the attackers swarming around him. \n His role as the creative spark in the front three led to him creating eight goals in 2019/20, including a  hat-trick of assists  in a 4-0 win against  Southampton .\u00a0 \n Sadio Mane  arrived from Southampton the following season and was an instant hit. \n The Senegalese scored an  outstanding debut goal against Arsenal  and continued to frighten defences thereafter with his pace and eye for goal. Mane claimed the Premier League Golden Boot in 2018/19 and scored 18 of his 90 PL goals in the Reds' title-winning season. \n Mohamed Salah  was the jewel in the crown of Klopp's attack. In his debut campaign in 2017/18, Salah broke the record for the most goals in a 38-match season, netting 32 times. \n His combination of pace, skill and ability to cut in from the right flank reaped 19 goals in the title-clinching season. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n In midfield,  Jordan Henderson  had perhaps his best season in 2019/20. He scored four goals and provided five assists, but offered so much more in terms of leadership, positioning and tackling ability. \n His commanding influence on the team earned Henderson the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year award. \n Fabinho  was another rock in Liverpool's midfield, halting opposition attacks at source to protect the back four. He also had an eye for a long-range goal in 2019/20, scoring in matches  against Crystal Palace , and crucially,  Manchester City .\u00a0\u00a0 \n One of Klopp's first signings,  Georginio Wijnaldum , was an understated presence in midfield. Tidy, tireless and positionally on-point, the Dutchman featured in all but one match in 2019/20, weighing in with four goals.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n It was in defence, however, where Liverpool changed from contenders to champions. \n After breaking into the first team in 2016/17,  Trent Alexander-Arnold  redefined the role of the right-back, producing a series of outstanding displays as Liverpool's chief playmaker. \n In 2019/20 he laid on a remarkable 13 assists and scored four goals, numbers that earned him the Premier League's inaugural  Young Player of the Season award . \n On the opposite flank,  Andrew Robertson  was another menace going forward. Signed from Hull City in 2017, the Scotland captain proved an outstanding piece of scouting. \n In the title-winning campaign, Robertson produced 12 assists, with only Alexander-Arnold (13) and  Kevin De Bruyne  (20) creating more.\u00a0\u00a0 \n In the heart of defence  Virgil van Dijk , signed from Southampton in January 2018, was key to keeping out some of the best forwards in the division. \n Powerful, quick, assured in possession and a superb reader of the game, the imperious Van Dijk was ever-present in 2019/20 as Liverpool strode to the Premier League crown. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Although he missed nine matches in 2019/20,  Alisson  proved invaluable as the last line of defence, producing brilliant saves when called upon. His excellence between the sticks helped Liverpool concede only 33 goals, the fewest in the Premier League.\u00a0 \n Liverpool had travelled a long way from the team that lined up against Spurs in October 2015 to the side that ended a 30-year wait to become champions. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  PL30: Klopp's champions Part 2:  PL30: How Klopp transformed Liverpool into champions \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout\u2019s panel of  Fantasy Premier League  experts discuss the key dilemmas facing managers when building their Gameweek 17 squads with the unlimited free transfers.\u00a0 \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n It's always useful to have a slot for an \u00a38.0m midfielder since there are so many excellent options available to hop on or off around fixture swings.   \n Luis Diaz  (\u00a37.8m) should be back fit soon but I think  Bukayo Saka  (\u00a38.0m) is the standout pick in this bracket with secure minutes in an  Arsenal  side that are top of the table and scoring lots of goals. \n Geoff Dance\u00a0( @GeoffreyDance ) \n The all-round potential of  James   Maddison \u00a0(\u00a38.2m) makes him my favourite pick. The  Leicester City  playmaker has produced 39 shots and created 31 chances. He is the only midfielder to rank among the top four for both statistics. \n A lack of European competition for Leicester reduces any chance of Maddison being rotated and arguably makes him the most secure starter in this bracket. \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n The \u00a38.0m midfielder slot was one that I was very keen on in Gameweek 1. However, over the early part of the season, the players didn't perform in the way that I was expecting. But the later Gameweeks have seen a shift. Now there's a wealth of great options including the likes of  Saka  and  Maddison . \n However, it\u2019s  Dejan Kulusevski  (\u00a38.0m) who is my preferred pick. The  Tottenham Hotspur \u00a0star has recovered from injury and his country, Sweden, were not involved in the FIFA World Cup 2022. Spurs also have nice fixtures and could also have a Double Gameweek 20. \n See:\u00a0 Two possible Double Gameweeks for Man City \n West Ham United \u2019s fixtures mean  Jarrod Bowen  (\u00a38.0m) could be a great differential too. I am also keeping an eye on  Liverpool \u2019s  Diaz.  If he is fit to play in Gameweek 17 he could be a brilliant pick for their nice fixture run. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n There's definitely still value in the \u00a38.0m midfield price bracket.  Manchester City 's  Phil Foden  (\u00a38.3m) will still be at the front of my mind, assuming he comes back from Qatar in good shape, but it looks like  Diaz  will be available for Liverpool and back on the radar. \n The Colombian has three goals and two assists in eight appearances this season, and Jurgen Klopp will need one of his key attacking players fit and firing when the Premier League resumes on Boxing Day. \n Nick ( @WGTA_Nick ) \n There are still plenty of options in the \u00a38.0m bracket, with some excellent players at very affordable prices.  Saka ,  Maddison  and  Foden  are three that can easily slot in as a second or third midfielder in our squads. \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n The \u00a38.0m midfielders are still at the forefront of my thinking. I will certainly be keeping a minimum of two slots in my team for this price point. \n Foden ,  Saka ,  Kulusevski  and  Diaz  can rival any premium players at their respective clubs. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Best Newcastle picks Part 2:  Best Arsenal picks Part 4:  How many premiums should managers pick?

Indeed, they are the only side who avoid all of last season\u2019s top six in the first six Gameweeks. \n Kane overlooked \n The rush to bring in Haaland and Jesus has made  Harry Kane  (\u00a311.5m) a major differential. \n Fewer than 16 per cent of managers own the  Tottenham Hotspur  forward, who looks a strong armband option  at home to Southampton  and  Wolverhampton Wanderers  in the first three Gameweeks. \n Kane was a huge success after the arrival of Antonio Conte as head coach in Gameweek 11 last season. \n His total of 167 points from that moment until the end of the season was bettered by only two other players in Fantasy. \n Line up Liverpool differentials? \n Elsewhere,  Liverpool  pair  Darwin Nunez  and  Diogo Jota  (both \u00a39.0m) have been largely overlooked due to the popularity of their team-mates. \n Reds trio Trent Alexander-Arnold (\u00a37.5m), Mohamed Salah (\u00a313.0m) and Luis Diaz (\u00a38.0m) are all owned in over 32 per cent of squads.\u00a0 \n Certainly, the arrival of Darwin from Benfica increases the chances of rotation in the lone-striker role at the start of 2022/23, with the Uruguayan initially expected to share minutes with Jota. \n Cheap options \n Finally, managers have turned to  Leeds United \u2019s  Sam Greenwood  and  Nottingham Forest \u2019s  Lyle Taylor  (both \u00a34.5m) as a means of freeing up budget.\u00a0 \n Neither player has been a first-team regular, which suggests they have simply been purchased to sit on managers\u2019 benches, allowing them to spend funds elsewhere. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 Most popular players Part 2:\u00a0 Raya and Sanchez the budget favourites Part 3:\u00a0 Premium defenders dominate Part 4:\u00a0 Managers flock to Diaz \n Don't miss an FPL deadline again \n",

Yet overall, his record is pretty strong. He has scored 58 times, averaging a goal every 205 minutes.  \u00a0 \n When you factor in his 28 assists, Martial has contributed directly to a goal every 138.8 minutes in the Premier League.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n Eye for a killer pass \n Martial provides Man Utd with pace, creativity and strong finishing from the No 9 position. \n He has the speed to make runs in behind defences. And, as he showed when supplying assists for Rashford in the  2-1 win v Liverpool \u00a0and  Antony  in the  2-1 victory at Everton , he can also play precise through-balls that release team-mates for 1v1 situations. \u00a0 \n \n \n Direct.

        "text": "\n The Scout's panel of  Fantasy Premier League  experts speak about how they plan to navigate  Manchester City 's Blank Gameweek 12. \n What the experts say \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Man City are too good right now. They have two home matches at the Etihad Stadium in Gameweeks 9 and 10, so I'll be keeping all three of my Man City players.  Joao Cancelo  (\u00a37.2m),  Kevin De Bruyne  (\u00a312.3m) and  Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.0m) might be the most expensive route into a Man City triple-up, but it's worth it.  \n De Bruyne to  Mohamed Salah  (\u00a312.9m) is my most likely transfer for Blank Gameweek 12, as Salah will provide a good captaincy option. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n Owning triple Man City right now feels very right. Sure they blank in Gameweek 12 where I will likely be bringing Salah in for De Bruyne. However, until then I want triple Man City, even with the  Liverpool fixture  in Gameweek 11. \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n Man City head into the next four Gameweeks with two tough fixtures  against Manchester United  and  Liverpool , as well as a blank. However, I don't think they are an immediate sell, since they are favourites to win any match, especially at home. \n Thereafter, managers may want to consider offloading. However, with the inevitable value tied up in Haaland, one could consider simply benching him in Blank Gameweek 12.  \n Managers on a Gameweek 9 Wildcard may want to only own Haaland and Cancelo. They could opt for Salah or  Harry Kane  (\u00a311.4m) as the second premium. \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n I have three Man City players. One is goalkeeper  Ederson  (\u00a35.5m) but it's less of an issue when it comes to Gameweek 12. I will simply be able to bench him in favour of my second goalkeeper,\u00a0 Danny Ward  (\u00a34.0m), for that week.  \n If I were Wildcarding now I would own just Cancelo and Haaland and then bring in a third player from Gameweek 13 onwards.  \n Doing this means managers do not have to worry about fielding a full XI when both Man City and  Arsenal  blank in Gameweek 12. This could be really important if they also own the likes of  Gabriel Martinelli  (\u00a36.6m) and  Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a38.1m) from the Gunners. \n Geoff Dance\u00a0( @GeoffreyDance ) \n If I still had a Wildcard to play, I would now keep it until Gameweek 13. \n This allows those managers the unique opportunity of selling Haaland for Gameweek 12 before bringing him back immediately on a Wildcard. \n Their mini-league rivals are almost certain to keep Haaland and bench him for that week, rather than sell him and buy him back. \n Playing a Gameweek 13 Wildcard gives you that chance to dead-end your team and go against Haaland's 80 per cent ownership for Man City's Blank Gameweek 12. \n Man City's final four matches before the season breaks for the FIFA World Cup are just too good to ignore and a triple-up with Cancelo, De Bruyne and Haaland is my plan. \n Ben Crabtree\u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n I think it's worth keeping Man City players for the Liverpool game and through Blank Gameweek 12. They can score well against Liverpool and there is time now to start improving your bench to ensure a good 11 for Gameweek 12. \n Nick ( @WGTA_Nick )\u00a0\u00a0 \n Haaland is a must-own, while Cancelo is proving himself to be a strong and consistent selection in defence, picking up three bonus even with no attacking returns. \n De Bruyne is an expensive option in midfield but also is rewarding owners with his excellent performances week in, week out. I don't think there is a danger of tripling up, even with an upcoming blank, which can be navigated with a couple of transfers around that time. \n Pranil Sheth ( @Lateriser12 )\u00a0 \n I do think you can consider swerving De Bruyne for Salah if you are planning to captain Salah in Gameweek 9, but I also like the idea of  Phil Foden  (\u00a38.0m) who will keep ticking over the points.\u00a0 \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 GW8 FPL stats: Haaland delivers as the record captain pick Part 2:\u00a0 GW8 Bonus points:\u00a0Saliba takes top returns Part 3:  Saturday review: Son can provide KDB and Salah solution Part 4:  Keep or sell Man City stars in FPL? \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at key tactical points and players who can be decisive in Matchweek 9. \n Erik ten Hag (MUN) \n The  Manchester United  head coach reacted to defeats in his first two matches by altering his tactics. \n \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n 6 - 3 \n \n MUN \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n At Ajax, during a successful pre-season at Man Utd, and across the first 180 minutes of this season, the Dutchman encouraged a possession-based brand of football built around making short passes through the lines. \n After seeing his new team make errors under pressure inside their own half in the  2-1 home defeat by Brighton & Hove Albion  and  the 4-0 drubbing at Brentford  there was a short-term rethink from Ten Hag. \n In the last four matches, all of which brought victories, United have been far more direct, with a greater emphasis on turning defence into attack more quickly. \n For example, all three of their goals in the  3-1 home victory over Arsenal  came from swiftly constructed attacks that began inside United's own half and caught the Gunners' high line cold. \n How possession & passing changed \n \n \n \n Stat \n MW1-2 ave. \n MW3-6 ave. \n \n \n \n \n Possession\u00a0 \n 64.8% \n 41.7% \n \n \n Passes \n 536 \n 375 \n \n \n % of long passes \n 8.4% \n 16.3% \n \n \n \n There has been a stark contrast in the way Ten Hag has approached the last four matches, compared with those opening two encounters. \n Fixtures against  Liverpool ,  Arsenal  and  Leicester City  played a part to some degree, but there has been an acceptance on the Dutchman's part that his side are not yet ready to control matches through heavy spells of possession. \n Across the last four fixtures, which also included a  1-0 win at Southampton , they averaged 375 passes per match, a 30 per cent drop on what we had seen before. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n There has also been an attempt to launch longer passes from back to front. \n United's long-pass proportion has doubled since those early defeats against Brighton and Brentford. \n Playing safe from the back \n In their first match of the season,  David De Gea  made just seven long passes out of a total of 26, with short goal-kick restarts the norm. \n When  Liverpool  visited Old Trafford a fortnight later, 30 of the 31 passes made by the goalkeeper were classified as \"long\". \n Although there has not been such a high percentage in the matches that have ensued, this pattern of change has continued with the vast majority of De Gea's distribution hit over longer distances. \n United players' long-passing ratios \n \n \n \n Player \n MW1-2 ave. \n MW3-6 ave. \n \n \n \n \n De Gea \n 38.5% \n 73.0% \n \n \n Martinez \n 9.1% \n 20.6% \n \n \n Varane \n 8.0% \n 15.1% \n \n \n \n It is a similar story with central defenders  Lisandro Martinez  and  Raphael Varane . \n Both players are being encouraged to strike passes into the channels or up to the centre-forward. \n It is also worth noting that Varane made only 20 and 13 passes against Arsenal and Liverpool respectively. \n His role as a ball-playing centre-back was put on hold in matches where Ten Hag was concerned about the quality of the opposition and their pressing. \n Adjusting to Ten Hag's style \n Over time it is almost certain Ten Hag will introduce the style of play with which he has been associated during his management career. \n United will eventually develop more control of matches through possession and learn to be comfortable playing out from the back. \n However, Ten Hag has recognised that, in the short term, his group of players are better suited to a style of play that makes use of their pace in forward areas. The Dutchman's tactical input will evolve, rather than be implemented overnight. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Chelsea set to benefit from Potter's flexible changes Part 2:\u00a0 How O'Neil's changes have lifted AFC Bournemouth Part 4:  Bowen and Antonio can provide missing spark for West Ham Part 5:  Gundogan and Eriksen battle key to derby success Part 6:  Xhaka relishing more freedom at Arsenal \n",

This fits well with his flexible, strategically fluid style of in-game management. \n Under  Thomas Tuchel ,  Chelsea  usually lined up in a 3-4-2-1 or 3-4-1-2 formation, but from the start and middle of matches, Potter will ask his players to fit into a wide range of shapes. \n During 2021/22, he used 13 different systems of play at  Brighton & Hove Albion , the most of any Premier League head coach. His preferred set-up was 3-5-2, but this only featured in 23.7 per cent of Brighton's matches. \n Potter likes to keep rival managers guessing when it comes to the tactical structure of his team. \n Most formations used 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Manager \n Different formations \n Main formation \n Times used \n \n \n \n \n Potter \n 13 \n 3-5-2 \n 9 \n \n \n Rodgers \n 10 \n 4-2-3-1 \n 16 \n \n \n Smith \n 10 \n 4-2-3-1 \n 11 \n \n \n Hasenhuttl \n 8 \n 4-4-2 \n 28 \n \n \n \n In Potter's first match in charge of Chelsea, a 1-1 draw with RB Salzburg in the UEFA Champions League, we witnessed some of his early ideas. \n The use of  Raheem Sterling  as a left-wing back will have shocked some observers, but at Brighton he would often put  Leandro Trossard , a similar attacking player, in that role, too. \n Sterling was not inhibited by this unusual role, enjoying eight touches in the opposition box and putting his team ahead. \n Possession won in final and middle third \n \n \n \n Club \n Poss. won in final third \n Club \n Poss. won middle third \n \n \n \n \n LIV \n 287 \n LIV\u00a0 \n 1106 \n \n \n MCI \n 240 \n LEE \n 1037 \n \n \n BHA \n 219 \n BHA \n 1003 \n \n \n CHE \n 181 \n CHE \n 983 \n \n \n \n Pressing with organisation and detail also forms a key part of Potter's philosophy. \n He likes to set up traps, especially when opponents pass out from the back. \n So, keep a lookout for changes to the way Chelsea defend inside the opposition half. \n Central midfielders and wide attackers will be asked to step forward and pressurise opponents with greater frequency. \n After seven rounds of matches, Brighton are joint leaders for shots from high turnovers, with 10. Potter's new team, Chelsea, boast just five by comparison. \n Chelsea's upcoming opponents must be wary of this change of tact when they keep possession inside their own half. \n Goals to come? \n Brighton had a reputation for creating lots of opportunities, but scoring relatively few goals. \n Their 8.9 per cent conversion rate was the lowest of all 17 sides who did not get relegated last term. \n They also ranked 16th for the number of shots they attempted per goal, way behind Chelsea (sixth), who needed an average of 3.6 fewer shots to find the back of the net compared to Brighton. \n Most shots per goal 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Club \n Shots per goal \n \n \n \n \n Leicester \n 7.0 \n \n \n Spurs \n 7.1 \n \n \n Man City \n 7.2 \n \n \n West Ham \n 7.5 \n \n \n Liverpool \n 7.7 \n \n \n Chelsea \n 7.8 \n \n \n Brighton \n 11.4 \n \n \n \n Working with better finishers at Stamford Bridge, there is a hope that Potter's formula will yield far more goals at Chelsea. \n This is an exciting opportunity for Potter, who has rightly been recognised as one of the brightest coaches in the division. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:\u00a0 How O'Neil's changes have lifted AFC Bournemouth Part 3:\u00a0 How Ten Hag's short-term planning has revived Man Utd Part 4:  Bowen and Antonio can provide missing spark for West Ham Part 5:  Gundogan and Eriksen battle key to derby success Part 6:  Xhaka relishing more freedom at Arsenal \n",

Kevin De Bruyne (\u00a312.2m) looks the next best alternative, but  Crystal Palace  can be a tough nut to crack.\u00a0 \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n AFC Bournemouth will go to Anfield and sit in, minimising space in behind for Salah and Luis Diaz (\u00a38.0m). With Thiago (\u00a35.3m) missing, Liverpool will find the Cherries hard to break down. So I'm going with the man in form at  Arsenal ,  Jesus . \n The Brazilian got a huge 19-point haul in Gameweek 2 and has been unlucky not to bring home double-digit points in the other two matches he's played. He's been outstanding.\u00a0 \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n I'm really torn this week. I don't own Harry Kane (\u00a311.4m), otherwise I would captain him.

However, while Liverpool are out of form, Salah is still returning. It's between the two, but I am leaning towards  Jesus  at the moment.\u00a0 \n Sonaldo ( @FPL_Sonaldo ) \n Erling Haaland (\u00a311.7m), De Bruyne, Salah and Jesus present themselves as great captaincy options this week with solid home fixtures. While you could pick any of the above, I try not to get too differential with the captaincy picks, particularly this early in the season.  Salah  at home to a defensively weak AFC Bournemouth is a straightforward as it gets.\u00a0 \n Jamie Pigott\u00a0 ( @Futbolislifefpl ) \n I can't overlook  Salah  at home to AFC Bournemouth. it feels like a prime fixture to target. I'm not worried about Liverpool's recent form as they'll be motivated to turn it around and change the narrative. \n \n \n \n Paul Gee ( @FPLPaulGee ) \n It has to be  Salah . AFC Bournemouth look they are going to be the whipping boys. Haaland is a good alternative as he looks nailed on after limited minutes in the midweek friendly against Barcelona. \n Kelly Somers\u00a0 ( @KellySomers ) \n If I owned Kane I\u2019d be tempted by him at  Nottingham Forest  but, as I don\u2019t, it\u2019s  Salah  because of his incredible record against AFC Bournemouth. I\u2019m expecting a response at home to the promoted side and his record of eight goals and one assist in his last six league meetings with the Cherries is too hard to ignore. \n Nick\u00a0 ( @WGTA_Nick )\u00a0\u00a0 \n Liverpool may not be at their barnstorming best right now but  Salah  has still been on the scoresheet and I expect them to come back firing against AFC Bournemouth at home, which is the perfect fixture for the Reds to find some form.\u00a0 \n Pras ( @Pras_fpl ) \n Despite Liverpool's recent struggles, a home contest against a promoted team is too good to ignore.  Salah  is the standout captain this week. \n While his rivals Haaland, Kane and Jesus are also on penalties, what separates the Egyptian is the extra point for a goal and a likely clean sheet point. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  GW4 Captains: De Bruyne to challenge popular trio Part 2:\u00a0 Scout Selection: Best FPL team for Gameweek 4 \n Don't forget the Gameweek 4 deadline is 11:00 BST on Saturday 27 August. \n",

        "text": "\n The transfer of  Joao Cancelo  from  Manchester City  to Bayern Munich means  Fantasy Premier League  has lost one of its best defenders of recent times, albeit one who was slipping off the radar of late.\u00a0 \n A string of blanks and absences from Gameweek 17 meant more than half a million FPL managers had sold the Portuguese before his move was confirmed. But he provided so many good memories for those who owned him. \n Here are some of the reasons why Cancelo became an FPL legend. \n No defender could beat his nine double-figure hauls over the last two seasons, joint-top with  Trent Alexander-Arnold  (\u00a37.3m). \u00a0 \n Over the last two seasons, Cancelo had 98 shots, 26 of which were on target. Both of these stats were top among Premier League defenders. \n Since the 2020/21 season, Cancelo registered 17 assists, five goals and\u00a044 clean sheets in the competition. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n 2021/22 season\u00a0 \n Last season, Cancelo was the second-highest scoring defender in the game, with 201 points. Only Alexander-Arnold outscored him, with 208. \n Cancelo also became an FPL favourite because he was one of the few Man City players who avoided \"Pep roulette\". He started in 36 of their 38 Premier League matches in 2021/22. \n From those 36 starts, he averaged an impressive 5.6 FPL points per start. He ranked top for expected goals (xG) among defenders. \n In a team full of stars, Cancelo's 31 returns that season were the most of any City player and could only be beaten by four other players.\u00a0 \n Alongside\u00a0 Son Heung-min  (\u00a311.6m), Cancelo was the player whose FPL price went up the most during 2021/22, rising by \u00a31.6m across the campaign.\u00a0 \n 2022/23 season \n Until Gameweek 17 of this season, Cancelo had started 50 of the last 51 league matches for which he was available. But threafter that started to change; he started only two matches and was withdrawn at half-time of the  1-0 win at Chelsea  in Gameweek 19. \n Yet, despite this lack of minutes since the FIFA World Cup 2022, Cancelo leaves with more returns than any other Man City defender this season: 10. \n His three double-figure scores in home matches this season are bettered by only  Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.2m) and  Marcus Rashford  (\u00a37.2m), with five and four respectively. \n Cancelo's 12 chances created this season are seven clear of\u00a0 Nathan Ake  (\u00a35.0m), who is City's next most creative defender. \n Two of Cancelo's biggest FPL returns have come during this season. He returned 18 points in the  4-0 victory over Southampton  in Gameweek 10 and 12 points in the  6-0 success against Nottingham Forest  in Gameweek 5.\u00a0 \n Cancelo's biggest FPL returns \n \n \n \n Season \n Opp. \n Result \n FPL points \n \n \n \n \n 2022/23 \n SOU (H) \n 4-0 \n 18 \n \n \n 2021/22 \n NEW (A) \n 0-4 \n 18 \n \n \n 2020/21 \n WBA (A) \n 0-5 \n 17 \n \n \n 2021/22 \n MUN (A) \n 0-2 \n 14 \n \n \n 2022/23 \n NFO (H) \n 6-0 \n 12 \n \n \n \n Cancelo is owned by more than a third of FPL managers.

        "text": "\n The 2015/16 Premier League season was undoubtedly one of the most memorable in its 30-year history, with\u00a0 Leicester City 's triumph one of the greatest sporting underdog stories. \n Having narrowly avoiding relegation in 2014/15, the Foxes shocked everyone by becoming champions the following campaign. \n But who were the players that wrote themselves into the history books, and where are they now? \n Kasper Schmeichel \n Following in the footsteps of his famous father  Peter Schmeichel , Kasper played a pivotal role in the Foxes' success. The Danish goalkeeper played every single minute of the campaign and kept 14 clean sheets. Schmeichel remained at Leicester for another six seasons, before departing in the summer of 2022 to French club Nice. \n Danny Simpson \n A product of  Manchester United 's Academy, Simpson spent five seasons at King Power Stadium, before joining Huddersfield Town in 2019. The right-back is currently plying his trade with Championship side Bristol City. \n Wes Morgan \n Captain Fantastic, Morgan's leadership was key to Leicester's historic triumph. He remained with the Foxes until he retired from football in 2021, lifting the FA Cup in his final season. He is now a member of the Premier League\u2019s Black Participants\u2019 Advisory Group. \n Robert Huth \n Huth left Leicester when his contract expired in the summer of 2018. Since hanging up his boots, the German has completed a Master of Science in Sports Directorship degree.\u00a0 \n Christian Fuchs \n The charismatic Austrian swapped Leicester for a move to Major League Soccer side Charlotte FC in 2021, taking in a loan spell at Charlotte Independence. Outside of football, Fuchs runs a public relations company and a football academy. \n Riyad Mahrez \n One of the star men in 2015/16, Mahrez departed for  Manchester City  in the summer of 2018. He has gone on to win a further three Premier League titles and was part of the side who finished runners-up in the 2020/21 UEFA Champions League. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Danny Drinkwater \n Another Man Utd Academy graduate, the midfielder found a home at Leicester following several loan spells. However, a transfer to  Chelsea  in 2017 yielded only 12 Premier League appearances and several loans. Drinkwater is currently a free agent. \n N'Golo Kante \n Arriving as an unknown quantity from French side Caen in 2015, Kante was a revelation in central midfield during his sole season at Leicester. He joined Chelsea in the summer of 2016 and picked up another Premier League winner's medal, while he has also won the Champions League and FA Cup. He helped France claim the 2018 FIFA World Cup. \n Marc Albrighton \n A terrific servant for Leicester, Albrighton is one of only two players from  Claudio Ranieri 's 2015/16 starting XI who is still with the club. He was part of the side who reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League a year later and lifted the FA Cup in 2021. \n Shinji Okazaki \n The perfect foil to  Jamie Vardy , the Japanese forward spent four seasons with Leicester before moving to Spain to play for Malaga, Huesca and most recently  Cartagena in the second tier. His contract expired this summer. \u00a0 \n Jamie Vardy \n Vardy's record-breaking campaign earned him the 2015/16 EA SPORTS Player of the Season award, as he memorably scored in 11 successive matches. Seven years on from his heroics, the striker is still going strong as the spearhead of Leicester's attack. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Leicester's title miracle Part 2:  How Ranieri masterminded Leicester's title miracle \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout's  panel of experts \u00a0reveal the players who have impressed them the most in pre-season ahead of the start of 2022/23  Fantasy Premier League . \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a38.0m) has been on fire in pre-season. Breaking free from Pep Guardiola's rigid system could see him become a prolific goalscorer. \n Darwin Nunez  (\u00a39.0m) looked very impressive when he came off the bench against  Manchester City  at the weekend. We saw with Diogo Jota (\u00a39.0m) last season that the centre-forward for  Liverpool  always gets plenty of chances. We will likely need Nunez in our teams soon. \n Pranil Sheth ( @Lateriser12 )\u00a0 \n Nunez  has emerged as a big target for me. Whenever he is on the pitch he tends to get a lot of big chances. \n Gabriel Martinelli  (\u00a36.0m) is locked in my team.  Arsenal  look very different and fresh. Martinelli's value looks too good to pass up. \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the \u00a3100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n Pras ( @Pras_fpl ) \n Kieran Trippier  (\u00a35.0m) continues to show what an asset he can be, getting two assists in a recent friendly.  Newcastle United  should improve defensively with the signings of Sven Botman (\u00a34.5m) and Nick Pope (\u00a35.0m), so there is potential for points at both ends. \n Martinelli  is normally clouded under the rotation-risk category, but he played a high number of minutes during pre-season with his rival Emile Smith Rowe (\u00a36.0m) still sidelined. Martinelli is a shoo-in for our teams at that price. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n Big chances seem to fall  Nunez 's way and after an impressive cameo in the Community Shield, I hope he starts  against Fulham  as I am strongly considering him for my Gameweek 1 team. \n At \u00a36.0m,  Martinelli  is incredible value and an affordable route into the Arsenal attack. He has shown good link-up already with fellow Brazil international Jesus. The double-up is on. \n Ben Crabtree\u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n Initially I was looking at just  Son Heung-min  (\u00a312.0m) from  Tottenham Hotspur  but the form of  Harry Kane  (\u00a311.5m) has meant he is also a top priority and I'll have both of them. Kane's ability to get double-figure returns is something I don't want to miss out on. \n Pedro Neto  (\u00a35.5m) is someone I needed to be convinced of. After such a serious injury and playing in a low-scoring team, I wasn't even tempted at first. However, given the affordability and a few goals in pre-season, he's worth a shot and helps to afford some big-hitters. \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n Jesus  looked to be kindly priced when the game launched, and seeing his pre-season form has made him a must-own for Fantasy managers, myself included! \n If  Neto  could emulate his form of 2020/21, and it certainly seems that way during pre-season, he looks like he can offer value. We could even see him play the \u201cfalse 9\u201d role in the absence of Raul Jimenez (\u00a37.0m).\u00a0 \n Don't forget the Gameweek 1 deadline is 18:30 BST on Friday 5 August. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Bailey is a bargain \n",

        "text": "\n With  Manchester City  and  Arsenal  both blanking in Gameweek 12 before embarking on kind schedules from Gameweek 13-16, The Scout's panel of  Fantasy Premier League  experts discuss their strategies. \n What the experts say \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n As someone who is planning to Wildcard ahead of Gameweek 13, my strategy with Man City and Arsenal players needs to be right. They have been so consistent, so I don't want to sell them until Blank Gameweek 12.  \n Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a38.0m) is now back at his starting price. This makes him an easy sell after Gameweek 11 as I will be able to bring him back on a Wildcard for the same price I am selling him. I will probably take a chance on someone like  Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang  (\u00a39.1m) in GW12 as he has a nice fixture  at Brentford . \n With  Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.2m),  Joao Cancelo  (\u00a37.3m) and  Gabriel Martinelli  (\u00a36.6m), I have money invested in them and will likely move them to my bench for the Blank, so I don't have to pay more to bring them back in again on my Wildcard the week after.  \n Wildcarding into GW13 should allow me to benefit from owning three Man City and three Arsenal players for their lovely run of fixtures up to the FIFA World Cup at a time when other managers will have had to sell their City and Arsenal players and likely have to take points hits to bring them back in, or go without. \n Kelly Somers\u00a0 ( @KellySomers ) \n As someone playing a Wildcard in GW13, I will be holding Haaland and Martinelli and benching them for the Blank. This is partly due to the number of transfers I have left to make ahead of Gameweek 12. However, it is also because managers should be conscious of how much money they have tied up in a player. \n I have been toying with the idea of removing Martinelli, but because I have owned him since GW1 he will cost more for me to buy back on Wildcard. Instead I will sell Jesus, but not because I want to, but because I haven't got as much money tied up in him and therefore can bring him back in more easily after GW12 on Wildcard.\u00a0 \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n Holding at least three of your City and Arsenal players is a good idea, particularly the ones that you would lose value on if you sold and will want back soon. Haaland, Cancelo and Martinelli will remain in my squad. However, I will likely look to sell  Kevin De Bruyne  (\u00a312.4m) with a plan to replace him with  Phil Foden  (\u00a38.2m) after Blank Gameweek 12. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Holding three or four players from City and Arsenal combined is perfectly fine, even if it means going into Blank Gameweek 12 with only 10 players. \n After the Blank, City and Arsenal's excellent fixtures to the FIFA World Cup mean holding these players through GW12 will allow managers to take advantage without needing to take points hits and precious transfers to bring them straight back in.\u00a0 \n Ben Crabtree\u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n I will be holding a total of three City and Arsenal players through Blank Gameweek 12.  \n I'm happy as long as I have 11 players, as cheaper players like  Andreas Pereira  (\u00a34.6m) can come off my bench and have the potential to deliver, as shown in a third of his appearances this season. None of the fixtures in GW12 make me want to sell any City players, especially as I will want them back after the Blank. \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n Keep Man City and Arsenal players this week ahead of the Blank. They are just too good right now!  \n When it comes to Blank GW12, hold those who you have most valued tied up in, which are likely to be Haaland and Martinelli. It's fine to keep three or four players you know you'll want back come GW13. \n Nick\u00a0( @WGTA_Nick ) \n I see no issue with benching three of Arsenal and City's players and giving the likes of Pereira a run-out  against Aston Villa .  \n If you sell your Arsenal and City players you will likely just be transferring them straight back in after their Blanks for matches  against Southampton  and  Brighton & Hove Albion  respectively. \n Geoff Dance\u00a0( @GeoffreyDance ) \n For managers who have played their Wildcard and want to capitalise on the fixtures for these two clubs in GW11 and GW13-16, they could consider playing the Free Hit chip in Blank Gameweek 12. Managers could hold their Arsenal and City players and add more to their team now, knowing they could then build a Free-Hit team to target the best fixtures in GW12 and have the Arsenal and Man City stars back for GW13.\u00a0 \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  GW10 Bonus points Part 2:  GW10 stats: Haaland breaks more records as he hits century Part 3:  Saturday review: Top midfielder Foden is No 1 target Part 4:\u00a0 GW10 Lessons: Prepare for Arsenal and Man City's Blank \n",

When he drifts infield, the Ukrainian creates overloads in central positions that confuse the opposition. \n Zinchenko is excellent at seeing a forward pass, and executing it with precision. His quality helps Arsenal play through the lines to consistently create promising attacks. \n Licence to roam \n Mikel Arteta , who worked with Zinchenko at Man City, hands his full-back licence to go wherever he sees fit when Arsenal have control of the ball. \n Zinchenko can occasionally pop up to the right of centre when linking play, but most of his distribution comes from a more orthodox left-central midfield berth. \n It is risky to some degree for him to leave his station at left-back, but  Gabriel ,  Granit Xhaka  or  Gabriel Martinelli  fill those holes when he goes for a wander. \n Fast transitions can sometimes leave Arsenal exposed, and this is something  Manchester United  may target at Emirates Stadium this Sunday. But the class that Zinchenko provides on the ball is a positive that outweighs that concern. \n Growing influence \n In Arsenal\u2019s last home match  against Newcastle United , Zinchenko produced a sublime distribution masterclass. \n He was the most effective Arsenal player when it came to breaching a well-disciplined  Newcastle  shape, feeding a string of forward passes between midfielders for Xhaka. \n How Zinchenko found Xhaka (v NEW) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Zinchenko's hybrid role allows Xhaka to push into attacking-midfield positions, which asks questions of his direct markers. \n In the absence of defensive midfielder  Casemiro , who is suspended, Man Utd's central midfielders must get their positional spacing right. \n Whenever Zinchenko gains possession on the inside, he can cut through their unit with a single incisive pass. \n Zinchenko influence per 90 2022/23 \n \n \n \n Succ. passes into final third \n Successful passes in opp. half \n \n \n \n \n Zinchenko \n 18.9 \n Zinchenko \n 34.3 \n \n \n Odegaard \n 16.8 \n Partey \n 33.9 \n \n \n Xhaka \n 16.7 \n White \n 28.7 \n \n \n \n *minimum 10 starts \n Over this season Zinchenko has averaged 4.7 progressive passes per 90 minutes, but in recent weeks that figure has been far higher. \n Pass master \n He makes more successful passes in to the opposition half or final third than any team-mate, and it will be fascinating to see if Man Utd head coach  Erik ten Hag  has devised a plan to curb his influence. \n Without Casemiro it would be a surprise if Ten Hag did not deploy a midfield trio of  Fred ,  Scott McTominay  and  Christian Eriksen . \n Those three would ordinarily be directly responsible for  Thomas Partey , Xhaka and Odegaard, but Zinchenko's forays infield will pose difficult questions. \n If United do not find a way to nullify his distribution, Arsenal are likely to enjoy control of this match. \n Zinchenko has become a prominent and highly influential figure in this table-topping team. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 Mudryk offers quick answer to Chelsea's goal-shy attack Part 3:  How Bentancur balances Spurs' defence and attack \n",

        "text": "\n With several expensive defenders struggling for big returns, The Scout's panel of  Fantasy Premier League  experts debate if it is time to go with cheaper alternatives, such as  William Saliba (\u00a35.0m) , the only defender among the 13 highest-scoring players in FPL.\u00a0 \n What the experts say \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n I wouldn't clear out all your premium defenders. Under Graham Potter,  Reece James (\u00a36.0m)  can get double-digit hauls.  Joao Cancelo (\u00a37.2m) , too. But, I wouldn't back  Liverpool  for clean sheets for the next two weeks. So if you\u2019ve got  Trent Alexander-Arnold (\u00a37.3m) , he's probably a sell, given he's not producing the attacking returns either. Keep:  James, Cancelo Sell:  Alexander-Arnold \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n I still think the likes of James and Cancelo offer excellent potential at both ends.  Kieran Trippier (\u00a35.5m)  is also offering premium-defender potential at a fraction of the price and has many routes to points even without clean sheets. Keep:  James, Cancelo, Trippier Sell:  Liverpool defenders \n Ben Crabtree\u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n \"Big at the back\" isn't dead, it's sleeping. Teams challenging for something at the run-in tend to tighten up. It only takes Liverpool to sort their defence out and you have Alexander-Arnold plus  Andrew Robertson (\u00a36.7m)  becoming two of the best-value players in the game. Don't pick four expensive defenders now, but don't rule it out for later in the season. Keep:  Some premium defenders \n Sam Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n As someone who doubled up on the  Manchester City  defence, the era of investing heavily in defence is coming to an end. This in part is due to the lack of clean sheets this season, but also to do with the attacking assets.  \n Normally, I like to invest in the City defence for the clean sheets. However,  Ederson (\u00a35.5m)  is only the fifth-highest scoring goalkeeper and while Cancelo is the second-highest scoring defender, by not owning either, I can use my precious City spots for their attacking assets who are scoring goals for fun. This theory is strengthened by Cancelo having only scored one point more than Trippier but being \u00a31.7m more expensive. Sell:  Ederson, Cancelo \n Paul Gee ( @FpLPaulGee ) \n This year we need to be flexible. Liverpool's defence at the moment looks terrible. However, Cancelo, Trippier and James   are all must picks at the moment. So I'd say two or three premiums is a must, but be prepared for more, especially when Liverpool's fixtures change for the better and when Man City blank in Gameweek 12. Keep:  James, Cancelo, Trippier \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n James and Cancelo   will prove exceptional FPL assets this season. We haven't seen too many clean sheets from last season's top four, but I expect that to change soon. Keep:  James, Cancelo \n Pras ( @Pras_fpl ) \n We should not be knee-jerking and ejecting some of the best players in the game. Yes, Liverpool and specifically Alexander-Arnold look defensively suspect, but James, Trippier and Cancelo   still offer a fantastic route to points at both ends of the pitch . \n  Moreover, we need to think about team structure. If there were budget constraints, for example if a manager wanted to go three premium players, there is merit to this budget-defenders strategy. At the moment one or two premium defenders is optimal. Keep:  James, Cancelo, Trippier Sell:  Alexander-Arnold \n Jamie Pigott ( @Futbolislifefpl ) \n \"Big at the back\" isn't fully dead but there's a middle ground to find.  \n It's certainly getting more difficult to justify Alexander-Arnold. But I like using a smaller portion of my transfers on defenders. So James, Cancelo, Trippier all still offer great value, can return at both ends and are set-and-forget options. With  Erling Haaland (\u00a312.2m)  the standout captaincy option most weeks, there's less reason to shoehorn a second or third premium player, leaving us with plenty of budget to invest in defence. Keep:  James, Cancelo, Trippier Sell:  Alexander-Arnold \n",

His 24-pointer in this fixture from was a real FPL highlight from last season, so I'll likely go with him or  Haaland  for captaincy.  \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @Zophar666 ) \n Manchester City  have scored more goals in home matches than any other side and so \u00a0Haaland  remains the standout captain pick. Alternatively,  Kane  away to Fulham is a great shout. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n if we're looking away from \u00a0Haaland , which managers should consider, I like  Kane  for the armband this week. Whilst Fulham are playing well at the moment, they will concede chances. \n Ben Crabtree\u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n I'm torn between \u00a0Haaland  and \u00a0De Bruyne  for the captaincy this week. I would like to go De Bruyne because he is likely to produce a large return imminently. \n Nick Harris ( @WGTA_Nick ) \n Kane  could be an excellent alternative captaincy to  Haaland  this weekend. He has 15 goals to his name this season and needs just two to get to 200 goals in the Premier League and break Jimmy Greaves' all time Spurs record. \n",

Here are some of the patterns that have emerged. \n Clinical difference \n As you might expect, Haaland boasts the most clinical shot-conversion rate among the top five goalscorers. \n The Norwegian has not attempted as many shots as  Harry Kane  (12 goals) or  Aleksandar Mitrovic  (nine goals), but when chances fall his way, he is exceptionally clinical and that has set him apart. \n Haaland's goal v Brighton \n \n \n \ud83e\udd1d The assist \ud83d\udcaa The strength \ud83e\udd29 The finish Erling Haaland's opener had everything! \ud83d\udc4a #ManCity   pic.twitter.com/GiGwtn84pT \n\u2014 Manchester City (@ManCity)  October 22, 2022 \n \n Haaland's 41.86 per cent success rate from shots is way in advance of last season's most accurate finisher,  Son Heung-min , who scored 23 times for  Tottenham Hotspur  at a conversion rate of 33.3 per cent. \n When the Man City forward hits the target, those strikes invariably beat the goalkeeper. From 28 efforts on target, he has scored 18 times. \n Best conversion-rate comparison 2022/23 \n \n \n \n Conversion rate % (excl. blocks) \n Big-chance conversion rate % \n \n \n \n \n Erling Haaland \n 41.86 \n Rodrigo \n 77.78 \n \n \n Rodrigo \n 34.62 \n Erling Haaland \n 66.67 \n \n \n Harry Kane \n 30.00 \n Harry Kane \n 62.50 \n \n \n Ivan Toney \n 27.00 \n Aleksandar Mitrovic \n 46.15 \n \n \n Aleksandar Mitrovic \n 20.00 \n Ivan Toney \n 42.11 \n \n \n \n Leeds United  star\u00a0 Rodrigo , who has produced nine goals, is certainly worthy of high praise in this department. \n His 34.62 per cent strike rate for Leeds is excellent and of the current top five in the goal charts, he dispatches the highest number of big chances, too (77.78 per cent). \n The only player in his group not to have scored more than one penalty, Rodrigo has been razor sharp this season. \n Kane improvement \n It is also worth noting that Kane can put the disappointment of England's FIFA World Cup 2022 exit behind him knowing that his finishing has been terrific for Spurs. \n He has scored with 30 per cent of his efforts this term, compared to 17.53 per cent in 2021/22. \n All the division's leading scorers are exceeding their Expected Goals (xG) figures. \n According to Opta, Haaland should only have scored 8.69 non-penalty goals so far, a figure he has more than doubled in reality as a result of his ruthless shooting. \n Rodrigo and Kane are the next two most impressive performers in this regard, scoring three more goals than anticipated. \n Expected-goals comparison 2022/23 \n \n \n \n Player \n Non-penalty xG \n Goals (exc. pens) \n Difference \n \n \n \n \n Haaland \n 8.69 \n 15 \n 9.31 \n \n \n Kane \n 7.08 \n 10 \n 2.92 \n \n \n Toney \n 5.69 \n 7 \n 1.31 \n \n \n Rodrigo \n 4.70 \n 8 \n 3.30 \n \n \n Mitrovic \n 4.65 \n 6 \n 1.35 \n \n \n \n Who has the most varied finishing? \n All five of these leading scorers have been a threat in the air. \n Getting on the end of crosses, Haaland, Kane, Mitrovic, Rodrigo and  Ivan Toney  have netted a recorded 15 headed goals between them so far. \n Surprisingly,  Brentford 's 10-goal Toney, a player who wins an extraordinary number of aerial duels, is the only member of this select group not to have scored three headers. \n Kane has five to his name, anticipating flick-ons and the flight of the ball expertly during the early stages of this campaign. \n Haaland and Rodrigo score the bulk of their goals with their left foot, while Mitrovic and Toney are predominantly right-footed. \n Goals breakdown 2022/23 \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n Left \n Right \n Head \n In box \n Out. box \n \n \n \n \n Haaland \n 12 \n 3 \n 3 \n 17 \n 1 \n \n \n Kane* \n 1 \n 5 \n 5 \n 11 \n 1 \n \n \n Toney \n 1 \n 8 \n 1 \n 8 \n 2 \n \n \n Rodrigo \n 5 \n 1 \n 3 \n 9 \n 0 \n \n \n Mitrovic \n 0 \n 6 \n 3 \n 9 \n 0 \n \n \n \n * Excludes one of Kane's goals off his shoulder Time will tell whether Haaland can sustain his strike rate, which has been outlandish considering he is new to English football. \n And even if he does not maintain this incredible run of form, he is well on course to exceed the 30-goal mark. \n Best minutes per goal 2022/23 \n \n \n \n Player \n Mins per goal \n \n \n \n \n Haaland \n 57.83 \n \n \n Rodrigo \n 99.22 \n \n \n Mitrovic \n 99.22 \n \n \n Toney \n 126 \n \n \n \n Nobody else at the top end of the goal charts comes close to matching him right now, but Kane is the most likely contender to push Haaland for the Golden Boot. \n If the Norway international sustains an injury that keeps him out for an extended period, Kane looks best equipped to maintain his goal rate. \n Mitrovic, Toney and Rodrigo have all been very productive, but playing for teams currently sat in the bottom half of the table, it looks like it will be more difficult for them to sustain a season-long challenge for top-scoring honours. \n Mohamed Salah  (six goals) and  Darwin Nunez  (five), are both capable of putting fantastic goalscoring runs together, but it looks like they have too much ground to make up. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  Why Pope and Ramsdale lead race for Golden Glove Part 3:  Why De Bruyne is clear leader for Playmaker award \n",

However, I do think  Callum Wilson  (\u00a37.5m), who is  expected to overcome a minor illness , will be in the hunt to topple the Norwegian. The  Newcastle United  forward has returned 24 points in his last two Gameweeks and registered nine points the last time he played against Gameweek 15  opponents Southampton  in 2021/22 Fantasy. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n Manchester City  have the best fixture this week,  at home to Fulham , and  Kevin De Bruyne's  (\u00a312.5m) potential for a big score is huge. He is arguably the standout captain pick this week with doubts around  Haaland . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n Man City look good for a clean sheet this weekend. I predict  Joao Cancelo  (\u00a37.4m) will add an attacking return to a shutout in a comfortable win for last season's champions. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Southampton  have only scored four goals in their last eight matches. This means a clean sheet could be on the cards for Newcastle and  Kieran Tripper  (\u00a35.9m). The England international has more than enough attacking threat about him too, so aside from the Man City attackers, I'll back him. \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n De Bruyne  could blow  Fulham  away this weekend. I am fearful of the points he's likely to deliver as a non-owner. He has goals in consecutive outings and is dominant for key passes and chances created this season. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n I can't see past the Man City fixture where there is a high ceiling for all attacking players on the pitch.  De Bruyne  has been benched in the last couple of Champions League contests and looks fresh and ready to deliver again in the Premier League. \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n With  Chelsea hosting Arsenal  and  Liverpool visiting Tottenham Hotspur , the captaincy will come from Man City. If  Haaland  isn't fit then  De Bruyne ,  Julian Alvarez  (\u00a36.0m) or  Phil Foden  (\u00a38.5m) are all good options. Of these, De Bruyne seems the standout given he got a midweek rest. \n GW15 deadline: 13:30 GMT, Sat 5 Nov \n See:  Your essential FPL tips for Gameweek 15 \n",

        "text": "\n Since the start of the season, managers in  Fantasy Premier League  have been talking about the end of \"big at the back\", where their initial investment in high-priced defenders failed to pay off and led to a shifting of funds into other positions. \n But our exclusive research of FPL teams this season in fact shows that while expensive defenders such as Trent Alexander-Arnold (\u00a37.2m) and Reece James (\u00a35.8m) have dropped in popularity, managers have not significantly reduced their spend in their backline. \n Instead, funds have been shifted more from midfield to the forward line. \n Average spent per position 2022/23 \n \n \n \n Position \n GW1 \n GW10 \n GW16 \n \n \n \n \n GKP \n \u00a39.4m \n \u00a39.5m \n \u00a39.4m \n \n \n DEF \n \u00a327.7m \n \u00a327.0m \n \u00a327.0m \n \n \n MID \n \u00a338.2m \n \u00a336.7m \n \u00a336.8m \n \n \n FWD \n \u00a324.3m \n \u00a326.4m \n \u00a326.6m \n \n \n \n As the table above shows, the average spend on goalkeepers this season has stayed fairly consistent. \n And it is true that FPL managers have been cutting back on their defence. At the start of the campaign managers averaged a \u00a327.7m spend on defenders, but this dropped to \u00a327.0m by Gameweek 16.\u00a0 \n However, it is from midfield where the greatest reduction in funds has taken place. After managers initially invested an average of \u00a338.2m in midfielders, by Gameweek 16 this figure was down by \u00a31.4m.\u00a0 \n How have you spent your budget? \n There has been a general move away from premium midfielders like Mohamed Salah (\u00a312.8m), who were not delivering value for money. The Liverpool midfielder's ownership stood at 4.8m in Gameweek 4 but slumped to just under 3.5m by Gameweek 16. \n Won over by the brilliance of high-returning budget midfielders, FPL managers instead turned to the likes of Miguel Almiron (\u00a35.8m) and Leandro Trossard (\u00a37.1m), whose ownership increased respectively from 108,734 and 177,238 in Gameweek 1 to 3.6m and 3.0m in Gameweek 16. \n The ownership of Gabriel Martinelli (\u00a36.8m) also soared from 1.7m to 5.3m. \n Salah's ownership v budget midfielders \n \n \n \n Player \n GW1 \n GW10 \n GW16 \n \n \n \n \n Salah \n 4.8m (\u00a313.0m) \n 4.3m (\u00a312.7m) \n 3.5m (\u00a312.8m) \n \n \n Almiron \n 108,734 (\u00a35.0m) \n 700,811 (\u00a35.2m) \n 3.6m (\u00a35.8m) \n \n \n Martinelli \n 1.7m (\u00a36.0m) \n 5.2m (\u00a36.6m) \n 5.3m (\u00a36.8m) \n \n \n Trossard \n 177,238 (\u00a36.5m) \n 2.8m (\u00a36.9m) \n 3.0m (\u00a37.1m) \n \n \n \n Investment in the frontline has seen the most significant uplift, with managers prepared to spend on average \u00a32.3m more on forwards in Gameweek 16 than at the start of the season. \n The extraordinary feats of Erling Haaland (\u00a312.2m) certainly played their part. As the  Manchester City  star set goalscoring records in the opening Gameweeks, his ownership skyrocketed from 3.4m to 9.0m. \n Ownership of most-popular forwards \n \n \n \n Player \n GW1 \n GW10 \n GW16 \n \n \n \n \n Haaland \n 3.4m (\u00a311.5m) \n 9.0m (\u00a312.2m) \n 9.0m (\u00a312.2m) \n \n \n Kane \n 2.3m (\u00a311.5m) \n 2.2m (\u00a311.4m) \n 2.8m (\u00a311.6m) \n \n \n Jesus \n 6.0m (\u00a38.0m) \n 7.3m (\u00a38.0m) \n 6.4m (\u00a38.0m) \n \n \n \n Fellow premium forward Harry Kane (\u00a311.6m) has also enjoyed an ownership hike.

        "summary": "The Scout's panel discuss their plans for the period ahead of the FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "\n With the likes of Phil Foden (\u00a38.1m) and Leandro Trossard (\u00a36.7m) outperforming popular picks such as Mohamed Salah (\u00a312.8m), Luis Diaz (\u00a38.2m) and Gabriel Martinelli (\u00a36.6m), The Scout's panel of  Fantasy Premier League  experts reveal their midfield plans. \n What the experts say \n Sam Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n I'm keen to stay invested with a heavy front three, so finding value in the midfield is key. Players like  James Maddison  (\u00a38.0m) and \u00a0Foden \u00a0are great value, and even with  Martinelli  not quite hitting the heights of the early part of the season, he is ticking over the points and passing the eye test.  \n Rodrigo  (\u00a36.3m) has made his first start since Gameweek 5, getting the nod instead of Patrick Bamford (\u00a37.3m), and is now low owned. With  Leeds United  facing  Crystal Palace ,  Leicester City \u00a0and\u00a0 Fulham \u00a0in three of their next four fixtures, he could be a good differential.  Leandro Trossard \u00a0likewise, given the new, more attacking  Brighton & Hove Albion  system.\u00a0 \n Ben Crabtree\u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n If struggling for midfield picks, a change of formation to only play three is an option. I'm looking to attack the fixtures, still playing four with  Maddison ,  Wilfried Zaha  (\u00a37.3m)\u00a0and  Raheem Sterling  (\u00a310.0m) in my team, and  Jarrod Bowen  (\u00a38.1m) maybe coming in soon. \n Pranil Sheth ( @Lateriser12 ) \n Despite their blank in Gameweek 12,  Manchester City  are simply the best attack in the league. They are head and shoulders above the rest.  Foden  is my favourite in this midfield spot. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n The mid-priced midfielder bracket is tricky to navigate right now. Despite Leicester's malaise, Maddison has the fixtures to find some form, as do  Zaha  and  Bowen , with the latter looking to build on his haul from Gameweek 9.  \n I would stick with  Martinelli  despite his upcoming Blank Gameweek.  Liverpool  are conceding lots of big chances and then the Brazilian faces Leeds. I'll likely just bench him for Blank Gameweek 12. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n The mid-priced midfielder bracket is perking up and several good picks are emerging, like  Bowen ,  Zaha ,  Foden  and  Maddison . With Erling Haaland (\u00a312.1m) being the default captain, it might be wise to spread the funds around with these midfielders, rather than go for a second premium. \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n I'm a very happy  Kevin De Bruyne  (\u00a312.3m) owner but I've had my head turned by  Foden 's derby performance. I'm now considering losing Joao Cancelo (\u00a37.2m) to get on an attacking Man City triple-up. \n Nick ( @WGTA_Nick )\u00a0 \n Managers who went against the grain with picks like Foden, Trossard\u00a0and Bowen have been rewarded. These players have shown they have the potential to score big in any Gameweek.  Sterling  at  Chelsea  is one player I've been keeping an eye on, and with some great fixtures coming up he could be an excellent Salah   replacement. \n Part 1:\u00a0 GW9 FPL stats: Haaland repays record number of managers Part 2:\u00a0 GW9 Bonus points Part 3:\u00a0 FPL Saturday review: Bowen finds form ahead of kind run Part 4:\u00a0 GW9 Lessons: Foden can lead midfield refresh \n",

        "text": "\n Wayne Rooney's outrageous overhead kick  against Manchester City  in 2010/11 is one of the Premier League's most iconic goals.\u00a0 \n Here are a further five stunning efforts by former  Everton  and  Manchester United  Hall of Fame inductee  Rooney , the competition's second-highest goalscorer behind  Alan Shearer . \n Everton v Arsenal, 2002 \n When 16-year-old Rooney was introduced as an 80th minute substitute for  Tomasz Radzinski  against reigning champions  Arsenal , few at a packed Goodison Park could have imagined the drama to follow. \n The teenager beautifully controlled  Lee Carsley 's hopeful forward punt, and as the Arsenal defenders backed off, Rooney curled a sensational strike in off the crossbar past  David Seaman . \n 'Remember the name!' shouted the TV commentator - and remember it we did! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Man Utd v Newcastle, 2005 \n Rooney was getting increasingly frustrated as nothing he tried was coming off and Man Utd were trailing just before the hour-mark. \n He had just spoken to referee Neale Barry and was running alongside the official when the ball dropped invitingly. With one swing of the boot Rooney connected, hitting a ferocious first-time volley that swerved into the top corner. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Man Utd v Bolton, 2007 \n From start to finish, this mesmerising 10 seconds of speed, skill and vision is counter-attacking football at its finest. \n In a move that began from a Bolton throw-in,  Cristiano Ronaldo  gained possession on the edge of his own area and immediately released it to Rooney. The England striker returned the favour, allowing Ronaldo to embark on a surging 60-yard run through the middle before feeding the advancing Rooney, who delicately flicked over the advancing  Jussi Jaaskelainen . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n West Ham v Man Utd, 2014 \n After using his trademark strength to shrug off\u00a0 James Tomkins \u00a0just inside the  West Ham United \u00a0half, Rooney swivelled on the bouncing ball and struck a fierce half-volley. \n With goalkeeper  Adrian  off his line, the ball looped over the scrambling Hammers goalkeeper and took one bounce before flying into the roof of the net. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Everton v West Ham, 2017 \n He may have modestly described it as \"a nice goal\", but this spectacular effort was reminiscent of  David Beckham 's audacious strike from the halfway line against Wimbledon in 1996. \n With the ball travelling at speed from goalkeeper  Joe Hart \u2019s clearance, Rooney showed incredible technique and from barely five yards inside  West Ham 's half, propelled the ball perfectly over the despairing jumps of  Winston Reid  and  Cheikhou Kouyate  and into the back of an empty net. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  PL30: Rooney - Out of this world Part 2:\u00a0 PL30: Poll: What is the best-ever Premier League goal? \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at tactical trends from the 2022/23 season so far.\u00a0 \n Crosses and headers \n Over the last 20 years there has been a steady decline in the number of crosses. \n Back in 2003/04, when it was common to see two forwards up front, there was\u00a0an average of 42 crosses per match. \n But natural wingers and strike partnerships have fallen out of fashion, and this season there have been just 23.8 crosses per fixture, a record low. \n While using the width of the pitch to attack down the wings will always be a key tactic, there is far less inclination to deliver hopeful aerial balls. \n Instead, most managers now encourage a more precise and selective approach, and this is reflected in the success rate of crosses this term. \n In what is a 16-year high, 22 per cent of deliveries from wide areas have reached their intended targets. \n So has that led to an increased share of headed goals? Quite the opposite.\u00a0Only 14.3 per cent of strikes have come from headers this season, the second-lowest quota recorded. \n Clinical finishing \n The standard of finishing in the Premier League has never been higher. \n Helped by the quality of the forwards across the 20 clubs, there has been a noticeable rise in shots hitting the target. \n The best numbers for shooting accuracy all come from the last five years. \n Top seasons for conversion and accuracy \n \n \n \n Best conversion \n Best shooting accuracy\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n 2022/23 \n 11.4% \n 2022/23 \n 49.5% \n \n \n 2020/21 \n 11.1% \n 2020/21 \n 48.9% \n \n \n 2018/19 \n 11.1% \n 2021/22 \n 48.1% \n \n \n 2021/22 \n 11.0% \n 2019/20 \n 47.8% \n \n \n \n In addition, chance-conversion rates are the best we have seen with an average 11.4% of goals from shots, including blocked efforts, this season. \n Erling Haaland \u2019s remarkable start to the season has certainly helped to inflate those figures. \n Of all the players to have scored at least five Premier League goals this term,  Manchester City \u2019s superstar leads the way with the best conversion rate. \n Most efficient players 2022/23 \n \n \n \n Player \n Goals \n Conversion \n \n \n \n \n Erling Haaland \n 18 \n 34.6% \n \n \n Pascal Gross \n 5 \n 29.4% \n \n \n Phil Foden \n 7 \n 25.9% \n \n \n Ivan Toney \n 10 \n 24.4% \n \n \n Rodrigo \n 9 \n 23.1% \n \n \n \n In news that will please football supporters who enjoy the physical side of the game, tackling is also on the rise. \n In 2020/21 there was an all-time low of just 31.1 tackles per 90 minutes, down from a high of 47.5 in 2006/07 when records began. \n But across the last two campaigns there has been a bounce-back. Last term the average stood at 32.7, and this season it has climbed further to 34.1. \n A more lenient approach from referees, with a well-publicised increase in the threshold for awarding a foul, appears to have encouraged more physicality. \n Interestingly, this increase has not resulted in more red cards. \n Indeed, only 12 players have been sent off this season, putting us on course for around 31 dismissals by the end of the campaign. \n In the previous two seasons there have been 43 and 48 red cards. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Back fours on the rise Part 2:  Home wins close to a record high Part 3:  Corner variety increases goal threat \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout\u2019s  panel of experts  discuss their plans for Erling Haaland (\u00a312.2m) replacements in  Fantasy Premier League , if the  Manchester City \u00a0striker is ruled out of Gameweek 14. \n See:  What to do with Haaland in FPL? \n What the experts say \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n With Haaland currently a doubt for Gameweek 14 this might be the week to hand the armband to someone different. I fancy  Darwin Nunez  (\u00a38.8m) to continue his goalscoring from the UEFA Champions League and can see him and  Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a38.0m) as this week\u2019s top scorers. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Lots of candidates for Gameweek 14's top points scorer and with Haaland possibly a doubt, the field opens up a bit. I'll back  Wilfried Zaha  (\u00a37.6m) to do well  at home to Southampton . With five goal involvements at home already this season, he and  Crystal Palace  certainly like their home comforts more than they do an away day. \n Lateriser ( @lateriser12 ) \n Leeds United  are there for the taking and it is the kind of match that suits  Liverpool  in my opinion.  Mohamed Salah  (\u00a312.8m) should get some points here and I expect  Nunez  to not be far behind. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n I am backing Liverpool to bounce back after their  loss to Nottingham Forest , they are still a very strong team at Anfield and Leeds look a bit out of sorts. Both  Salah  and  Nunez  are excellent options this week. \n Paul Gee\u00a0( @FPLPaulGee ) \n Leeds are in turmoil at the moment. Jesse Marsch is a shadow of his old self and the players are demoralised. So I predict  Patrick Bamford  (\u00a37.2m) to be the highest points scorer! \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n With or without Haaland, I'm still looking at Man City's  trip to Leicester City . I expect  Phil Foden  (\u00a38.5m) and  Kevin De Bruyne  (\u00a312.3m) to have big Gameweeks off the back of each having a rest in Man City's previous two fixtures. \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n I am going with  Arsenal  to bounce back at Emirates Stadium and put a few past the  Nottingham Forest  defence.  Jesus  has been threatening the goal without much output recently. I am backing him to come good on Sunday. \n Jamie Pigott\u00a0 ( @Futbolislifefpl ) \n Both  Nunez  and  Salah  are options depending on who gets more of the chances. I'll back Salah, he played more centrally in midweek. Expect him to be motivated and more involved. \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n Salah  has an excellent record against Leeds, who are struggling defensively at the moment. Liverpool have impressed at Anfield this season, so the stars could align for a big score again this weekend. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n Although Forest have improved in defence, they\u2019ve been lucky not to have conceded more. I expect Arsenal to bounce back from their European defeat and  Gabriel Martinelli  (\u00a36.8m) to be the top scorer with a brace. \n Nick ( @WGTA_Nick )\u00a0\u00a0 \n Salah  hasn\u2019t been in his finest form this season but I am really fancying him at home to Leeds, who he has previously scored six goals against in four appearances. \n GW14 deadline: 11:00 BST, Sat 29 Oct \n",

        "text": "\n After being booked in  Leicester City's 0-0 draw against\u00a0Crystal Palace  on Saturday, James Maddison (\u00a38.3m) will now miss the Foxes' Gameweek 12 match  at home to\u00a0Leeds United  on Thursday.\u00a0 \n Our panel of  Fantasy Premier League  experts are on hand to reveal their top targets to replace the  Leicester  midfielder. \n What the experts say \n Sam Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n Leandro Trossard  (\u00a36.9m) is my preferred replacement.  Brighton & Hove Albion face Nottingham Forest  in Gameweek 12 and the Belgian is top across the Expected Goal (xG) statistics for the Seagulls. \n Geoff Dance\u00a0( @GeoffreyDance ) \n Mason Mount  (\u00a37.7m) has produced both of his best points hauls this season in Chelsea\u2019s last two matches, scoring twice and supplying two assists. He looks a key figure for the Blues under Graham Potter.\u00a0 \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n It never rains it pours in Fantasy - if we didn't have enough to deal with for Blank Gameweek 12, Maddison gets himself suspended. \n I'll be selling him and bringing in  Trossard  from Brighton or one of the  Newcastle United  midfielders,  Miguel Almiron  (\u00a35.2m) or  Bruno Guimaraes  (\u00a35.7m). \n See:\u00a0 How to navigate Arsenal and Man City's Blank \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n Brighton  have the standout fixture in Gameweek 12 so I would go for  Trossard , especially if you already own  Wilfried Zaha  (\u00a37.5m). Almiron is also worth a look, as Newcastle are very attacking at home. \n Holly Shand\u00a0( @HollyShand ) \n With three of the next four fixtures tricky after his ban, I'm leaning towards selling Maddison for  Trossard . \n Nick ( @WGTA_Nick )\u00a0\u00a0 \n I have a challenge now as I am down to only eight starters for Gameweek 12. I'm looking to bring back  Mohamed Salah  (\u00a312.7m) for the next couple of Gameweeks and am hoping his low ownership makes him something of a differential. \n Maddison is a sell for me to allow me to increase my playing numbers. \n Pras ( @Pras_fpl ) \n It couldn't have been a worse Gameweek for Maddison to get the one-match ban. With benches already filled with  Manchester City \u00a0and  Arsenal  players and other injured players such as  Reece James  (\u00a36.0m) to deal with, Maddison is a clear sell. \n As a like-for-like replacement,  Trossard ,  Zaha  or  Harvey Barnes  (\u00a36.9m) are the three I would look at. \n Jamie Pigott ( @Futbolislifefpl ) \n Maddison is an easy sell. After the suspension, Leicester have three away fixtures and a  home meeting with Man City . I like  Trossard  as a replacement this week at home to  Nottingham Forest . \n If you already have him, though, the Gameweek 12 match-ups aren't very enticing, but you can look ahead and prepare for good upcoming fixture runs for Man City, Arsenal,  Tottenham Hotspur  and  Liverpool  in Gameweeks 13-16. \n GW12 deadline: 18:00 BST, Tue 18 Oct \n Also in this series\u00a0 \n Part 1:\u00a0 GW12 Ones to watch: Salah surges back into the spotlight Part 2: \u00a0 GW12 Differentials: Guehi provides value solution Part 3:\u00a0 Scout Selection: Best FPL team for Gameweek 12 Part 5:  The FPL Pod: Best options for the Man City and Arsenal blank Part 6:  FPL experts: Who to captain in Gameweek 12 Part 7:  GW12 Captains: Zaha can extend home run \n",

The Frenchman produced a goal, three assists and 22 points in his previous two appearances. \n Newcastle are also poised for a favourable run of fixtures before the World Cup, with five of their next seven scoring a mere two in the FDR. \n Youri Tielemans (LEI) \u00a36.3m \n His  converted spot-kick against Tottenham Hotspur in Gameweek 8  highlighted the  Leicester City  midfielder's improving prospects in Fantasy.\u00a0 \n Tielemans is the Foxes' first-choice penalty taker when  Jamie Vardy  (\u00a39.2m) is not on the pitch and the latter has fallen out of the first XI recently, playing only 18 and 16 minutes in the last two matches.\u00a0 \n The Belgian has also impressed creatively, his 12 key passes second only to the 13 of  James Maddison  (\u00a37.9m) for the Foxes.\u00a0 \n His all-round potential suggests Tielemans could prove a budget-friendly route into the Foxes attack for a kind upcoming schedule. \n Six of their next seven matches score just two in the FDR. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 Sa can challenge Pope for No 1 spot Part 2:\u00a0 Tarkowski can outscore Patterson Part 3:  Set-piece threat raises Dier prospects Part 5:  Maddison's value offers greater appeal Part 6:  Toney an all-round prospect Part 7:\u00a0 Kane merits premium spot next to Haaland \n",

        "text": "\n Since the Premier League's inception in 1992, several legendary teams have graced the competition. But who have been the best? \n From  Manchester United 's dominance in the '90s and  Arsenal 's Invincibles through to  Manchester City 's modern-day supremacy, we take a look at six of the contenders. You can vote for the best team in the poll below. \n Man Utd (1998-01) \n Sir Alex Ferguson 's side dominated the 1990s and became the first team to win three consecutive Premier League titles, in  1998/99 ,  1999/2000  and  2000/01 . The first of that trio was their Treble-winning season. \n With their famous Class of '92 supporting a fearsome strike quartet of  Andy Cole ,  Dwight Yorke ,  Ole Gunnar Solskjaer  and  Teddy Sheringham , Man Utd won the Premier League, UEFA Champions League and FA Cup. They remain the only team to lift all three trophies in the same season.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Arsenal (2003/04) \n Arsene Wenger 's team achieved a unique feat of their own as they went through the entire season unbeaten to win the  2003/04  title. \n Talisman  Thierry Henry  won both the Premier League Golden Boot and Player of the Season awards, ably supported by  Dennis Bergkamp ,  Robert Pires  and  Patrick Vieira  among others as the Gunners finished 11 points ahead of runners-up  Chelsea . \n Chelsea (2004-06) \n Jose Mourinho  arrived at Stamford Bridge and immediately built the Premier League's best-ever defence, constructed around  Petr Cech ,  John Terry  and  Ricardo Carvalho . \n The Blues conceded only 15 goals in  2004/05  and kept 24 clean sheets, which remain Premier League records. They lost only one match en route to the 2004/05 title, which they won by 12 points, and then retained the crown the  following season . \n Man Utd (2006-09) \n Now with  Wayne Rooney  leading the line, the Red Devils again won three successive titles in  2006/07 ,  2007/08  and  2008/09 , with  Cristiano Ronaldo  helping them to add the UEFA Champions League in the second of those seasons.\u00a0\u00a0 \n They were tight at the back thanks to  Rio Ferdinand ,  Nemanja Vidic  and co, keeping 14 successive clean sheets in 2008/09, the best-ever run. \n Man City (2017-19) \n Pep Guardiola 's side made history of their own in  2017/18  as they became the first team to reach 100 points. \n With  Sergio Aguero ,  Kevin De Bruyne ,  Raheem Sterling ,  David Silva  and  Leroy Sane  joining forces, Man City scored 106 goals - another record - before finishing with 98 points in  2018/19  to pip  Liverpool  and make it back-to-back titles. \n Liverpool (2019/20) \n It needed a special team to finish ahead of City, and the Reds produced something special indeed in  2019/20  to beat their rivals by 18 points and secure their first Premier League title. \n Mohamed Salah ,  Virgil van Dijk  and their team-mates helped the Reds to equal Premier League records by winning 18 consecutive matches and 32 overall. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 PL30: Arsene Wenger's Invincibles Part 2:  PL30: Test your knowledge on Arsenal's Invincibles \n",

Some will be back with their reputations enhanced after starring on the global stage. Others have suffered heartbreak with their nations. \n Who will immediately hit top form after a short time back with their team-mates and who will need a little more time? How will managers handle their squads? All will be revealed in the coming days. \n See:  World Cup club player tracker \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Players taking the knee \n Premier League players will use the matches from 26-28 December as one of their dedicated match rounds to take the knee to amplify the message that racism has no place in football or society. \n Players took the knee on the opening weekend and in October for Matchweeks 10-11, which were dedicated to the  No Room For Racism  campaign. \n Kane targets festive records \n Christmas tends to be a wonderful time of the year for  Harry Kane  and this one could be his most memorable yet. \n If he scores against  Brentford , the  Tottenham Hotspur  forward will reach 10 goals, a new mark for strikes on Boxing Day. He could also surpass  Alan Shearer \u2019s leading total of 23 for the most goals over the whole festive period. Kane is just four goals away.\u00a0 \n On top of that, the Spurs striker is just five shy of his 200th Premier League goal. And with his team-mate  Son Heung-min  needing four more to reach 100, there could be milestones to celebrate in north London over the turn of the year. \n See: \u00a0 Kane targets festive goal records \n Can Haaland pick up where he left off? \n Erling Haaland  is well on course to win the  Castrol Golden Boot  in his debut Premier League season, returning to action with 18 goals to his name already. \n Worryingly for rival defences, the Norwegian has been resting during the World Cup and scored in his only friendly match during the tournament. Can anyone stop him from rewriting the records books? \n See:  Clinical Haaland has edge over chasing pack \n Can rested Salah find his form? \n Three-time Golden Boot winner  Mohamed Salah  is playing catch-up this season, scoring only six times so far. But, like Haaland, the Egyptian has had the benefit of a rest during the World Cup. \n With fresh legs and a more central role up front in a new  Liverpool  formation, it would be no surprise to see Salah returning to his blistering best and firing sixth-placed Liverpool up the table. \n FPL managers enter Second Chance league \n There is great news for  Fantasy Premier League  managers who missed the start of the 2022/23 season or are disappointed with their world ranking after 16 Gameweeks. \n A new Second Chance league has begun, where everyone starts from zero and scoring begins in Gameweek 17, with special prizes to be won at the season's end. \n Since managers have unlimited transfers until 11:00 GMT on Monday 26 December, there is every incentive for them to refocus and pick the best possible squad. \n See:   More on the Second Chance league \u00a0 \n More rest for players between matches \n The festive fixtures traditionally come thick and fast, but this season special arrangements have been made for players to allow more time between matches played across the three festive rounds. \n The rest period between Matchweeks 18-19 has been increased to ensure no club play within 48 hours of another of their matches. \n New managers aim to make an impact \n There were managerial changes shortly before the World Cup, and the new men in charge will be keen to instil their ideas as the league resumes. \n Julen Lopetegui faces an immediate six-pointer at the bottom of the table, with his  Wolverhampton Wanderers  side visiting 17th-placed  Everton  on Boxing Day. \n Nathan Jones  is set for his second fixture with  Southampton , while  Unai Emery  will look to pick up where he left off with  Aston Villa , having won his last two matches, although he faces Liverpool and Spurs in his next two. \n Gary O'Neil  must also navigate tough festive fixtures after taking permanent charge of  AFC Bournemouth  during the World Cup. The Cherries visit Chelsea on 27 December and  Manchester United  on 3 January. \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout's panel of experts discuss which players with favourable short-term schedules to target in  Fantasy Premier League  ahead of the FIFA World Cup break. \n What the experts say \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n Alex Iwobi  (\u00a35.5m) has turned his  Everton  career around and been their best player since the end of last season. The balance in midfield has allowed Iwobi to get forward more, and he's started turning this into returns, with one goal and five assists in his last eight matches. Owned by just 1.2 per cent of managers, he's a big differential and a great budget enabler with three good fixtures  at Fulham  and  AFC Bournemouth  either side of a  home match against Leicester City . \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n I've been really impressed by  Manchester United  in the last two Gameweeks.  Antony  (\u00a37.6m) is owned by only 9.9 per cent of managers and has scored three goals in his first six matches. With  West Ham United ,  Aston Villa  and  Fulham  up next, he has the fixtures to return some good points totals. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n What a job  Eddie Howe  is doing at  Newcastle United , and one of the key players he's getting the most out of is  Miguel Almiron  (\u00a35.4m). He now has five goals in his last five matches. Owned by just over 13 per cent, he remains a nice differential, although his popularity is increasing. \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n Ollie Watkins  (\u00a37.2m) is on my radar given  Aston Villa 's return to form. He had four big chances at the weekend, scoring his second goal of the season in the  4-0 win over Brentford . Watkins sits in only 1.9 per cent of squads. \n Nick\u00a0( @WGTA_Nick ) \n Man Utd players have floated under the radar, but they have some decent fixtures.  Diogo Dalot  (\u00a34.6m) has been a solid first-choice right-back all season and is an absolute bargain. In midfield,  Antony  and  Marcus Rashford  (\u00a36.6m) look like solid picks and  Bruno Fernandes  (\u00a39.8m) could be an ultimate differential at only 2.3 per cent ownership. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n James Maddison  (\u00a38.2m) is arguably in the form of his life, and with six goals already this season I'm backing him to add to that tally before the FIFA World Cup. Sold by the masses ahead of his suspension, he's now under 10 per cent-owned. \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n Granit Xhaka  (\u00a35.1m) is playing as a No 8 for  Arsenal  and has three goals and three assists. He is  at home to Nottingham Forest  in Gameweek 14.  Anthony Gordon  (\u00a35.4m) and  Jack Grealish  (\u00a36.8m) are also owned by under five per cent. Back from suspension, Gordon scored in Everton\u2019s  3-0 win over Crystal Palace at the weekend. \n As  Manchester City  have already qualified from their UEFA Champions League group, I have a sneaky feeling  Riyad Mahrez  (\u00a37.5m) will play their remaining European matches and Grealish will get more starts in the league. If he does, the England star could be a great differential pick as Man City could score 10+ goals over their next three matches  at Leicester City , and then  home to Fulham  and  Brentford . \n GW14 deadline: 11:00 BST, Sat 29 Oct \u00a0 \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 GW13 Lessons: 'Dead-end' with differentials \n",

The midfielder averages 8.7 points per match against  his opponents on Wednesday, West Ham United . He has only failed to return once in the last six Premier League matches against the Hammers. With Liverpool high on  confidence after  beating Manchester City  in Gameweek 11, I am backing the Egyptian. \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Harry Kane  (\u00a311.5m) has now scored goals in five consecutive matches for the first time in his career. The forward has returned in every Gameweek, with the exception of Gameweek 1. He has also returned in his last two visits to Manchester United. In those two matches he has returned 22 points. \n Pranil Sheth ( @Lateriser12 ) \n Salah  was terrific in a central role against Man City. He's my favourite option for captaincy this week. He is playing at home against a West Ham team who have defensive injuries. \n Andy Park ( @FPL_Sonaldo ) \n If I do decide to get to Salah, he is a very solid captain pick. But not all of us will have him, or we'll be unable to get to him. I think captaincy should be quite spread this week, so going for a gut captaincy call is also fine.  Kane ,  Leandro Trossard  (\u00a36.9m),  Aleksandar Mitrovic  (\u00a36.7m),  Dominic Solanke  (\u00a35.8m) and  Kieran Trippier  (\u00a35.7m) are all shouts. I'm leaning towards my guy  Son Heung-min  (\u00a311.8m) if I don't have Salah. \n Jamie Pigott ( @Futbolislifefpl ) \n The best captains in my opinion are  Salah ,  Trossard  and  Kane  in that order, depending on who you have in your squad. \n Paul Gee ( @FPLPaulGee ) \n Salah  is back. If you have him, captain him. He could do some serious damage against a depleted West Ham defence. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_Crabdogg ) \n Mitrovic\u00a0should be back to full fitness  at home to Aston Villa , who are struggling. I also like some Chelsea players.  Raheem Sterling  (\u00a39.9m) could take advantage of some counter-attacking opportunities  at Brentford . \n Pras ( @FPL_Pras ) \n For those that held or can easily get to Salah, he's the best pick at home to the Hammers. He could have had more than the solitary goal against Man City at the weekend, while he hit a hat-trick in the UEFA Champions League last week. For those who can't get to Salah, there are decent alternatives with  Kane   away at Man Utd ,  Trossard  at home to Nottingham Forest  and  Wilfried Zaha  (\u00a37.5m)  at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers . \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @Zophar666 ) \n West Ham have a lot of injuries at the back so Salah   could profit. Apart from that, Newcastle have been very strong at home so  Callum Wilson  (\u00a37.3m) or  Trippier  could also be good. \n Nick ( @WGTA_Nick ) \n Salah  is starting to hit form again across all competitions so he feels like the best pick. \n GW12 deadline: 18:00 BST, Tue 18 Oct \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 GW12 Ones to watch: Salah surges back into the spotlight Part 2: \u00a0 GW12 Differentials: Guehi provides value solution Part 3:\u00a0 Scout Selection: Best FPL team for Gameweek 12 Part 4:\u00a0 FPL experts: Trossard heads top Maddison replacements Part 5:\u00a0 The FPL Pod: Best options for the Man City and Arsenal blank Part 7:  GW12 Captains: Zaha can extend home run \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at the impact of the managerial changes so far this season and what to expect in the second half of the campaign. \n Roberto De Zerbi (BHA) \n Brighton & Hove Albion were left in excellent shape by outgoing head coach  Graham Potter , but this has not prevented  Roberto De Zerbi  from changing the side's identity. \n The Italian is renowned for producing bold and adventurous teams, and you can already see this is the direction he is taking with the Seagulls. \n His positive tactical approach against the division's strongest sides has instantly caught the eye. \n De Zerbi kicked off his tenure with a thrilling  3-3 draw at Liverpool , before  Brighton  then became one of few visiting teams to dominate possession against  Manchester City  at the Etihad Stadium, albeit in a  3-1 loss . \n The Seagulls then  thumped Potter's Chelsea 4-1  at home in a display that dazzled with attacking intent from the very first whistle. \n De Zerbi has wasted no time in stamping his mark. \n Brighton's stats comparison \n \n \n \n 2022/23 \n De Zerbi \n Potter \n \n \n \n \n Succ. passes/90 \n 468.4 \n 337.8 \n \n \n Long passes/90 \n 48.6 \n 62.6 \n \n \n Possession (%) \n 59.6 \n 49.9 \n \n \n Penalty area entries/90 \n 33.6 \n 28.8 \n \n \n Shots/90 \n 14.1 \n 13.6 \n \n \n \n One of the clearest tactical changes under De Zerbi has been his determination for Brighton to be press-resistant. \n Even when opponents try to win turnovers inside their defensive third, he wants his goalkeeper and defenders to hold their nerve by playing short through the thirds. \n It is a risky policy, but when the Seagulls do beat the press, as they did on numerous occasions against  Chelsea , they are likely to find more space to create problems at the other end of the pitch. \n Brighton are averaging 130 extra passes per match under De Zerbi, which translates to a 10 per cent rise in average possession. \n Landing on a 4-2-3-1 formation as his preferred shape, the 43-year-old does not want his defenders or midfielders to attempt too many long passes. \n Centre-backs  Lewis Dunk  and  Adam Webster  have significantly reduced the number of hopeful forward passes they pump towards the wings, or the striker. \n Since Potter left for Stamford Bridge, Brighton's long-pass output has fallen by 24 per cent. \n Risk v reward \n The Seagulls have pressed superbly for a couple of seasons, and De Zerbi wants to continue promoting that aspect of their play. \n He has demanded that his players be aggressive when they close down opponents, and they have responded by averaging 2.3 shots per match from high turnovers; up from 1.7 under the previous regime. \n No Premier League side has attempted more shots from high turnovers this season than Brighton. \n Brighton's high turnovers \n \n \n \n 2022/23 \n De Zerbi \n Potter \n \n \n \n \n Matches \n 8 \n 6 \n \n \n Shot-ending high turnovers \n 18 (2.3) \n 10 (1.7) \n \n \n High turnovers against \n 79 (9.9) \n 39 (6.5) \n \n \n \n On the flip side Brighton are now more likely to concede chances by relinquishing possession inside their own half. \n Brighton under De Zerbi are averaging 9.9 high turnovers against them per match, which is a steep rise from 6.5 under Potter. \n But in the long term, the Italian feels the rewards for sticking to his principles will outweigh the risks attached to playing cat and mouse with opposition forwards inside their own defensive third. \n Exciting future \n Brighton's tactical evolution under De Zerbi will be exciting to watch. \n His boldness may well make them less solid in the short term, but once Brighton's players become fully accustomed to his methods, this style of play has the potential to take the club on to the next level. \n Although they remain underdogs in the race for a top-six finish this season, under De Zerbi this exciting Brighton side could soon become regular challengers. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Positive approach paying off for O'Neil Part 3:  Southampton's pressing style the way forward Part 4:  How Lopetegui will restore Wolves' resilience \n",

Quite possibly. \n Isak likes to roam along the forward line and could revel in a free role, with Wilson pushed up on to the last defender. \n The alternative would be for Howe to rotate them in his starting XI. \n Wilson and Isak compared \n \n \n \n 2022/23 \n Wilson \n Isak \n \n \n \n \n Mins played \n 735 \n 244 \n \n \n Goals \n 6 \n 2 \n \n \n Mins per goal \n 122.5 \n 121.5 \n \n \n Shots/90 \n 3.31 \n 2.96 \n \n \n Big chances/90 \n 1.35 \n 1.48 \n \n \n Conv. rate % \n 26.09% \n 28.57% \n \n \n Touches in opp. box/90 \n 5.76 \n 5.56 \n \n \n Succ. passes/90 \n 8.2 \n 8.52 \n \n \n \n Wilson and Isak have delivered almost identical numbers for Newcastle this term. \n Howe may want them both to be more involved in his side\u2019s build-up play, but when it comes to chances and their ability to convert them, there is nothing to separate the duo. \n For now, the Newcastle head coach does not need to worry about that quandary. \n Wilson will lead the line on Sunday at St Mary\u2019s, and he is playing well enough to make the difference. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 In-form Pickford aims to continue best-ever start Part 2:  Aubameyang key to Potter's derby hopes Part 4:  Nunez pace and power can hurt Spurs \n",

This made Milner the youngest scorer in the competition's history at 16 years and 356 days until  James Vaughan  took his record in 2005. \n He said that having Liverpool's  Ben Doak , who celebrated his 17th birthday yesterday, alongside him on the bench against Southampton reminded him of his own long journey. \n \u201cSeeing people like Ben Doak come in, and how well he played the other day, it\u2019s pleasing to see that and that brings back a few memories as well,\" Milner said. \"I remember being his age doing that as well.\" \n Milner's first PL goal \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Since his debut 20 years ago, 3,292 players have gone on to make a Premier League appearance, while Milner has been a model of consistency. He has featured at least 22 times in each of the 19 subsequent seasons. \n That summer,  Rio Ferdinand  had just completed his controversial move from Leeds to  Manchester United , while  Manchester City  had bought  Nicolas Anelka  from Paris Saint-Germain.\u00a0 \n At the time of his debut, Westlife\u2019s \u201cUnbreakable\u201d was No 1 in the UK, while Eminem\u2019s \u201cLose Yourself\u201d had replaced \u201cDilemma\u201d (Nelly ft Kelly Rowland) at No 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. \n His career has spanned five top-flight clubs - Leeds,  Newcastle United ,  Aston Villa , Man City and  Liverpool  - scoring for all of them and winning the Premier League title three times, twice with City (2011/12 and 2013/14) and most recently with Liverpool in 2019/20. \n \n \n 3,292 players have competed in the  #PL  since  @JamesMilner 's debut back in 2002! \ud83d\ude2f From  @LUFC  to  @LFC , this is the story of his incredible career \ud83d\udcd6  pic.twitter.com/lnGpR5PBOu \n\u2014 Premier League (@premierleague)  November 12, 2022 \n \n 'Exceptional player and person' \n Jurgen Klopp  hailed Milner's impact on the Merseyside club. \"He is an exceptional player and an exceptional person,\" the Liverpool manager said. \"He is essential for everything we reached in the last few years.\"\u00a0 \n As for whether he will break Barry\u2019s record of 653 Premier League appearances, Milner expressed caution. \n \"[It''s] is a long way off,\" he said. \"You know me, game by game and I just want to keep working and contributing as much as I can to this football club.\u201d \n Record-breaker \n Milner's 55 goals have been scored across every team. Indeed when he has got on the scoresheet, the 36-year-old has proved a lucky charm. Milner has scored in 54 matches without ever being on the losing side, a competition record. \n An unassuming player respected for his resilience, determination and enthusiasm, he also broke Neymar\u2019s record for most assists in a single UEFA Champions League campaign, registering nine during Liverpool\u2019s charge to the final in 2017/18. \n On the domestic front, he boasts 87 Premier League assists and sits in ninth place between  Steven Gerrard  (92) and  Manchester United 's  David Beckham  (80). \n",

Patrick Vieira 's Palace  beat Arsenal 3-0  when they met at Selhurst Park in April, and have lost only once in their last eight encounters with the Gunners. \n Hammer time for Haaland \n Man City must negotiate a challenging trip to  West Ham United  that will be televised live on Sky Sports in the UK on Sunday at 16:30 BST. \n Opening-weekend matches in London hold mixed memories for  Pep Guardiola .  Tottenham Hotspur  handed Man City a  1-0 defeat \u00a0last season, while in 2019/20, Guardiola's team  crushed West Ham 5-0  at the London Stadium. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n In their most recent meeting, on 15 May, West Ham gave Man City a big shock, going 2-0 up at half-time before the champions recovered to  draw 2-2  and get their title bid back on track. Guardiola will be hoping the addition of the prolific striker Erling Haaland will bring a more positive start.\u00a0 \n Another Liverpool goal fest? \n It seems goals are guaranteed in the 12:30 BST kick-off on Saturday (live on BT Sport in the UK) as  Liverpool  have been drawn against  Fulham . \n Jurgen Klopp  will open a campaign against a promoted team for the fourth season running and their past three meetings against Watford,  Leeds United  and Norwich City respectively have averaged more than five goals. This might be music to the ears of new Liverpool forward Darwin Nunez, who scored 26 goals in 28 matches for Benfica last season.\u00a0 \n Newcastle test for Forest\u00a0 \n Nottingham Forest  will end their 23-year exile from the Premier League with a trip to  Newcastle United . Forest have one of the best opening-weekend records in Premier League history, but face a Magpies side who were resurgent under  Eddie Howe  in the second half of the season. \n AFC Bournemouth , the other promoted team, will host  Aston Villa  in what is a repeat of the Cherries'  first Premier League fixture . \n Everton 's home tie with  Chelsea , which kicks off at 17:30 BST on Saturday, will bring happy memories for Toffees manager  Frank Lampard . A  1-0 win in May at Goodison , against the club where he is a legend, helped Lampard to steer Everton out of the relegation zone. \n In the other live televised match in the UK,  Erik ten Hag  starts life as  Manchester United  manager at Old Trafford against  Brighton & Hove Albion  in the Sunday 14:00 BST fixture. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Boxing Day derbies galore \n The importance of the Boxing Day fixtures are even greater this season, as they will be the first after the 2022 FIFA World Cup final on Sunday 18 December 2022. \u00a0 \u00a0 Special arrangements have been made to allow more time between matches played across the three festive match rounds giving squads greater time to recover. Previously, clubs were given a minimum of 48 hours between matches.\u00a0 \u00a0 Boxing Day fixtures will be played on 26 and 27 December, with the following Matchweek played across 29-31 December. The New Year match round will be played on 2-5 January.\u00a0 \n This year's Boxing Day schedule will feature three London derbies as well as a south-coast meeting for  Southampton  and Brighton. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n More final-day thrills? \n After a thrilling 2021/22 season where so much was decided on the final round of fixtures, the eyes of fans, players and managers soon turn to their Matchweek 38 opponents, on 28 May, 2023. \n The two main title rivals for the past four seasons are both away from home.

        "text": "\n With player prices in Fantasy Premier League susceptible to price changes on a daily basis, here is an explanation of how and why this occurs. \n Why prices change \n Player prices may change when they are heavily transferred in or out by FPL managers. A player's price can rise by \u00a30.1m per day if they are a popular transfer in. However, if a player is heavily sold by FPL managers, their price can drop by \u00a30.1m per day. \n The change in a player's price will reflect their activity in the transfer market. \n When prices change \n Player price changes happen overnight UK time. \n Impact of price changes \n When a player has a price change, it can have an impact on FPL managers. \n Managers can find themselves priced out of buying a player that they want. This can be because one of their players has decreased by \u00a30.1m or the player that they have been targeting, has risen by \u00a30.1m. \n Over the course of the season, FPL managers try to grow their team value by investing in the players, who are the most popular transfers in. This means that their team would be worth more than the \u00a3100m given to FPL managers in pre-season. \n However, the transfer market can also mean that manager' team value can slip under \u00a3100m, if their players are heavily transferred out. \n Monitor transfers in and out \n Managers should monitor the  transfers in and out  of players over the course of the season. This will allow managers to see who the most popular transfers in are; the players likely to rise in price, as well as the most heavily-sold players, who are likely to fall in price. \n Prices shown on the transfer page are players' selling prices minus any sell-on fee. To check the price you paid for a player, please use the list view on the transfers page. \n The selling price for a player may be less than the current price at which FPL managers can buy the player. \n This is a sell-on fee of 50 per cent (rounded up to the nearest \u00a30.1m), will be applied on any profits made on that player. For example, if FPL managers buy a player for \u00a35.5m and sell him when his price is \u00a35.9m, the selling price will be \u00a35.7m. \n See:\u00a0 Fantasy Premier League stats \n",

\n Joelinton  scored with a towering header at Leicester on Boxing Day, which highlighted their fragility at dealing with aerial threats. \n Leicester have conceded four headed goals this term, and 40 shots from headers, the sixth-highest figure in the division in both categories. \n Lacking a tall goalkeeper, a commanding central defender, and full-backs who are aerially strong, opponents do try to prey on this potential weakness. \n Top aerial threat \n \n \n \n Headed shots \n Headed goals \n \n \n \n \n Fulham \n 47 \n Spurs \n 10 \n \n \n Liverpool \n 43 \n Fulham \n 9 \n \n \n Spurs \n 43 \n Liverpool \n 6 \n \n \n \n Liverpool are excellent in the air, so this aspect of the match will be a tactical concern. \n Jurgen Klopp 's side pose a serious danger from set-pieces, while in open play they also benefit from excellent service into the box provided by crosses from full-backs  Andrew Robertson  and  Trent Alexander-Arnold . \n Van Dijk's set-piece finish \n \n \n Calm as you like \ud83d\ude0e @VirgilvDijk  doubling our lead with a beautifully controlled finish \u26bd  pic.twitter.com/JVPIEIsEGE \n\u2014 Liverpool FC (@LFC)  December 26, 2022 \n \n Rodgers' side were on a terrific run prior to the FIFA World Cup 2022 break but their form against the division's strongest teams remains underwhelming. \n The Foxes have lost seven, drawn two and won no matches so far against clubs placed 12th or above. \n Room for improvement \n Conceding four, five and six away to  Arsenal ,  Brighton & Hove Albion  and  Tottenham Hotspur  respectively, there are question marks surrounding their resilience as a team, especially on the road. \n Leicester have scored in 14 consecutive away Premier League matches, so they will ask questions of Liverpool in this contest. \n But can they keep out the goals at the other end of the pitch? \n To stand any chance of picking up a positive result at Anfield, Leicester must defend far better than they did last time out and come up with a plan to protect some of their more obvious flaws. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  Can Lloris and Martinez bring World Cup form to clubs?

In football there\u2019s probably no greater acclaim than being recognised by your own club for your achievements, however big, however small. \n Lacey has been honoured as  Palace 's PL Community Captain for over two decades of service to the community he knows and loves. \n Starting his work with the  Palace For Life Foundation  in 1999, Lacey has overseen an evolution of the community local to south London. Susan Patterson-Smith works closely alongside him and is clear on the secrets to his local success. \n \"It's not just about football coaching,\" says Patterson-Smith. \"It's the role model he\u2019s been to those young people. Throughout the years the Foundation has changed, back then it was football in schools, a bit of mentoring here and there, but now there are so many areas that have grown.\" \n See:  Updates from the PL30 Trophy Tour \n Susan puts Lacey's success down to one unique trait. \n \"His consistency is the biggest part,\" she explains. \"Young people need someone who's going to be genuine, consistent and there full stop, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s been.\" \n Lacey grew up in a house with nine children, so working and squabbling together gave him the early groundings he needed to work in a turbulent community setting. \n But the rigours of working with a diverse set of children is no trouble for Lacey as many could see themselves represented within Lacey and vice versa. \n \n \n Introducing our  @PremierLeague  Community Captain: Michael Lacey 2\ufe0f\u20e33\ufe0f\u20e3 years at Palace for Life Coached at our first  #PLKicks  sessions 1\ufe0f\u20e3 fully deserved award Thank you for everything you have done, Michael! \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc99 #CPFC   #PalaceforLife   #PL30 \n\u2014 Palace for Life Fdn. (@PalaceForLife)  October 7, 2022 \n \n \"They see me as the go-to person,\" Lacey says. \"The kids I've worked with over the years, not just at Palace but the local children and a lot of the guys we had, it wasn't just about football it\u2019s about life. We take any time we can to get them off the streets and get them playing football.\" \n Football being a case of life and death, is a clich\u00e9 that many are guilty of using loosely, for Lacey it was a reality. At times in the past Lacey would go to Canary Road, known for heightened tensions around rival gangs, and a place where other coaches would avoid, where he created a footballing safe haven. \n \"No Palace staff have worked there apart from me, they wouldn't go down there because it was terrible, like a war-zone.\" \n Anyone who has been lucky enough to be within walking distance of Selhurst Park will know of the strong connection to family that exists at the club. It's something that Lacey reflects on in his own work.\u00a0 \n Zaha's helping hand \n \"If you're passionate about young people, they become your family,\" says Lacey. \n With prot\u00e9g\u00e9s nationwide that Lacey remains in close contact with, his words aren't to be taken lightly. \n Wilfried Zaha 's electric style and guile on the ball was something that comes as no surprise to Lacey who helped nurture the talent whose style hasn't changed to this day. Lacey's  Premier League Kicks  sessions gave Zaha a different relaxed environment that was crucial at a young age. \n Joe Shields, currently co-director of recruitment and talent at  Chelsea , found his beginnings in the game learning from Lacey from the PL Kicks programme and is now a close friend. \n Shields played for Lacey at PL Kicks, before going on to be a coach alongside his favourite teenage mentor. His journey to one of the leading positions at a Premier League club also involved him scout for Palace before recruiting for  Manchester City 's academy. \n It all began with some key words of advice from Lacey, \"I said 'go express yourself, don't be scared, do what you do. I've got your back.'\" \n Words so simple yet so profound that they helped a shy boy, become the man he is today. \n The reach of Lacey's alumni stretches across various fields but they continue to work impacting the lives of young people. At least two of Lacey's mentees now work locally in education as a deputy headteacher and head of Year 3. \n Five years on from being  named as a PL Kicks Hero , Lacey is now Palace's Community Captain, what's next for the man who's impacted the lives of hundreds of children in south London? Well, having moved from football coach to coaching the lives of young people, Lacey hopes to mentor another generation of young people. \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke profiles four players who are coming back from injury and will be like a new signing when the Premier League returns. \n Wesley Fofana (CHE) \n Fofana\u2019s upcoming return from a knee injury suffered in October is a very welcome boost for  Chelsea  head coach  Graham Potter . \n \n \n \n \n \n CHE \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 0 \n \n BOU \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Chelsea lost their last three Premier League matches before the FIFA World Cup 2022, a run that included a  4-1 defeat  at Potter\u2019s former club  Brighton & Hove Albion . \n Defensively, they have struggled. From open play, Chelsea have an Expected Goals Against (xGA) score of 14.46, which ranks 13th among all teams this season. \n Summer signing Fofana, 22, will reinforce them at the back. \n He was named in two of Potter's first three starting XIs, playing his part in victories versus  Crystal Palace  and AC Milan, scoring his maiden Chelsea goal against the Italian side. \n However, the former  Leicester City  star was forced off with a knee problem in the 38th minute of that UEFA Champions League match. \n Versatile defender \n Since a superb 2020/21 campaign, Fofana has endured a frustrating spell. \n Last term he was limited to only seven top-flight starts, after fracturing his fibula in a pre-season friendly for Leicester. \n It was his previous form that earned him a move to Stamford Bridge, though, and if he can replicate those consistent performances, he will become a firm favourite in west London. \n When fully fit, Fofana would likely be regarded as first-choice ahead of  Trevoh Chalobah  and  Cesar Azpilicueta  on the right of a back three. \n The Frenchman is also a reliable option to play on the right of a central defensive pairing, just as he did at Selhurst Park in Potter\u2019s first Premier League match at the helm. \n On the front foot \n Fofana is outstanding at the art of making interceptions. \n Positionally sound, but also proactive in his approach, he is adept at stepping forward to regain possession from a stray pass. \n This season, he is averaging 3.5 interceptions per match in the Premier League, making nine interceptions in two outings for the Foxes prior to his transfer. \n Fofana interceptions 2022/23 \n \n \n \n Opponent \n Interceptions \n \n \n \n \n Brentford \n 5 \n \n \n Arsenal \n 4 \n \n \n West Ham \n 1 \n \n \n Crystal Palace \n 4 \n \n \n \n Breaking up play with eye-catching interceptions is undoubtedly one of Fofana\u2019s great strengths. \n During his imperious 2020/21 campaign, his first in English football, he made the joint-fourth most interceptions by defenders. \n The Blues will benefit greatly from this aspect of his game. \n Most interceptions in 2020/21 \n \n \n \n Defender \n Interceptions \n \n \n \n \n Jan Bednarek (SOU) \n 84 \n \n \n Ben White (BHA) \n 62 \n \n \n Aaron Wan-Bissaka (MUN) \n 62 \n \n \n Wesley Fofana (LEI) \n 61 \n \n \n Liam Cooper (LEE) \n 61 \n \n \n \n Fofana is due to return to fitness around the same time as another key Chelsea player,  Reece James . \n The availability of these two excellent young defenders will have a positive impact on the team. \n Both bring pace, strength, ball-carrying excellence and high levels of technical ability on the ball. \n Chelsea will be thrilled to have both players back as they target a return to winning ways. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Smith Rowe return will sharpen Arsenal's cutting edge Part 2:  How Isak can fire Newcastle's top-four challenge Part 3:  Martial ready to be United's leading man after Ronaldo exit \n",

The League is broadcast to 800million homes in 188 countries. Crowds attending matches last season were at an all-time high, with a total attendance over the 380 matches of 15.2million. \n Significant financial support \n This growing popularity has enabled the League to provide a significant level of financial support throughout the game and to communities across England and Wales, which is unparalleled in professional sport. \n Over the next three years, the League will continue its world-leading levels of support by contributing \u00a31.6billion to communities and the wider game. \n Premier League Chief Executive Richard Masters said: \u201cAs we look back on the last 30 years, people will have their own favourite Premier League memories. \n \n \n \"We are proud of the unprecedented funding we provide for communities and wider football\" \n \n Premier League CEO Richard Masters \n \n \n \n \"For many this will be the moments of brilliance players have produced on the pitch \u2013 the unforgettable goals, skills, matches and seasons.

In Head-to-Head league matches in Fantasy, if neither manager made transfers incurring points deductions that Gameweek, then the matches will be drawn and managers will earn one point each. \n What about FPL Draft? As there are no points deductions for transfers, all matches in Classic and Head-to-Head leagues will be drawn. \n What about transfers, Wildcards and chips? Please note that managers can cancel any Triple Captain or Bench Boost chip they have played ahead of the Gameweek 7 deadline. This deadline  11:00 BST Saturday 10 September . \n Managers who have played their Free Hit chips won't be able to cancel them but they will be automatically reinstated after the Gameweek 7 deadline. \n Any Triple Captain and Bench Boost chips played in Gameweek 7 will also be reinstated after the deadline. \n Wildcards will roll over into the next Gameweek. \n What happens to the postponed fixtures?\u00a0 The postponed fixtures will be allocated to another date or dates. Points scored in these fixtures will apply to the Gameweek in which the fixtures are played and not to Gameweek 7. \n What happens next? The Premier League will provide further updates during the period of mourning when appropriate. \n These are exceptional circumstances, and we appreciate the understanding of FPL managers while the situation evolves. \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout's panel of  Fantasy Premier League  experts share their thoughts on potential players to transfer in for Gameweek 21 ahead of  Saturday's 11:00 GMT deadline . \n What the experts say \n Lee Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n Have  Southampton  turned a bit of a corner under Nathan Jones? If they're to continue improving, then moving  James Ward-Prowse  (\u00a36.2m) into a more advanced No 10 role is surely something that the manager will keep doing. Plus, we know how deadly he can be from set-pieces.\u00a0 \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @Zophar666 ) \n No team has scored more goals since the restart than  Brighton & Hove Albion  and  Kaoru Mitoma  (\u00a35.0m) is a great differential pick owned by under two per cent of the game. He's only \u00a35.0m and a great replacement for either  Miguel Almiron  (\u00a35.9m) or  Andreas Pereira  (\u00a34.6m). \n Sam Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n Che Adams  (\u00a36.3m) has a goal and three assists in five matches under head coach Jones. He is averaging 5.2 points-per-match since Gameweek 16, up from 3.2 points in the opening 15 Gameweeks.  \n His eight shots in the box since Gameweek 16 is team-leading, while Adams has had three big chances, the same as  Ward-Prowse . Opponents  Aston Villa  have conceded 14 big chances in the last four Gameweeks, the second most in the league. I expect Adams to get some good opportunities this weekend. \n Ben Crabtree\u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n Brighton are looking great, so they're the perfect place to look for differentials. I'm backing the exciting \u00a0Mitoma  to continue to pick up returns. \n Nick Harris ( @WGTA_Nick )\u00a0 \n The best differential for me this weekend would be  Dejan Kulusevski  (\u00a37.9m). Spurs have been patchy of late but when he plays they look a lot better. He may be the catalyst to a return to form. His goal against Man City on Thursday could be a sign of things to come for Kulusevski and Spurs.\u00a0 \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n Wilfried Gnonto  (\u00a35.0m) was starting to catch the eye in a  Leeds United  shirt before the FIFA World Cup 2022 with some good cameos. However, now he's a starter for Jesse Marsch, and he's high on my watchlist.  \n Gnonto offers really good goal threat in a team I always back to score. At 0.4 per cent owned and only \u00a35.0m, I'm keen to make him my third forward if this form continues. \n Pras ( @Pras_FPL ) \n Most differentials come for Brighton given how attacking they have been. Both \u00a0Mitoma  and  Solly March  (\u00a35.1m) feel like great differential picks. But they won't be differentials for long! \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 GW21 Scout Selection Part 2:\u00a0 GW21 Captains \n",

Along with  Chelsea , they are one of only two sides who have a Double Gameweek 19.\u00a0 \n Make changes to your FPL squad now \n Darwin Nunez (LIV) \u00a39.0m \n Liverpool 's summer signing was in prolific form prior to the season break. \n Darwin produced five goals and an assist in his final seven outings across all competitions, blanking just twice in that run. \n Uruguay's early elimination from the FIFA World Cup 2022 lessens the likelihood of rotation, suggesting he will retain his role as the Reds' striker when domestic action returns. \n Harry Kane (TOT) \u00a311.6m \n The  Tottenham Hotspur  forward is the second top-scoring player in Fantasy, amassing 102 points in 15 appearances. \n Kane has blanked on just three of those occasions, combining 12 goals with three assists and 21 bonus points. \n Bringing in a budget enabler such as  Miguel Almiron  (\u00a35.8m) or  Rodrigo  (\u00a36.3m) in midfield could help free up funds to bring Kane in alongside  Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.2m) in managers' forward lines.\u00a0 \n Eddie Nketiah (ARS) \u00a36.5m \n Jesus' absence gives the 23-year-old the chance to offer major value as a cut-price route into the Arsenal attack. \n An ownership of only 0.3 per cent also highlights Nketiah's potential as a huge differential for Gameweek 17. \n The Gunners' short-term schedule adds to his appeal, with back-to-back encounters  with West Ham United  and  Brighton & Hove Albion  up next. \n Che Adams (SOU) \u00a36.4m \n Southampton 's kind run of upcoming opponents looks encouraging for his prospects under new first-team manager Nathan Jones. \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), five of their next seven matches score only two. \n Adams scored and earned eight points in Jones' first match at the helm  in a 3-1 defeat at Liverpool  in Gameweek 16. \n Furthermore, his totals of 29 shots, 24 shots in the box, 10 big chances and 12 shots on target are all more than any team-mate. \n",

It then combines this data with each team's home and away form over the past six fixtures.\u00a0 \n This creates a value that offers a perceived difficulty for each team when facing them home and away. \n These values are then simplified into ratings from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest difficulty value. \n Red alert \n If you view information for any player, either in your squad or in the player list, and check out their fixtures, you will see the FDR represented. \n Colour coding is used to help portray the FDR value, with green depicting a low-difficulty fixture and red the highest. \n The ratings are reviewed after each Gameweek, although major changes will not be applied immediately until home and away form for each team is more established. \n Even so, the FDR provides guidance on players who enjoy runs of fixtures that could promote their FPL points hauls. \n Ahead of each Gameweek, articles will use the FDR to identify teams with such runs, to help guide your short and mid-term transfer decisions. \n",

Off the ball he focuses on regains and protecting the centre-backs behind him. \n He produced an outstanding individual performance in the  1-1 draw at Chelsea , highlighting his role in the team. \n Interestingly, Casemiro\u2019s only touch inside the  Chelsea  box was his brilliant headed equaliser, one of just three touches in the opposition area he has made in 619 minutes of action. \n \n \n \ud83d\udca5  @Casemiro 's first United goal couldn't have come at a better time! \u2764\ufe0f #MUFC  ||  #CHEMUN \n\u2014 Manchester United (@ManUtd)  October 22, 2022 \n \n Casemiro was also in fantastic form during United\u2019s  2-0 win at home to Tottenham Hotspur . \n That night he won four tackles, made two interceptions, and also claimed 10 ball recoveries for Ten Hag\u2019s side. \n When the time is right, Casemiro will leave his station to recover possession for his team. \n Smart acquisition \n Keeping the ball well, he also feeds a lot of sharp forward passes into team-mates ahead of him. \n In his primary role as a ball winner, the Brazilian has also excelled. \n Just six starts into his Premier League career, Casemiro leads the United rankings for most of the key defensive metrics. \n Casemiro's defensive ranking* \n \n \n \n Stat \n Per 90 \n MUN rank \n \n \n \n \n Ball recoveries \n 7.71 \n 1st \n \n \n Possession won \n 4.22 \n 1st \n \n \n Interceptions \n 1.60 \n 1st \n \n \n Tackles won \n 1.89 \n 1st \n \n \n \n *Min five starts \n Casemiro experienced his first below-par performance in the  3-1 defeat at Aston Villa  last weekend. \n United\u2019s shape was pulled around too easily that day and, as a collective, they struggled to cope with Villa\u2019s aggressive counter-pressing. \n On Sunday they face  Fulham , who have been fantastic in central midfield this season, thanks in part to a strong partnership between  Harrison Reed  and  Joao Palhinha . \n Reed is suspended for this match, and his absence might just hand United the initiative they seek inside the middle third. \n With the world-class Casemiro in the starting XI, do not be surprised if United dominate that midfield battle at Craven Cottage. \n Also in this series \n See:  How Villa have embraced Emery's style of play \n",

Overall, he won 59 caps and scored 16 times for his country. \n Glittering success \n During his eight seasons with Sampdoria, Vialli\u2019s goals helped deliver the club\u2019s only Serie A title in 1990/91, while he also won the UEFA Cup Winners\u2019 Cup. \n \n \n \ud83d\udc94 Ciao Luca.  pic.twitter.com/8KAo9BsYaC \n\u2014 U.C. Sampdoria (@sampdoria)  January 6, 2023 \n \n A world-record transfer to Juventus in 1992 earned him even greater European glory, as he won the 1992/93 UEFA Cup and 1995/96 UEFA Champions League, in addition to domestic trophies. \n \n \n Ciao Gianluca  pic.twitter.com/C9P8oVLSnR \n\u2014 JuventusFC (@juventusfcen)  January 6, 2023 \n \n Having spent his entire life and career in his homeland, Vialli moved abroad to join Chelsea in 1996, leading an Italian movement as  Roberto Di Matteo  and  Gianfranco Zola  joined him later that year. \n Vialli won the FA Cup in his first season at Stamford Bridge and then became player-manager during the 1997/98 season. \n Chelsea manager \n He immediately led the Blues to glory in both the League Cup and UEFA Cup Winners\u2019 Cup, becoming the youngest manager to win a UEFA competition - a record that stood for 13 years. He went on to oversee victory in the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid. \n In 1998/99, Vialli secured a third-placed finish - the club\u2019s best performance for 29 years - and in 1999/2000 he won his second FA Cup, before masterminding a triumph over  Manchester United  in the Charity Shield. \n \n \n \n You\u2019ll be missed by so many. A legend to us and to all of football. Rest in peace, Gianluca Vialli. \ud83d\udc99  pic.twitter.com/mNJPDkCSYO \n\u2014 Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC)  January 6, 2023 \n \n \n Vialli departed in 2000 and had a spell in charge of Watford, after making an indelible mark at Stamford Bridge. Many Chelsea fans feel his arrival and tenure laid the foundations for the success that has followed ever since. \n The connection was mutual, with Vialli continuing to live in southwest London.\u00a0 \n \"I\u2019ve been quite lucky during my career because I\u2019ve played for only four clubs and every time I\u2019ve managed to fall in love,\" he said, when reflecting upon his career. \"With Chelsea fans, I had a fantastic relationship. We fell in love with each other. They never stopped encouraging me and when I became the manager the love and the passion went on.\" \n It was perhaps fitting that his final European triumph came just a few miles away, with Vialli working as chief of delegation for the Italy squad who won the 2020 European Championship at Wembley Stadium. \n",

His 865 successful passes rank first for Arsenal and third among all defenders this season. \n That has helped Saliba earn bonus points on five of the seven occasions he has kept a clean sheet. \n Bonus king Dalot\u00a0 \n Manchester United \u2019s Diogo Dalot   (\u00a34.8m) is another major beneficiary of the BPS thanks to his all-round displays. \n The Portuguese has been awarded the maximum three bonus points in four of the five matches he has kept a clean sheet. \n Indeed, despite producing just one assist in the first 16 Gameweeks, Dalot has picked up 12 bonus points, second only to Trippier in defence. \n Man Utd have a very favourable schedule once domestic action resumes, lifting the appeal of investing in Dalot during the unlimited free transfers period. \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), seven of their next nine matches score only two. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Start Ward and free up funds Part 3:\u00a0 Target goalscoring centre-backs Part 4:  Forward role helping Rodrigo thrive Part 5:\u00a0 Foden leads midfielders who thrive at home Part 6:  FPL unlimited transfers: Build around Salah and Haaland Part 7:  Kane a strong partner for Haaland Part 8:\u00a0 Solanke revived under new head coach \n",

6.2 per cent ahead of the next-closest stopper,  Brad Friedel . \n Well-protected by a great defensive spine though, Chelsea faced the joint-fewest shots on target (83) since records began in 2003/04. \n Fewest shots on target conceded \n \n \n \n Team \n Season \n Shots on target faced \n \n \n \n \n Chelsea \n 2004/05 \n 83 \n \n \n Man City \n 2018/19 \n 83 \n \n \n Liverpool \n 2007/08 \n 87 \n \n \n Man City \n 2017/18, 2021/22 \n 88 \n \n \n \n Mourinho built his tactical approach around a formidable defensive core, but he also worked hard to ensure his 4-3-3 was one of the most robust ever seen in English football. \n Rarely opened up, the Blues often deliberately soaked up pressure before hurting opponents on the counter. \n On those transitions and breakaways, flying wingers  Damien Duff  and newcomer  Arjen Robben  were quick, direct, and lethal. \n Robben scored seven goals and made nine assists in only 14 starts, while Duff chipped in with six goals and seven assists. \n Joe Cole  also enjoyed game time in those wider roles, scoring eight league goals too. \n Lampard's key role \n Playing in a slightly more advanced box-to-box role,  Frank Lampard  was well-suited to Mourinho\u2019s new 4-3-3. \n Given more freedom to play his natural attacking game than he had been in a pair, Lampard netted 13 goals and was the division\u2019s top assist provider with 18. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Forward rotation \n New signing  Didier Drogba  and Icelandic international  Eidur Gudjohnsen  also played their part in this unforgettable season. \n Their mobility and link play knitted the side together and they each chipped in with plenty of goals and assists too. \n Robben\u2019s 1.14 goals or assists per 90 minutes ranked him second in the Premier League, behind legendary  Arsenal  forward  Thierry Henry . \n Chelsea's top goals/assists 2004/05 \n \n \n \n Player \n Goals/Assists per 90 \n PL rank \n \n \n \n \n Robben \n 1.14 \n 2nd \n \n \n Drogba \n 0.83 \n 6th \n \n \n Lampard \n 0.82 \n 7th \n \n \n Gudjohnsen \n 0.65 \n 11th \n \n \n \n This brilliant Chelsea side were ruthless and efficient. \n Between December 2004 and February 2005, they kept 10 successive clean sheets, a sign of the discipline Mourinho had instilled in his players. \n Once in the lead, it was usually game over. \n This Chelsea team dropped points from 1-0 up just once all season, when  Bolton Wanderers fought back to earn a 2-2 draw  at Stamford Bridge. \n Tactically astute and exceptionally well-drilled, Chelsea were beaten only once in the entire campaign. \n Considering he had inherited a team that had lost seven matches the previous season, Mourinho's impact was staggering. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  PL30: The Special One Part 3:  Test your knowledge of Mourinho's Premier League career Part 4:  PL30: Jose Mourinho's first 10 Chelsea signings \n",

        "text": "\n A wait of 26 years for a top-flight English league title was ended for  Manchester United  as they became the inaugural Premier League champions in 1992/93. \n That first title success for  Sir Alex Ferguson  opened the floodgates for an unprecedented period of success for the Red Devils that stretched over three decades. \n Now 30 years on from that history-making season, we take a look at what the members of that famous squad have been up to since. \n Peter Schmeichel Apps: 42 \n Schmeichel ended his United career in 1998/99, winning a Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League treble in his final season. After two years at Sporting Lisbon, the Denmark goalkeeper returned to England with  Aston Villa  before finishing his career at  Manchester City . \n Since his retirement in April 2003, Schmeichel has\u00a0mostly worked as a television pundit and also appeared as a contestant on the 2006 edition of Strictly Come Dancing. He is a Global Ambassador for Man Utd. \n Denis Irwin Apps: 40 Goals: 5 \n Irwin\u2019s consistency and dependability for Man Utd is legendary - in each season at the club bar two between 1990 and 2000, he played over 40 matches. \n He joined\u00a0boyhood club  Wolverhampton Wanderers  after 328 Premier League appearances for United, in which he recorded 123 clean sheets and scored 18 goals. He helped Wolves achieve promotion to the top flight before hanging up his boots in 2004. \n Since then, the 54-year-old has appeared as a pundit for MUTV and works as an ambassador for United. He is also a columnist with Ireland's\u00a0Sunday World\u00a0newspaper. \n Paul Parker App: 31 Goals: 1 \n After leaving Old Trafford in the summer of 1995, the two-time Premier League winner had spells at  Fulham  and  Chelsea . He \u00a0 retired in 1997 after dropping into non-league with Farnborough Town. \n Parker earned his coaching badges and managed both Chelmsford City and Welling United, before moving to Singapore as technical director of JSSL Arsenal before returning to the UK. He is now a regular media pundit and most recently completed the London to Amsterdam bike ride raising funds for Prostate Cancer UK. \n Steve Bruce App: 42 Goals: 5 \n The centre-back left Old Trafford in 1996 and continued playing at Birmingham City and then Sheffield United, retiring at the end of the 1998/99 season after a career spanning 737 appearances and 81 goals. \n Bruce\u00a0is currently in charge of Championship club West Bromwich Albion, having held 11 other managerial positions in the last two decades, most recently in the Premier League at  Newcastle United . \n Gary Pallister Apps: 42 Goals: 1 \n Pallister\u00a0returned to\u00a0former club Middlesbrough in 1998 as a four-time Premier League winner. After three years at the Riverside, he retired in July 2001 aged 36 years following a string of persistent injuries. \n The 58-year-old briefly served as operations director at Darlington and now works in the media for both BBC and ITV Sport. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Clayton Blackmore Apps: 14 \n Blackmore played in United's first match of 1992/93, one of 14 appearances in an injury-hit spell at Old Trafford. The defender joined\u00a0Middlesbrough in 1994 and then had brief spells at Barnsley and Notts County before seeing out his playing career in non-league football. \n He returned to Man Utd as an academy coach (2010 - 2017), then joined the\u00a0coaching\u00a0staff at the Dynamo Brest Academy in Belarus. He is now a professional golfer and in June 2022 just fell short qualifying for the Senior Open at Gleneagles. \n Paul Ince Apps: 41 Goals: 6 \n An integral part of Ferguson\u2019s first great United side, Ince moved to\u00a0Inter Milan in 1995 before returning to the Premier League with  Liverpool  in 1997. He\u00a0had further spells at Middlesbrough,\u00a0Wolves, Swindon Town and Macclesfield Town before\u00a0retiring in 2001. \n Ince's first taste in management came as player/manager at Swindon, with further managerial roles at Macclesfield, MK Dons (twice), Blackburn Rovers, Notts County, Blackpool and now Reading. \n Bryan Robson Apps: 14 Goals: 1 \n When Robson's career at Old Trafford came to an end in 1994 he went straight into a role as player/manager at Middlesbrough as well as assisting England boss Terry Venables as coach and right-hand man. \n Robson left Boro after seven seasons in June 2001 and later rejoined his first club, West Brom, steering them to Premier League safety in 2004/05, before spells at Sheff Utd and as the national boss of Thailand. These days he's an ambassador for Man Utd and a TV pundit. \u00a0 \n Mike Phelan Apps: 11 \n Phelan left Old Trafford in 1994 but after 18 months at West Brom he was forced to quit through injury. \n The one-time Premier League winner gained managerial experience as assistant at clubs including Norwich City, Stockport County and Blackpool. He returned to Man Utd as reserve manager in 2001 and then worked under Sir Alex Ferguson as assistant manager between 2008 and 2013, but left that summer. \n Phelan returned for a third stint at the club in 2019 as  Ole Gunnar Solskjaer 's No.2 following a spell as the sporting director of Central Coast Mariners in Australia. \n Andrei Kanchelskis Apps: 27 Goals: 3 \n After an 18-year playing career in which he played across the globe from Scotland to Saudi Arabia, Kanchelskis retired in 2007, but within two years had taken on his first managerial role with FC\u00a0Torpedo-ZIL Moscow. \n He continued his globe-trotting in management with stints in Russia at both FC Ufa and Solyaris Moscow, Latvian side FC Jurmala most recently Navbahor Namangan in Uzbek. \n Ryan Giggs Apps: 41 Goals: 9 \n When Giggs announced his retirement in May 2014 it brought an end to a 24-year playing career in which he made 963 first-team appearances and amassed an incredible 35 winners\u2019 medals, including 13 Premier League titles and two UEFA Champions League trophies. \n He also won the FA Cup on four occasions, the League Cup three times as well as the UEFA Super Cup, Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. He had a brief stint as caretaker manager in 2014 following the dismissal of  David Moyes , and had a further two seasons as assistant to Louis Van Gaal before ending his 29-year association with the club in 2016. \n Lee Sharpe Apps: 27 Goals: 1 \n After a career plagued with injuries Sharpe retired from football aged just 32 following three seasons in the lower leagues with Bradford and Exeter City. \n The former winger appeared on a string of reality TV shows including Celebrity Love Island, Dancing on Ice and Celebrity Wrestling, before moving back into football as a pundit. He is now a professional golfer and after dinner speaker. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Eric Cantona Apps: 22 Goals: 9 \n After five successful years at Man Utd in which he won four Premier League titles, Cantona started a new career in beach football where he captained and also managed the French international side until 2011, winning the FIFA Beach Soccer Tournament in Brazil in 2005. \n He returned to 11-a-side football later that year as director of football at New York Cosmos, where he spent 18 months. \n Cantona has pursued a career in the film industry and has acted in a number of international films. \n Mark Hughes Apps: 41 Goals: 15 \n Hughes scored United\u2019s first goal in the Premier League era in the 2-1 opening day defeat at Sheff Utd and it was his 100th league goal against  Crystal Palace  that helped clinch their first ever Premiership crown. \n The striker\u00a0left Old Trafford for Chelsea in 1995, before spells at  Southampton ,  Everton  and Blackburn, retiring in 2002. \n Now manager at Bradford City, Hughes has also had spells as Wales national team boss, and managed at six clubs including Blackburn, Man City and Fulham. \n Brian McClair Apps: 42 Goals: 9 \n McClair retired from playing in 1998 after spending his final season with Motherwell. He cut his coaching teeth with the Scottish club and then Blackburn before returning to Old Trafford in 2001 as part of in the backroom staff, winning the Premier Reserve League and 2003 FA Youth Cup. \n After nine years as director of the Man Utd youth academy (2006-2015), McClair had a 12-month stint as performance director at the Scottish Football Association. McClair now hosts his own podcast, Life with Brian. \n Dion Dublin Apps: 7 Goals: 1 \n Dublin\u00a0enjoyed successful spells with Coventry City and Aston Villa after leaving United. He now works as a football commentator and pundit, and presents\u00a0Homes Under the Hammer on\u00a0BBC One. \n The former forward is also an amateur musician and invented a percussion instrument in 2006 called \u201cThe Dube\", which has been used and endorsed by the likes of Courtney Pine and Thomas Lang. \n Sir Alex Ferguson \n A regular face in the director's box at Old Trafford since his retirement in May 2013, Ferguson left behind a legacy that can arguably never be surpassed. \u00a0 \n Ferguson was in charge at Old Trafford for almost 27 years during which he claimed a record 13 Premier League titles. He also oversaw a then record number of 28 wins in a PL season in 1999/00, 2006/07 and 2008/09. He won Manager of The Year 10 times, and Manager of the Month on 27 occasions. \n There is now a Sir Alex Ferguson stand at Old Trafford and a statue outside the ground. Ferguson, 80, is also Vice-President of the National Football Museum. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  PL30: Fergie Time - fact or fiction?

        "summary": "The Scout's panel look at who is worth adding before the season pauses for the FIFA World Cup 2022",
        "text": "\n As the last Gameweek approaches before the season pauses for the FIFA World Cup 2022, The Scout's  panel of experts  discuss which players are worth adding to your  Fantasy Premier League  squad before  Saturday's 11:00 GMT deadline . \n See:\u00a0 FPL and FIFA World Cup: All you need to know about free transfers \n What the experts say \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Dejan Kulusevski  (\u00a38.0m) returned from injury in Gameweek 15 and assisted  Harry Kane  (\u00a311.6m) within two minutes of entering the field of play against  Liverpool  in Gameweek 15.  \n This was his fifth attacking return of the season in just eight appearances. Kulusevski was instrumental in  Tottenham Hotspur 's 4-0 victory over  Leeds  last season, scoring a goal, and he had more shots in the box in that fixture than any other player. Kulusevski is a huge differential owned by just 4.0 per cent of managers. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n Leon Bailey  (\u00a34.5m) has three returns in his last three matches and has got off to a good start under new manager Unai Emery. Despite the tough fixture against  Brighton & Hove Albion , I feel this could be a game well suited to him. Bailey is owned by just 4.4 per cent of managers.\u00a0 \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Given the yellow flags currently on  Aleksandar Mitrovic  (\u00a36.8m) and  Callum Wilson  (\u00a37.5m), FPL managers may be in the market for a budget striker. Look no further than  AFC Bournemouth 's 5.5 per cent-owned  Dominic Solanke  (\u00a35.8m). Up against an  Everton  defence who just conceded two goals at home to  Leicester City . \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n Andrew Robertson  (\u00a36.7m) is certainly on my radar as we see Liverpool's form improve and  Southampton  next seems a good opportunity for a clean sheet. Robertson is owned by just 4.1 per cent of the game. \n Nick ( @WGTA_Nick ) \n Darwin Nunez  (\u00a38.9m) hasn't quite lived up to his price tag to date. But the Liverpool forward could finally shine in a plum home match against Southampton. He is still a differential owned by just 8.7 per cent of managers.\u00a0 \n Andy Park ( @FPL_Sonaldo ) \n Whilst not a true differential because of his ownership  Ivan\u00a0 Perisic  (\u00a35.5m) springs to mind as a punt because of the Spurs wingback rotation.  \n They looked good in the second half against Liverpool and Perisic was basically highest up the pitch for Spurs; playing alongside Kane as a second striker.  With a home game against Leeds and a bounce-back win for Spurs a priority, a Perisic punt sounds exciting and sensible. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n Last week he was one of the most transferred-out players meaning that his ownership has decreased substantially. So even though he is over 20 per cent-owned  Wilfried\u00a0Zaha  (\u00a37.5m) should be a good punt for this week.  \n He played central last time out and rewarded his owners with a goal and an assist. When he's the most advanced  Crystal Palace  attacker, he's often a very good FPL asset and the fixture against  Nottingham Forest  looks a good one on paper. \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n I would start with some players from Man City,  Riyad Mahrez  (\u00a37.5m) or  Bernardo Silva  (\u00a36.9m) are good options if they start.  \n Liverpool, again some good picks there if budget allows,  Darwin  and  Andy Robertson  are good punts for the last Gameweek before the season pauses. At Spurs both  Perisic  and  Kulusevski  are good one-week picks too.\u00a0 \n Jamie Pigott ( @Futbolislifefpl ) \n My favorite punt for Gameweek 16 is  Darwin  if you can find space and budget for him.  \n Another one I would love to have if I could is  Kulusevski . He means so much to Spurs, which he proved at the weekend with his assist shortly after coming on as a substitute. He may not be rushed back in to the starting XI though, so keep an eye on Antonio Conte's press conference first. \n",

        "text": "\n In 2020, former Portsmouth winger Courtney Pitt was one of the first intake of six coaches on the Premier League, EFL and PFA Charity's  Professional Player to Coach Scheme \u00a0(PPCS) which aims to increase the number of black, and Asian and mixed heritage players moving into full-time coaching roles.\u00a0 \n Two years later, we caught up with him as he starts his new permanent role as the club's Head of Academy Coaching. \n What does the job entail? \n \"When I started out on my PPCS placement, I was gaining experience in six different departments including Foundation, Youth Development, and the Under-18s in order to get a well-rounded behind-the-scenes view of how the Academy works. I then oversaw the U9s, U11s and continued to move through the age groups to gain further experience. \n \"The club saw my progress and how hard I had worked and this summer I was promoted to my new role as Head of Academy. It was great to know that the club have a sense of trust in me to put me in that position. I now oversee the whole programme so have a say in the Academy structure, oversee coaches, and help with the development of over 100 players from U9s to U16s. \n \"When I joined the PPCS my aim was to get a full-time job somewhere in football and the programme has helped me do that.\" \n How is this different from the previous roles you had at Burton during your placement? \n \"I delegate and oversee the structure of how to do things, to make sure that the Academy is in line with the overall club philosophy and playing philosophy.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Courtney Pitt in action in his debut season for Portsmouth in 2001/02\n             \n \n What are the biggest challenges in your role? \n \"In all honesty everyone seems aligned to help. Whether they become professional footballers or not, one of the key priorities is to ensure players have the necessary life skills that can be transferred so that if they don't make it into our first team, we have given them some skills in life to succeed. \n \"Only a tiny percentage of players get through their Scholarship, Academy and sign as a pro, so the emphasis on developing well-rounded people in the Academy is crucial.\" \n How important has PPCS been in providing the placement within the club, alongside the development provision provided by the League? \n \"The scheme got me a position at a football club, which had been so difficult to do. I was given an opportunity of actually getting in to a club to show what I could do, ride the challenge, learn and develop in myself. The PPCS has been a huge help for me to get a foot in the door and supporting me as I develop. It's great to see new cohorts too, and important that the scheme continues to grow and thrive.\" \n How important is it for a club academy to have more diversity among the coaching staff? \n \"It's so important to have a greater presence of minority groups, especially in leadership roles. You've got to be qualified, got to be the right person, however if you have the same group of people having the same conversations, you are never going to get a different perspective or ideas, it stays the same. \n \"Uncomfortable conversations need to be had sometimes because otherwise things won't change. There's a lot of players from different backgrounds and it's important that you can relate to them, and that they can relate to you.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n What do you think about being one of six PPCS participants who have gone on to attain full-time coaching roles in the professional game? \n \"There's six of us who have participated on the scheme including Jon-Paul Pittman at Forest Green Rovers, Eric Odhiambo at Coventry City and Darren Byfield, who is now involved with the first team at Crawley Town. A lot of us have got full-time roles as we have had the opportunity to prove our worth. We have our own WhatsApp group and encourage each other, set challenges, discuss things. \n \"The encouragement and support we have given each other over the past two years has been amazing. We're like-minded people who want to progress, want to do better and want to help people. I am proud of each and every one of us.\" \n What are your ambitions? \n \"I want to keep learning and improving. This has been a massive promotion for me and is a huge position. My first focus is on this role and hopefully in the next three to five years ideally see loads of Academy players make it through to the first team, or if not there, then in and around the Football League. \n Before it didn't feel like there were many options and certainly not many opportunities, so progress has been made with schemes like PPCS. I hope that if players from minority groups can see me and others making headway, they will see the potential and opportunity to follow if that's what they want to do. \n See:\u00a0 Coach Index to create more diverse coaching workforce \n \"If you can't see minority groups in leadership positions, and not just in football, it's easy to think that it's not attainable. I don't really see myself as a role model but if I can play a small role in helping others feel what I'm doing is attainable, then great. \n \"My priority though, is to help players develop and fulfil their dream of being a professional footballer in the first team. I know how special that is. If they don't make it as a professional, then my aim is to ensure that they are as well-equipped as possible, as a person, to work in a different environment.\" \n",

Ivan Toney  (\u00a37.2m),  Aleksandar Mitrovic  (\u00a36.6m) and  Callum Wilson  (\u00a37.4m) fall into this category in the mid-priced bracket.

Toney  has 25 points, returning eight, nine and eight points across the opening three Gameweeks. Toney now  faces Everton  in Gameweek 4. He registered nine points in this fixture last term and I suspect he will continue to be a good option, not just in Gameweek 4 but through until Gameweek 15.\u00a0 \n Nick\u00a0 ( @WGTA_Nick )\u00a0\u00a0 \n It's very early in the season so I do expect the premium assets to rediscover their form and reassert their dominance. But I have been impressed by the starts from  Wilfried Zaha  (\u00a37.0m) and  Mitrovic , who defences have really struggled to contain, and can see both racking up plenty of goals. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n I'm impressed with how  Toney  has started the season. He did well last year but looks to have improved, helping Brentford to be an attacking threat. The fixtures are good for him so I expect goals and assists to continue. \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n Gabriel Martinelli  (\u00a36.4m) looks set to continue his early-season form. He's undroppable given his current level of returns. It's great to see his link-up play with fellow Brazilian  Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a38.1m) too.\u00a0 \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n I transferred in  Toney  ahead of Gameweek 3 and I'm really excited to own him for the next wave of favourable fixtures.

I am very bullish on him and don't think it will be long before he's a must-have. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n With Nunez in mind, I left my third Liverpool slot open and I have no doubt he will be in my team soon. He changes the way they play and big chances seems to fall his way. \n \n \n \n Pras ( @Pras_fpl ) \n What the Spurs performance told me is that maybe this year we may see a few more goals shared around, in addition to the Kane and Son combination. \n Kulusevski impressed and is putting his hand up as the go-to \u00a38.0m midfielder. I see him as competition to similarly-priced players, rather than Son or Kane. I am also looking forward to seeing how  Richarlison  (\u00a38.5m) fits into the attack after he returns from suspension and whose minutes he eats up, even if coming on as a substitute. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n The third Liverpool spot will give managers headaches as it will require two transfers to switch through the positions.

        "text": "\n The Scout looks at the\u00a0 Fantasy Premier League \u00a0prospects of the three promoted sides in defence and attack. \n Nottingham Forest \n Brennan Johnson  was the star performer for Championship playoff winners  Nottingham Forest  in 2021/22. \n The 21-year-old scored 18 goals and also supplied 10 assists, both team-leading totals for Steve Cooper\u2019s side.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Although he can operate as a winger or support striker, Johnson mainly featured as a centre-forward after Cooper's arrival as manager in mid-September. His position in 2022/23 Fantasy is therefore expected to reflect that role. \n The underlying numbers further highlight the Wales international's huge influence on Forest's attack. \n His 94 shots and 68 shots in the box were both team-leading totals, while his 60 chances created ranked second. \n Johnson's playoff strike v Sheff Utd \n \n \n That man again \ud83c\udff9  \ud83c\udf33\ud83d\udd34  #NFFC   pic.twitter.com/zQ2hxuBgYU \n\u2014 Nottingham Forest FC (@NFFC)  May 17, 2022 \n \n All-round improvement \n Fellow forward  Lewis Grabban  improved his output under the new head coach, claiming 10 goals and three assists in 25 appearances.\u00a0 \n Cooper mainly preferred a 3-4-1-2 system, which lifted Forest\u2019s defensive output in 2021/22.\u00a0 \n Sixteen of their 17 clean sheets for the season came in his 38 matches at the helm, of which nine were at home and seven away. \n Forest goalkeeper  Brice Samba  was kept busy last term and his average of 31.5 minutes per save proved quicker than any promoted No 1. \n Centre-back  Scott McKenna  offers attacking potential, with two goals and three assists last term. \n However, Cooper\u2019s transfer business over the summer will be vital in assessing the Forest defence. \n New-look backline \n Djed Spence and Max Lowe thrived as wing-backs in 2021/22 but both players were on loan and have since returned to their parent clubs.\u00a0 \n Spence produced two goals and four assists in 41 outings, while Lowe combined one goal with four assists from 21 matches.\u00a0 \n Replacing Philip Zinckernagel, another loanee, is also likely to be a top priority. Playing in an advanced central role behind the front two, he scored six goals and assisted a further seven. \n Ultimately, it is Johnson who looks the go-to pick for Forest, although Cooper\u2019s new wing-backs will definitely be worth monitoring over a kind run of fixtures. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 Robinson an all-round prospect Part 2:\u00a0 Look to Mitrovic and Wilson for value Part 3:\u00a0 Rely on Travers for save points Part 4:  Solanke can deliver value \n",

I'm very tempted by Kane but Son\u2019s extra routes to points clinches a very tight call. \n \n \n \n Pranil Sheth ( @Lateriser12 ) \n Salah  is facing a promoted team again in Gameweek 1. He likes a Gameweek 1 hat-trick, and I'm here for it. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n He looked sharp in the Community Shield, he's recently signed a new contract and had the summer off -  Salah  is an easy captain choice for me. Historically, he starts campaigns very well.\u00a0 \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n I can't look past  Salah . He's scored in every Gameweek 1 fixture for  Liverpool , with a double-digit haul on four of those occasions.

However, I'll certainly be going for two premiums in my Gameweek 17 team, given  Mohamed Salah \u2019s (\u00a312.8m) time off and  Liverpool 's favourable fixtures. \n Nick ( @WGTA_Nick ) \n Haaland  has had a long break and I am expecting him to come back refreshed and fitter than ever. \n I expect he'll remain key to our teams, as we continue to build around him with a mixture of mid-priced players, another premium like  Salah  in midfield and cheaper enablers like  Miguel Almiron  (\u00a35.8m), who has also been well rested. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Having not played at the FIFA World Cup 2022, I can see  Haaland  and  Salah  being popular come Gameweek 17. Kane will be in the conversation but may well go deep into the tournament with England, so two premiums are probably enough for me. \n I'll balance those premiums with good budget options, like  Almiron  in midfield and  Kepa Arrizabalaga  (\u00a34.5m) in goal. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n For as long as  Haaland  is fit, he will be a set and forget. With so many good enablers in the game this season, owning three premium attacking players still feels very balanced. \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Having  Haaland  won\u2019t prevent me owning other premiums, as I'll look to own three premiums up front in Haaland,  Kane  and  Darwin Nunez  (\u00a39.0m), especially as there are so many nice budget-friendly picks in midfield. \n The likes of  Andreas Pereira  (\u00a34.6m), who has a  Double Gameweek 19 ,  Almiron  and  Dejan Kulusevski  (\u00a38.0m) all allow managers to have multiple premiums. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n Haaland  and  Salah  have both been well rested, having not featured at the World Cup, and with the emergence of value picks such as  Diogo Dalot  (\u00a34.8m),  Kieran Trippier  (\u00a35.9m),  Ben White  (\u00a34.7m) and  Pereira , it is easier than ever to get a third premium in. \n De Bruyne  or  Kane  alongside those two big-hitters is very much possible while keeping a balanced squad. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Best Newcastle picks Part 2:  Best Arsenal picks Part 3:  Best \u00a38.0m midfielders Part 5:\u00a0 Players to start considering due to World Cup \n",

With nice fixtures and an ownership of just 0.7 per cent, he could be a good differential. \n Lee Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n With Mitrovic facing a late check, I'll likely hold as Fulham's fixtures look good moving forward and he's their talisman.  \n If you want to replace him and are strapped for cash, consider  Danny Welbeck  (\u00a36.5m). He's been quoted in the press as \"excited\" to be playing under new head coach Roberto De Zerbi - and the Italian got a lot out of his No 9s at previous clubs. It's a bit of a gamble with  Brighton & Hove Albion 's fixtures, but keep an eye on him. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n It is hard to know what to do with the forward.\u00a0 If he is out for more than a week,  Callum Wilson  (\u00a37.2m) looks the standout replacement. He's scored three in four appearances for  Newcastle United  and when fit he guarantees goals. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n This is all about time, which sadly we don't always have.  Wilson  and  Welbeck  are both on my radar but, with two free transfers, I will even consider moving him down to bench fodder to boost my midfield. However, this is not ideal, with Blank Gameweek 12 on the horizon. \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n With Mitrovic's injury looking short term, Fantasy managers should consider benching him for a week if possible.  \n If you need a guaranteed starter for this week,  Wilson  is the best dependable option for a similar budget. At the lower end,  Dominic Solanke  (\u00a35.7m) still appeals for his price, fixtures and the fact that he's on penalties.  \n Other left-field options include  Scamacca ,  Welbeck ,  Anthony Martial  (\u00a36.9m),  Patson Daka  (\u00a35.7m) and  Ollie Watkins  (\u00a37.2m). \n Jamie Pigott ( @Futbolislifefpl ) \n I prefer to keep him, with AFC Bournemouth at home in Gameweek 11.\u00a0 But if managers want to make the change, I like  Wilson . When he's fit, he scores goals. \n See:\u00a0 Your essential FPL tips for Gameweek 10 \n GW10 deadline: 13:30 BST, Sat 8 Oct \n",

They scored 17 goals from set-pieces in 2021/22, the third highest in the division. \n With Wilson\u2019s wonderful left foot, expect plenty of chances created from dead-balls. \n Top passing stats in Championship \n \n \n \n Team \n Build-up attacks \n Team \n 10+ pass sequences \n \n \n \n \n FUL \n 172 \n SWA \n 725 \n \n \n SWA \n 120 \n FUL \n 645 \n \n \n SHU \n 107 \n BOU \n 451 \n \n \n BOU \n 84 \n QPR \n 434 \n \n \n QPR \n 74 \n SHU \n 414 \n \n \n \n One of Fulham\u2019s key traits under Silva is pinning opponents back with controlled periods of possession. \n Comfortable and patient on the ball, they produced 52 more build-up attacks than any other Championship side last term, and were behind only Swansea City for overall possession. \n How much possession will they enjoy in the Premier League? \n \n \n \n \n \n FUL \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 2 \n \n LIV \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n WOL \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 0 \n \n FUL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n FUL \n \n \n \n \n 3 - 2 \n \n BRE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n As a gauge, during the 2020/21 season, Fulham ranked 11th, with 49.4 per cent of the ball under  Scott Parker . This was after averaging 61.6 per cent in the Championship promotion campaign that preceded it. \n Last season they averaged 60.7 per cent of possession, so Fulham will likely opt for a balanced approach once again, with 50 per cent an achievable target. \n With Mitrovic at his best when crosses are sent in, it is unlikely they will sit back and become counter-attacking specialists. \n High tempo \n Fulham's style is not one-dimensional under Silva, so they should cope well with the tactical adaptations required. \n He encourages possession play, but also favours high-tempo football that sees his players press with great energy. \n Fulham were very strong in this department last term, with only Coventry City winning the ball more. \n Most shots/goals after high turnovers 21/22 \n \n \n \n Team \n Shots \n Goals \n \n \n \n \n COV \n 71 \n 6 \n \n \n FUL \n 66 \n 9 \n \n \n BOU \n 59 \n 6 \n \n \n \n Fulham\u2019s attacking prowess means they should carry a goal threat home and away in 2022/23. \n Their main concern could be how they cope defensively. \n Five Championship sides kept more clean sheets than Fulham last term, who on occasion looked vulnerable. \n In home defeats by Huddersfield Town,  Nottingham Forest , Sheffield United and Coventry, they struggled to deal with opponents who closed them down inside their own half. \n Having leaked 43 goals, almost one goal per match, Fulham may look to invest in several new defensive players. \n The Cottagers have plenty of talent and a clearly defined style. But they must still recruit well, especially at the back, if they are to avoid another relegation battle.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  Wilson to deliver for Fulham again Part 3:  Parker has the tools to succeed Part 4:  Kelly and Billing key for Cherries Part 5:  Forest counters can cause problems Part 6:  Johnson and Yates offer pace and craft \n",

Seven of his goals last term were scored with his right foot, and three using his left. \n He is a consistent creator of chances too. \n Even if he only provided only two assists in 2021/22, he averaged\u00a01.4 key passes per 90 minutes. \n He will bring imagination to the side on his return. \n Where will he fit in? \n Smith Rowe\u2019s most effective position last season was on the left of Arsenal\u2019s front three, the role occupied by\u00a0 Gabriel Martinelli \u00a0this term. \n It will not be easy to displace in-form Martinelli from the starting XI but, in the absence of the injured  Gabriel Jesus , Smith Rowe could be included on the left, with Martinelli pushed into a striker\u2019s role on occasion. \n Smith Rowe has shown his versatility in the past, shining in a box-to-box role as part of a midfield three, as a No 10 and on the right of Arteta\u2019s forward line. He has also featured sparingly as a \"false nine\" striker. \n Game-changing option \n Smith Rowe will initially give Arteta a tremendous game-changing option from the bench. \n He has a strong record as an impact substitute, scoring off the bench against  West Ham United ,  Leeds United  and Norwich City last season. \n Having featured for only 48 minutes this term, the England international will now be eager to play his part. \n His involvement during the second half of the campaign is sure to excite Arsenal fans. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  How Isak can fire Newcastle's top-four challenge Part 3:  Martial ready to be United's leading man after Ronaldo exit Part 4:  Fofana return can put Chelsea back on front foot \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at key tactical points and players who can be decisive in Matchweek 14. \n Nottingham Forest \n Leaders  Arsenal  will be favourites to win at home against bottom-of-the-table Forest this Sunday, but breaking down this increasingly stubborn side may not prove easy. \n \n \n \n \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n 5 - 0 \n \n NFO \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Steve Cooper \u2019s team  beat Liverpool 1-0  last time out with a magnificent, hard-working performance. \n They are showing signs of gelling as a group, conceding just twice across their last four Premier League matches. \n Meanwhile, Arsenal have looked a little fatigued in second halves of recent outings, so this contest could be tighter than many expect. \n Forest defence comparison 2022/23 \n \n \n \n Stats per 90 \n MW1-9 \n MW10-13 \n \n \n \n \n Shots faced \n 17.0 \n 13.8 \n \n \n Expected goals against (xGA) \n 1.8 \n 1.3 \n \n \n Goals conceded \n 2.6 \n 0.5 \n \n \n \n Forest\u2019s improvement owes plenty to the form of defenders  Scott McKenna  and  Steve Cook , along with midfielder  Ryan Yates . \n All three were key men during an unforgettable promotion campaign and in a new 4-3-3 formation their reliable and diligent off-the-ball work is integral to the team's prospects of success. \n The trio were outstanding against  Liverpool , making a combined 24 clearances. McKenna led the way with 10 of his own.\u00a0Across the season, they are Forest\u2019s top three player for clearances, headed clearances and blocks. \n The contributions from right-back  Serge Aurier  and left-back  Neco Williams  have also been crucial. \n Both full-backs are attack-minded by nature, but they have been in terrific form defensively of late. Aurier won six of the seven tackles he attempted against Liverpool. \n Assertive in the air \n In the last four matches, Forest have only conceded goals from a  Ruben Neves penalty  and a spectacular long-range strike by  Ashley Young  in a  1-1 draw with Aston Villa . \n Defensively, they have made very few mistakes and none have been costly. \n Working hard, Cooper\u2019s side have kept a solid 4-3-3 shape, which sometimes turns into a 5-4-1, depending on the situation. \n Forest try to be assertive inside the middle third, but at times they will sit back and defend deep. \n This is likely to be a ploy at Emirates Stadium. By staying compact, the visitors can encourage Arsenal to throw hopeful crosses into the area. \n Forest crosses faced last four matches \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n Crosses \n Open-play crosses \n \n \n \n \n v AVL \n 20 \n 16 \n \n \n v WOL \n 22 \n 16 \n \n \n v BHA \n 27 \n 18 \n \n \n v LIV \n 30 \n 15 \n \n \n \n In such situations, McKenna and Cook are brilliant at winning their aerial duels. They are ably supported by Yates, who regularly drops back in to act as a supplementary central defender. \n Together, Forest's backline have successfully repelled 99 crosses in their last 360 minutes of action. \n Set-piece issues \n Forest will rightly feel proud of their shock success against Liverpool, but they struggled to contain their opponents from set-piece situations. \n As the table below shows, four of Liverpool\u2019s biggest five chances stemmed from dead-balls. \n Liverpool's best chances v Forest \n \n \n \n Player \n Chance type \n xG* \n \n \n \n \n Fabio Carvalho \n Open play \n 0.38 \n \n \n Roberto Firmino \n Corner \n 0.22 \n \n \n Virgil van Dijk \n Corner \n 0.17 \n \n \n Mohamed Salah \n Wide free-kick \n 0.13 \n \n \n Roberto Firmino \n Corner \n 0.12 \n \n \n \n * Expected Goals tally: the likelihood of a goal being scored, out of one \n Forest\u2019s marking set-up was fragile, with several Reds players missing gilt-edged opportunities despite being free inside the area. \n Only  AFC Bournemouth  have conceded more set-piece goals than Forest's six, while Arsenal have scored five goals from corners and free-kicks already this term. \n If Forest can stray strong in such situations, they have a chance of taking another big scalp this weekend. \n Also in this series \n See:  Pacy Kehrer the perfect partner for Zouma \n",

It was named The Sunday Times Sixth Form College of the Year in 2020, sending more than 30 students to Oxbridge and many more to Russell Group universities. \n Jan, who has masterminded partnerships with independent schools across London to support his students\u2019 learning and success, has been the school\u2019s head since it opened in 2017 and has been awarded the Community Captain prize for his enthusiasm, inspiration and dedication to the students.\u00a0 \n The Community Captain accolade is being given to more than 100 members of the public who have made an outstanding contribution to their club and local community, as part of the Premier League\u2019s 30th anniversary celebrations.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Presentations to the Captains form part of the Premier League Trophy Tour, which is visiting more than 50 professional, non-league and women\u2019s clubs across England and Wales who receive funding from the Premier League.\u00a0 \n 'Inspired hundreds of students' \n Defoe said: \u201cI am so excited to be here to give Jan this award today. He is someone who has inspired hundreds of students on their way to success, including helping those with disadvantaged backgrounds achieve their potential. \n \"Growing up in the East End of London, I would have loved an opportunity like this to further my education and fulfil my dreams.\u201d \u00a0 Jan said: \u201cWinning the award is a great symbol of the work that has gone on here in the last five years. \n \"I am proud of myself, but more importantly, proud of all the students that have studied here, all the staff and the club who have made the school what it is today. \n \u201cStudying in the environment of an elite institution like Tottenham Hotspur raises the bar for the students and I am so thankful to be part of the academy and encourage more young people within our community to make the most of this opportunity that exists on their doorstep.\u201d \n Fulfilling potential \n One of the pupils at LAET attending the presentation said: \u201cJan is so deserving of this award. He has given us so many opportunities, as well as the academic rigor needed to get to the top and fulfil our potential.\u201d \n A driving ethos behind the club building its new stadium was the regeneration of the local area and the opportunities it would bring to young people in our community. \n The Club provides financial backing and facilities for LAET and also helped raise \u00a330,000 in an auction of player-signed merchandise to extend its mental health provision for students.\u00a0 \n See:\u00a0 Premier League Trophy Tour stories \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout\u2019s  panel of experts  discuss their chip strategies for the reduced Gameweek 8 round of fixtures in  Fantasy Premier League . \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n For a lot of FPL managers it will be possible to get close to a full team out this Gameweek, and therefore it will be OK to play through without a chip. However, now could be a good time to Wildcard if you want to make changes to your team. \n There are big fixture swings for teams such as  Arsenal . By Wildcarding now, managers could target those with the best long-term fixtures, as well as picking some differentials for GW8. It also allows managers to use the money from Blank Gameweek 8 players such as  Trent Alexander-Arnold  (\u00a37.5m) and  Mohamed Salah  (\u00a312.9m) rather than just benching them. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n It's a good time to Wildcard and I've activated mine this week. A shift away from  Salah , a change of goalkeeper and a switch of formation with three in-form strikers up top are all on the agenda.\u00a0 \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n The Free Hit chip will likely be useful later in the season when we have Blank Gameweeks due to cup fixtures. It's a great time to use the Wildcard now. You can leave players like  Wilfried Zaha  (\u00a37.2m) and  James Maddison  (\u00a37.9m) on your bench for later and still put out a great XI. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n If you can get 10 players with a four-point hit, there's no need to use a chip. I'd be OK with just nine players if you have the main options covered, such as the Arsenal attack and  Newcastle United  defence. If you're happy with your squad, but lacking players this week, Free-Hitting looks fine as Blank Gameweeks are the best use for this. If you are unhappy with the current team and lacking players, I'd Wildcard, knowing we have unlimited free transfers in Gameweek 16. \n Paul Gee ( @FPLPaulGee ) \n This is a team-dependent decision, but if you can't field a full XI with a four-point hit, I would Wildcard. The fixtures swings of Newcastle,  Fulham  and  West Ham United  might make it work out. That Liverpool have a Blank Gameweek and then go on a tough run might make the switch from Salah on a Wildcard a bit easier. \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n Now is a great time to Wildcard. Drop underperforming assets from Liverpool as their fixtures turn and bring in players with favourable fixtures. If you've already used the Wildcard, take points hits to improve your long-term squad this week and save the Free Hit for later in the season.\u00a0 \n Pras ( @Pras_fpl ) \n If you have six or seven missing players this weekend, a chip must be deployed. If you have both the Wildcard and Free Hit available, the former may be better due to the tough fixture runs of Arsenal and  Brighton & Hove Albion . Offloading their players on a Wildcard may not be a bad thing. It makes sense to use the Wildcard over the Free Hit since we have to use one before Gameweek 16 anyway. \n The Free Hit chip may be needed later down the line when either the Gameweek 7 matches are rescheduled, or during the FA Cup quarter-finals Blank Gameweek. If you can put out a strong team this week (even with a -4) without using a chip, there is merit in saving the Wildcard chip for the international break or Gameweeks 12 or 13. \n Jamie Pigott\u00a0 ( @Futbolislifefpl ) \n Gameweeks 8, 9, 12 appear the best strategic times to Wildcard, based on fixtures. \u00a0Wildcard decisions are always team-dependent but if you have three or four blanks and are struggling to get to XI without more than a -4, Wildcarding is perfectly fine. I wouldn't play a Free Hit, save for Double Gameweeks later in the season where there is more upside. \n Sonaldo ( @FPL_Sonaldo ) \n I believe the Free Hit chip will become extremely useful later in the season. Usually a Free Hit would work best in a Blank Gameweek. If you can\u2019t get to 10 starters without hits this week, playing the Wildcard makes sense. With just nine Gameweeks until the FIFA World Cup, it\u2019s just about the right amount of time to maximise the Wildcard. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Gameweek 8: What FPL managers need to know Part 2:  How to approach reduced Gameweek 8 Part 3:\u00a0 GW8 Ones to watch: Mitrovic to continue goal run Part 4:  GW8 Differentials: Isak has schedule to thrive Part 5:  FPL expert: Who to put in your Free Hit team Part 7:\u00a0 GW8 Captains: De Bruyne and Kane can rival Haaland Part 8:  Scout Selection: Best FPL team for Gameweek 8 \n GW8 deadline: 18:30 BST Friday 16 Sept \n",

This may in part be down to an attack-minded mentality of managers. \n In recent seasons there has been a fall in managers adopting defensive deep-lying tactics.  Leeds United ,  Brentford ,  Fulham  and  AFC Bournemouth  are good examples of promoted teams who have had a positive style of play. None are defensive. Swapping a central defender for an extra forward player makes sense when your focus is on scoring goals.\u00a0 \n The sight of more opponents lining up in a 4-3-3 will also put off some managers who prefer back threes. Most would feel more comfortable with a four-man defence facing three forwards. \n It's a similar story for the 4-2-3-1. In the case of Brighton, Brentford, Wolves and  Nottingham Forest , who ditched a back three early on this season, they were all short of goals. Bringing in an extra creative player was needed to provide a greater threat.\u00a0 \n Starting formations compared \n \n \n \n Formation \n 21/22 total \n 22/23 total \n \n \n \n \n 4-3-3 \n 185 \n 92 \n \n \n 4-2-3-1 \n 163 \n 86 \n \n \n 4-4-2 (classic) \n 90 \n 17 \n \n \n 3-4-2-1 \n 68 \n 24 \n \n \n 3-5-2 \n 57 \n 16 \n \n \n \n The five most-used shapes remain the same this season. The only change in the order from the end of 2021/22 is the 4-4-2 (classic) being replaced in third spot by 3-4-2-1. \n Former Burnley manager  Sean Dyche  consistently used 4-4-2, which explains this change in light of his departure and the Clarets' relegation. \n Meanwhile, ex- Southampton  head coach  Ralph Hasenhuttl  opted to try new formations this season before he left St Mary\u2019s in early November. \n In general we have seen a drop in top-flight managers using two centre-forwards. \n Last season 28 per cent of formations contained a twin strike force, but during the early weeks of this campaign, the figure stands at just 19.5 per cent. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:\u00a0 Home wins close to a record high Part 3:\u00a0 How corners are a growing threat Part 4:  Fewer crosses and more clinical finishing \n",

Seven individuals featured for over 3,000 of the 3,420 total minutes. \n Maximum efficiency \n Leicester's spine in 2015/16 was rock solid, and they were inspired by a sensational debut season from new signing N\u2019Golo Kante.\u00a0 \n The little-known French midfielder cost \u00a35.6million from Caen and was a revelation in central midfield. His 175 tackles and 156 interceptions were the most in the division.\u00a0 \n The Foxes' resolute defensive shape proved hard to break down. And rival teams, perhaps showing a degree of complacency, continued to leave themselves open to counter-attacks.\u00a0 \n On those fast breaks the brilliance of Riyad Mahrez, who scored 17 goals and added 11 assists, and Jamie Vardy (24 goals, six assists) regularly made the difference. \n Least possession for PL champions \n \n \n \n Season \n Champions \n Ave. possession \n \n \n \n \n 2015/16 \n Leicester \n 42.43% \n \n \n 2016/17 \n Chelsea \n 54.75% \n \n \n 2004/05 \n Chelsea \n 55.37% \n \n \n 2014/15 \n Chelsea \n 55.78% \n \n \n 2010/11 \n Man Utd \n 56.11% \n \n \n \n Realising their goal threat was enhanced by game plans that revolved around transitions, Leicester are the only champions to have adopted a non-possession-based strategy.\u00a0 \n Their average possession figure (42.43 per cent) is by some distance the lowest on record for a Premier League winning team, since such data started being collected in 2003/04. \n The quirkiest of seasons \n Leicester\u2019s points jump of 40 from 2014/15 to 2015/16 remains the second-highest leap ever seen in the competition.\u00a0 \n It was enough to steer them to top spot, 10 points ahead of  Arsenal  in second place. \n Biggest PL points increases \n \n \n \n Season \n Team \n Points jump \n \n \n \n \n 2016/17 \n Chelsea \n 43 \n \n \n 2015/16 \n Leicester \n 40 \n \n \n 2000/01 \n Ipswich \n 39 \n \n \n 1994/95 \n Nott'm Forest \n 37 \n \n \n 2018/19 \n Wolves \n 32 \n \n \n \n When you compare the Foxes' numbers from 2014/15 and 2015/16 it is surprising to note that there was not a major shift in terms of shots, shots faced or the amount of possession they enjoyed.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n 2014/15 \n Leicester \n 2015/16 \n \n \n \n \n 41 \n Points \n 81 \n \n \n 12 \n Total shots/90 \n 13.7 \n \n \n 14.6 \n Shots faced/90 \n 13.6 \n \n \n 42.9 \n Possession % \n 42.4 \n \n \n \n What we witnessed that season was a very special collective effort that enabled an experienced team to produce peak efficiency in the defensive, middle and final thirds.\u00a0 \n In the moments that mattered at both ends of the pitch, they delivered consistently.\u00a0 \n Ranieri's relaxed demeanour took the pressure off his players, who went on to ride a spectacular and unexpected wave for the entirety of a season that will never be forgotten.\u00a0 \n Leicester's magnificent achievement in 2015/16 has, and will continue to, inspire other teams and individuals across all sports at every level.\u00a0 \n They proved that nothing is impossible.\u00a0 \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Leicester's title miracle Part 3:  Leicester's miracle - Where are they now? \n",

there are periods in each contest where the Cherries drop off into a mid-to-low block and keep their shape under pressure, O\u2019Neil has instilled a belief in the squad that they can consistently score goals.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Moving away from the cautious 5-2-3 or 3-4-2-1 that AFC Bournemouth set up in at the start of 2022/23, the new Cherries head coach prefers a 4-4-2 or 4-2-3-1 that includes an extra attacking player.\u00a0\u00a0 \n He is not averse to using a back three either, especially as a mid-match tweak.\u00a0\u00a0 \n While a tough fixture list at the start of the campaign should come into consideration, under O\u2019Neil, AFC Bournemouth have certainly been more dangerous inside the final third.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Fashioning almost twice as many shots inside the opposition box per 90 minutes, their goals and Expected Goals numbers have effectively trebled.\u00a0\u00a0 \n More creative freedom \u00a0 \n AFC Bournemouth\u2019s attacking players were in excellent form during the latter stages of O\u2019Neil\u2019s caretaker spell.\u00a0\u00a0 \n In the final three matches before the break for the FIFA World Cup 2022, the Cherries scored eight goals, with  Marcus Tavernier  (two goals and four assists),  Kieffer Moore  (three goals),  Dominic Solanke  (one goal) and  Philip Billing  (one goal) all highly influential figures.\u00a0 \n Tavernier's goal v Everton \n \n \n

played on both wings but has noticeably made an effort to get inside the box on a far more frequent basis \u2013 and he has been rewarded with a fabulous run of direct goal involvements.\u00a0\u00a0 \n O\u2019Neil\u2019s decision to pair Solanke with Moore up front in recent matches has also made a difference.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Playing as a support striker, Solanke\u2019s all-round game has come to

This kept them out of title contention, so Klopp focused on defending from the front. \n Their intense closing-down helped protect a rather unreliable backline. \n In 2015/16, Liverpool pressed ferociously, winning possession inside the final third five times per match. \n It was a number they were unable to match in the following three seasons. But in 2019/20 they rediscovered their appetite for closing down in advanced areas. \n Liverpool topped the Premier League rankings, winning the ball back 6.7 times per 90 minutes inside the final third. \n Liverpool goals conceded\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \u00a0Season \n Goals conceded (PL rank) \n Set-piece goals conceded (PL rank) \n \n \n \n \n 2015/16 \n 50 (8th) \n 15 (18th) \n \n \n 2016/17 \n 42 (5th) \n 12 (12th) \n \n \n 2017/18 \n 38 (4th) \n 8 (7th) \n \n \n 2018/19 \n 22 (1st) \n 8 (2nd) \n \n \n 2019/20 \n 21 (1st) \n 5 (5th) \n \n \n \n Between 2016 and 2018, Klopp signed  Joel Matip ,  Andrew Robertson ,  Virgil van Dijk ,  Fabinho  and goalkeeper  Alisson , all highly significant acquisitions. \n During that period he also introduced academy graduate  Trent Alexander-Arnold , turning him into a first-team regular and a star of their starting XI. \n The then 21-year-old was named  2019/20\u00a0TAG Heuer Young Player of the Season  and was one of several top-class defenders to make a difference at the back. \n Liverpool conceded considerably fewer goals in 2019/20, and a longstanding vulnerability at set-pieces was eradicated. \n The presence of a dominant goalkeeper in Alisson and imposing centre-back in Van Dijk made a monumental difference. \n A more rounded team \n Klopp\u2019s Liverpool have always played at a relentlessly high tempo, but in the seasons leading up to 2019/20 they continually added strands to their tactical options. \n Upgrading full-backs  Nathaniel Clyne  and  Alberto Moreno  by bringing in Alexander-Arnold and Robertson was a real turning point. \n Liverpool threat from out wide \n \n \n \n \u00a0Season \n Open-play crosses/90 (PL rank) \n Long passes/90 (PL rank) \n Set-piece goals (PL rank) \n \n \n \n \n 2015/16 \n 14.7 (9th) \n 62 (17th) \n 16 (7th) \n \n \n 2016/17 \n 14.8 (7th) \n 68 (13th) \n 20 (3rd) \n \n \n 2017/18 \n 14.4 (5th) \n 62 (15th) \n 13 (11th) \n \n \n 2018/19 \n 12.8 (7th) \n 59 (15th) \n 29 (1st) \n \n \n 2019/20 \n 18.0 (2nd) \n 64 (5th) \n 17 (1st) \n \n \n \n With both full-backs supplying quality end product from wide areas, Mane and Salah were able to move infield and become additional strikers. \n That made opponents wary of dropping too deep and giving them time on the ball. \n In 2019/20, Liverpool were just as threatening when they pinned sides back as they were on quick transitions. \n Alexander-Arnold\u2019s outstanding set-piece deliveries added a threat, while the full-backs' ability to strike long passes with unerring accuracy meant Liverpool could change the point of their attack quicker than in the past. \n It was a feature of the team\u2019s development in 2019/20, and those lengthy passes also increased the side\u2019s potency on the break. \n Deserving champions \n Liverpool\u2019s progress under Klopp was gradual but impressive. \n In 2019/20, they reached a point where they became a sophisticated team who successfully combined force with finesse. \n It is difficult to find flaws in the Reds' long-awaited but highly impressive title-winning campaign. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  PL30: Klopp's champions Part 3:  PL30: Klopp's first XI compared to his title-winning side \n",

0 \n \n NFO \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n There is a great sense of momentum and unity at the City Ground, built around the amazing transformation since head coach  Steve Cooper \u00a0took charge last September. \n Cooper is acclaimed by the Forest faithful, having galvanised a struggling team languishing in the relegation zone and steered them to promotion through the Championship playoffs.\u00a0 \n The Reds averaged two points per match over his 38 fixtures during the regular season, and would theoretically have finished as champions on 92 points had he been there from the start. \n Main formation \n Cooper settled Forest into a 3-4-1-2 formation during an outstanding second half of the campaign, but it is a relatively little-used shape in the Premier League. \n In last season\u2019s competition, no team employed that system as their primary formation. \n It was used on just 15 occasions, with  Thomas Tuchel  the man to choose it the most - seven times with  Chelsea . \n Cooper's formations in 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Formation \n Times used \n \n \n \n \n 3-4-1-2 \n 24 \n \n \n 4-2-3-1 \n 7 \n \n \n 3-4-3 \n 5 \n \n \n 3-4-2-1 \n 4 \n \n \n 3-5-2 \n 1 \n \n \n \n Cooper is a fan of this shape, using it 25 times when he was Swansea City\u2019s head coach in 2020/21. \n It has also happened to be a formation that has suited his key players at Forest.\u00a0 \n A back three of  Joe Worrall ,  Steve Cook  and  Scott McKenna  is not blessed with great pace but it has given Forest safety in numbers and the unit have gelled together. \n Djed Spence, on loan from Middlesbrough, was ideal as a right wing-back last term, while Philip Zinckernagel - loaned from Watford - was at his best in a free No 10 role. \n It will be interesting to see who will play these roles in the Premier League.\u00a0 \n New role for Johnson \n Cooper has also been keen to start his most dangerous attacker,  Brennan Johnson , in a striker\u2019s role where he can run in behind the last man. \n Having previously operated as a winger, and unaccustomed to playing up front, the Welshman has worked best alongside a natural centre-forward. \n Johnson goal v Sheff Utd \n \n \n 1\ufe0f\u20e38\ufe0f\u20e3 goals this season for  #OneOfOurOwn  \ud83c\udff9  \ud83c\udf33\ud83d\udd34  #NFFC   pic.twitter.com/DWJDB19OU3 \n\u2014 Nottingham Forest FC (@NFFC)  May 14, 2022 \n \n It would be a surprise to see Forest deviate away from 3-4-1-2 in the early stages of 2022/23, but much will depend on who they recruit this summer. \n If they are unable to keep hold of loanees  James Garner  and  Keinan Davis  as well as Spence and Zinckernagel, Cooper is likely to target players of a similar style to maintain this shape. \n Top attacking\u00a0Championship teams 21/22 \n \n \n \n Team \n Direct attacks \n Fast breaks \n Shots from fast breaks \n \n \n \n \n NFO \n 97 \n 33 \n 28 \n \n \n COV \n 97 \n 30 \n 25 \n \n \n BLB \n -

        "text": "\n LGBTQ+ fan group  Foxes Pride  has been awarded with the Premier League Community Captain accolade by  Leicester City  in recognition of their campaign work with the club, helping to combat homophobia in football and creating a safer and more inclusive environment for all fans. \n Leicester manager  Brendan Rodgers  and captain  Jonny Evans  met with Foxes Pride founder Graeme Smith and members Fiona Barber and Paul Malley, at the Foxes training ground, to present the trio with Community Captain armbands and a Premier League pennant. \n The presentation is the latest on the  Premier League 30 Year Trophy Tour , where Community Captain accolades are being awarded to members of the public, who have made an outstanding contribution to their club and local community. \n See:  Updates from the PL30 Trophy Tour \n A plaque engraved with the group\u2019s name, was also added to the Premier League Trophy plinth as part of the seven-week tour of England and Wales. \n The voluntary supporter group was established in 2015 and since then, Foxes Pride have established a great partnership with Leicester City and grown to include more than 200 LGBTQ+ members and allies. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Rodgers said: \"This Community Captain award is a testament to the great work Foxes Pride do to promote inclusion and equality. \n \"On behalf of Leicester City, I wish them all the very best as they continue with their great work to make the game more inclusive.\u201d \n Foxes Pride has met with the club on a number of occasions and last year spoke with Brendan Rodgers and a group of senior players, including  Marc Albrighton ,  James Maddison ,  Youri Tielemans , Evans and  Jamie Vardy  to share some of their experiences and discuss taking positive action to support LGBTQ+ fans. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Vardy gifted Foxes Pride the rainbow corner flag he kicked in celebration, after scoring a last-minute winner against Sheffield United in December 2020 to show his support for the group. \n Smith explained: \u201cIn his customary way, Jamie Vardy celebrated a goal by kicking the corner flag, which happened to have a rainbow flag on it. That image was misused on social media and online in a homophobic way. \n \"We worked with the club to send a positive message from this, the club retrieved that corner flag and Jamie Vardy signed it with a message of his support. This will be framed and put on permanent display in the club shop. \n \u201cThe first time I saw the Leicester City team posing with the rainbow flag meant a huge amount to me as a gay man. It showed me that players were prepared to stand up against homophobia, LGBTQ-phobia and transphobia. \n \"We still get reports that people are happy to use homophobic words in stadiums and we want to work towards a situation where football does feel safe for all. \n \n \n \"The first time I saw the Leicester City team posing with the rainbow flag meant a huge amount to me as a gay man\" \n \n Graeme Smith, Foxes Pride \n \n \n \n \u201cMeeting Brendan and meeting Jonny has been a fantastic experience and it's great that we have these opportunities to share the importance of being an ally and an advocate for the LGBTQ community.\u201d \n Evans said: \"Football is for all, it is for everyone, and we as players want to get that message across by showing our support and denouncing any language that may be used in a stadium which is totally unacceptable - until we get to the stage where we aren\u2019t hearing it at all.\u201d \n Making football an inclusive environment \n The Premier League is committed to making football an inclusive environment for all and is proud to continue working with clubs and Stonewall on the Rainbow Laces campaign, to help promote diversity and encourage allyship. \n This includes the creation of educational resources, available for free through Premier League Primary Stars, which encourage conversation around gender stereotypes. \n New PL commitments to fans \n During the Trophy Tour, the League will be announcing new financial commitments to benefit fans and communities. \n This includes increased investment into the Premier League Fans\u2019 Fund, with \u00a35m available to support fan engagement projects across the top four divisions of the football pyramid. \n The League is also investing an additional \u00a313.5million into the Football Foundation to create small-sided pitches in the heart of communities that need them the most. \n The tour will also give an opportunity to highlight new Premier League investment into women\u2019s and girls\u2019 football, including the Emerging Talent Centres announced earlier this summer. \n Across England and Wales, Premier League investment supports the community organisations of all 92 Premier League and English Football League clubs, plus the 68 National League clubs. \n \u00a31.6bn to communities and wider game \n Over the next three years, the League will continue its world-leading levels of support by contributing \u00a31.6billion to communities and the wider game. \n Premier League Chief Executive Richard Masters said: \u201cAs we mark 30 years since the Premier League first kicked off, it is important we celebrate the unsung heroes who deliver brilliant work in their communities. These people \u2013 whether they are participants, coaches, volunteers or long-time employees \u2013 are the lifeblood of their clubs and their communities. \n \u201cThe continued success of Premier League football enables us to provide unprecedented investment in communities and wider football. As we look to the future, we are committed to investing more than ever, to help develop the game and provide opportunities to people of all ages.\u201d \n",

        "text": "\n As the Premier League celebrates exactly 30 years since it first kicked off, some of the players to have graced the competition have been sharing their memories of that opening day and their favourite moments in the three decades since. \n Former players who featured in the PL30 advert, that has just gone live, have recalled their favourite players, incidents or celebrations.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Jamie Redknapp \n On the Premier League's 30th anniversary: \"Three decades of the Premier League is incredible when you think about it. All the great memories, great goals and magic moments. When it first started, people weren\u2019t immediately receptive - but my goodness didn\u2019t it take off? \n \"The Premier League has done a great job for football. It has changed everything, it's given players and managers a real platform to be superstars and that's why I think it is the best league in the world.\" \n On its most iconic moment: \"Blackburn winning the Premier League at Anfield was an amazing day. I was involved as a player from  Liverpool \u2019s side so it wasn\u2019t the perfect scenario because I'd much rather have been trying to win the league. \n \u201cEveryone in the stadium wanted Blackburn to win the league that year because they were vying against  Manchester United  and my dad was managing  West Ham  against them. \n \"It made for one of the most bizarre occasions because before the game Liverpool fans were coming up to us saying 'make sure you don\u2019t win today' because they didn't want United to win the league, so it put us in a very difficult position. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n \"West Ham managed to get a draw against  Sir Alex Ferguson 's Man Utd and we ended up beating Blackburn. It sort of worked out the perfect day and kept all the fans happy. I\u2019ve never been in a stadium where everyone is in jubilation. Liverpool fans were buzzing that United hadn't won it and Blackburn fans were on such a high to win the league.\" \n Micah Richards \n On his favourite Premier League moment: \"As a player, my favourite moment has to be [Sergio]  Aguero  [winning the title 2011/12]. It can't be topped. \n \"If you look at when the ball was played into Aguero, it was a striker's instinct. He waited, he dropped his shoulder and you think he\u2019s going to shoot across the goalkeeper, but he goes near side. A lot of people think he shanked it, but only Aguero could do that. It was an unbelievable moment and the best feeling ever of all that hard work coming together.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Favourite goal: \"My favourite goal in the Premier League has to be  Tony Yeboah 's [Goal of the Season against Wimbledon]. Remember when it hit the bar - it was ridiculous. Just the technique to hit it that hard and keep it that precise was unbelievable. He only scored screamers and because I\u2019m from Leeds, it was played over and over at school and wherever I went.\" \n On his favourite players: \" Dennis Bergkamp  was a genius. If you look at all these flair players you have now, he started it. When you study and look at his technical ability to find space and play the ball, he\u2019s got to be up there. \n \" Thierry Henry  had 'va va voom'. He just brought that sauce, I remember playing against him at right-back, he knocked it through my legs and turned around and gave me a little wink. He was impossible to mark.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Michael Owen \n On his favourite Premier League moment: \"Personally, I've got so many great memories in the Premier League. I think, coming back from the 1998 World Cup and scoring a hat-trick for Liverpool against  Newcastle  is right up there. Just because there was a lot of pressure at the time and I was only 18. \n \"I think people expected a lot from me at that point, so scoring a hat-trick - especially that third goal and the celebration that went with it, was a great moment. And then to score a last-minute winner for United in the Manchester derby was another good one.\" \n On the quality of the Premier League: \"A combination of things make the Premier League the best league in the world. We've always had the speed, it\u2019s not interrupted too often, and the players from different nations. It attracts the best players from around the world.\" \n On his favourite player: \"My favourite player in the Premier League for quality was Thierry Henry. I think he just lit up the league, he beat players, scored loads of goals, got lots of assists. He was just exciting and brought something different.\u00a0I think he was the best ever in the Premier League.\" \n Teddy Sheringham \n On his first Premier League goal: \"I don't think we all realised quite what the Premier League was going to become 30 years ago. It was a new thing and exciting times, there were dancing girls on a Monday night and it was all fandabidozi. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n \"I can remember scoring the first live goal on a Sunday afternoon for [Nottingham]  Forest  against Liverpool. What a goal to start off that era,  David James  was in goal and he looked huge - I remember thinking 'how am I going to score this?' so I hit it as hard as I could into the top corner.\" \n On Jurgen Klinsmann's 'dive' celebration: \"When  Jurgen Klinsmann  came over, he was a massive signing for  Tottenham Hotspur  and everyone was so excited at the time. Some people had said about him diving and we don\u2019t want him in English football. \n \"We were playing Sheffield Wednesday in his first game. Me and  David Kerslake  had a chat with him before the game and said if you score, to do a dive to take the mickey out of what he'd been portrayed as being. \n \"When he scored the first goal on that Saturday afternoon, he dived and we all dived on top of him. It was quite a funny moment for football fans and again when we came back to White Hart Lane, we told him he\u2019d have to do it again in front of the Tottenham fans and he did it again and they all loved it.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 Premier League celebrates 30th anniversary Part 3:  PL30: Test your knowledge of Premier League history \n",

        "text": "\n The Premier League has a vision to develop a world-leading coaching development system by elevating the quality of coaching across the English system through its\u00a0 Elite Coaching Plan .\u00a0\u00a0 \n As part of this, we are showcasing in a series of articles how the Premier League is leading a positive change in the global perception of our coaching at academy and first-team levels, as well as increasing the diversity of the coaching workforce. This includes interviews with some of the talented coaches coming up the ranks at Premier League clubs.\u00a0 \n Earlier this year, Adrian Clarke, spoke to Leicester City's\u00a0Chris Davies, one of the most highly respected and successful young coaches in English football. \n Chris Davies (LEI) \n In 12 years working alongside  Brendan Rodgers , first as a member of the backroom staff at Swansea City and  Liverpool , before becoming his assistant at Celtic and  Leicester City , the former Reading youth team player has played a part in several notable achievements. \n Still only 37, Davies' CV includes a promotion from the Championship, a role in one of the most exciting Premier League title races this century, back-to-back domestic trebles in Scotland and the masterminding of a first ever FA Cup Final triumph for Leicester. \n Taking time out of his busy schedule, Davies provides a wonderful insight into what it is like to be an assistant manager. \n Here, he breaks down his role and responsibilities, as well as telling us what he has learned as a No 2. \n Training ground dynamics \n \"I will lead the training day to day. That means I'll plan the sessions and manage the other coaches  Kolo Toure  and Adam Sadler on it, plus goalkeeping coach Mike Stowell. I'll then present my ideas to Brendan every morning. Normally it's, 'Good, happy with that,' and off we go,\" says Davies. \n \"Brendan will oversee and observe the training sessions. He will only intervene when he feels there is something he needs to say. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"Over the years he has gone from being really hands-on, taking pretty much every training session, to now trusting the staff more to deliver what he wants before picking his moments to come in. \n \"When it comes to the day before a match, things are different. Brendan will lead that session with the players. \n \"That's his game-planning day where the final details are laid out for the players. As the manager, he is rightly at the forefront of putting across those messages. It is something he has always done. \n Session plans \n \"As coaches we are all guided by the game model the manager puts in place. We know what sort of team we want to create, so there are specific details we are trying to cover each day. \n \"We've built up a huge database of session plans that are all bespoke to us, which is so useful. In the last few years, for logistical reasons, I've transferred from handwritten sessions to computer database sessions and it saves me hours! \n \"The challenge for myself and for all coaches is to make sure we are adding variety. You must stay open-minded to other types of sessions and learning from other content, so we can keep bringing new things to the table. \n \"If players have seen it all and your repertoire is used up, things can go stale. \n \"One thing Brendan and I have always done is engage with the existing staff, too. At Celtic, for example, we leant on John Kennedy, who is a brilliant coach, with some great ideas and sessions of his own. \n \"Sadler was already here at Leicester and he's great. I'll also go on courses and conferences as often as I can. \n \n \n \"\"If we are asking the players to perform and deliver at the very highest level then we, as a coaching staff, need to demand that of ourselves, and make sure we are at the very highest level too. You can't stand still.\"\" \n \n Chris Davies \n \n \n \n More than an assistant \n \"A big part of my job is to make sure Brendan only hears what is absolutely necessary or relevant. The assistant needs to be a buffer. \n \"Managers at this level can get saturated with information and too many tedious little things \u2013 and that's not what they need. If somebody has got an issue and I can deal with it, then I will always try to do that and encourage them to come to me first. \n \"To be fair to Brendan, he's got a huge energy for work and a real interest in every part of the club. He's always open to people knocking on his door, but an assistant's job is try and protect the manager. \n \"I want to help him make the big-money decisions with the clearest mind possible. \n Pre-match responsibilities \n \"I don't like it when an assistant goes around waving their arms and telling everyone what to do on a match day. Let the manager manage. By doing that, you give his words more weight and authority with the players. \n \"Before a game, I like to remind people of their jobs and reinforce the manager's current message, whatever that may be. \n \"I feel I'm pretty good at motivating the players, so I can be quite vocal and loud inside the dressing room. That said, sometimes you need to be softer and talk to them about calmness and having the confidence to get on the ball and play. \n \"It's our job to feel that emotional atmosphere inside the room. \n \"Personally, I also like to go around individually to embrace each player before they go out, to get a sense of what they need. \n \"Do they need that bit of edge from me? Or do they need someone to tell them it's all going to be alright? We must make sure the players are in the optimal place when they go out onto the pitch to do their jobs. \n In-game coaching \n \"During games I take a step back and focus on things from a strategic point of view. I don't like to get too involved emotionally in this decision, that decision. \n \"I've got a little thing I write on a notepad WIHH (What Is Happening Here). \n \"It's my way of coming out of the battle and looking at this from a purely tactical point of view. What is going on in this game? What does our team need? \n \"I'll advise on that throughout the game with Brendan and try to add some value. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"At half-time the four of us will sit around together and chat for five minutes, while the players are settling down, before Brendan delivers his message. \n \"In the second half, it's primarily about substitutions, that's the main way you can affect the game. I may talk to the physios to check in on the physical status of certain players during this period too. \n \"You are making judgment calls under pressure in grounds that have big atmospheres, so there isn't time for long-winded debates. \n \"When I talk to Brendan during the game, it has got to be snappy, to the point and have a good rationale.\" \n The value of experience in analysis \n \"All my experience was in youth coaching before taking a position as opposition analyst at Swansea when I was 25, and it was the best thing I could ever have done. \n \"In those five years [two at Swansea, three at Liverpool], my confidence grew enormously in terms of tactical awareness. \n \"To have real genuine knowledge meant I could go to a  Steven Gerrard , a  Jordan Henderson , any top player, with confidence, and talk to them about the game and be able to give them advice. \n \"I'm so pleased I did that job. There were times while I was doing it that I was wishing I was out there on the grass as a coach, but I wouldn't change it for the world. \n \"When I ended up at Reading as assistant manager, at the age of 30, I realised how valuable that job had been. Straightaway, I felt I could hold my own in conversations about tactics. My confidence soared and suddenly everything felt easy.\" \n Developing players \n \"I like to spend quality time analysing opponents and our own game. Those are the hard yards you need to put in, to deliver high-quality content and information back to the players. Analysing a match properly takes me three hours. \n \"Ever since my time at Liverpool, I've had individual player meetings and it's something I have continued since I became an assistant. \n \n \n \"\"I especially like working with midfielders because it was where I played, and it's probably the most complex position on the pitch in terms of the spaces around you.\" \n \n Chris Davies \n \n \n \n \"When I've got some clips to show them, I'll ask a player to come and meet me for a quick chat. It'll only usually be a 15-minute meet-up, where I pick out three things, max. \n \"Usually, I'd split my observations into two areas; decision-making and execution. Decision-making is tactics. Execution is technique. \n \"That development time, in the classroom if you like, is the most connection I have ever found with a player. \n \"By taking the time to go into detail about ways they can improve and feeding it back to them; that's a really strong relationship-builder between player and coach. \n \"They feel like you've gone the extra mile to help them and that's what players appreciate.\" \n Fine balance \n \"Because of the spotlight and exposure players are under, I am always very conscious about how I need to act and what I need to say, depending on whether the team is going well or not. \n \"Top-level players are under tremendous scrutiny these days. Every pass they make can be seen and discussed around the world, with people critiquing everything they have or haven't done, so having empathy with them is crucial. \n \"If it goes too far and you become a cheerleader 'not going to help them though. \n \"There's a fine balance that I've got better with, the more experience I have gained.\" \n Key ingredient \n \"If there is one quality you need to build from to be a good assistant manager, it is loyalty. Trust has to be base. \n \"Without it, the manager can never relax and know you've got his back. I pride myself on loyalty and trust above anything else. I'm here to support the manager every day, in whatever way I can. \n \n \n \"\"We are all part of the same team, the same club, we all want the same thing but there are internal dynamics at play so it's important that I protect Brendan. I also need to lead at the right times too.\" \n \n Chris Davies \n \n \n \n \"I don't see myself as an assistant in that sense. I see myself as a leader and I like to take on that role.\" \n Understanding your position \n \"You work very hard and dedicate yourself to the job, but it isn't actually your team and it's vital you remember that. \n \"As an assistant you have to be respectful of the boundaries and be aware it isn't your team. It belongs to the manager. They have all the pressure and responsibility. \n \"There's a bit of art to it, I guess. You need that huge work ethic and to embrace your key role in planning, but at the same time realise there are lines that can never be crossed. \n \"That is why the dynamic between manager and assistant is very complex.\" \n Future ambitions \n \"I don't think many people dream of being an assistant manager when they are older. Most want to coach their own team. \n \"When I first started working with Brendan, I did tell him that one day I would like to be a first-team manager. That was clear and it was a good starting point for us as a working relationship. \n \"That\u2019s the path I still want to go down, to be a manager at the right time. \n \"Whilst I'm doing this job, though, and it is a wonderful job to have, I'll always be completely focused and loyal to Brendan, and to know my role.\" \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Betsy: Focus on being the best coach you can Part 2:  Why Arsenal lead the way for counter-attacking goals Part 3:  Hobbs: Support for coaches is incredibly important Part 5:  Binnion: Coaches must be authentic with their players Part 6:  Jackson: Building connection with players is key to coaching \n",
