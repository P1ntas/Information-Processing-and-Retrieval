According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), five of the Magpies\u2019 next eight matches score only two. \n Newcastle's next eight fixtures \n \n \n \n GW \n Opp. \n FDR \n GW \n Opp. \n FDR \n \n \n \n \n 17 \n LEI (A) \n 2 \n 21 \n CRY (A) \n 3 \n \n \n 18 \n LEE (H) \n 2 \n 22 \n WHU (H) \n 2 \n \n \n 19 \n ARS (A) \n 4 \n 23 \n BOU (A) \n 2 \n \n \n 20 \n FUL (H) \n 2 \n 24 \n LIV (H) \n 4 \n \n \n \n No Arsenal attacker has amassed more points than Odegaard's 77. \n Meanwhile, Rodrigo has scored nine goals while playing as a forward in 2022/23.\u00a0 \n His average of 97.6 minutes per goal is second only to the 57.6 minutes per goal of Haaland among all regular starters this season. \n Tottenham Hotspur \u00a0winger\u00a0 Dejan Kulusevski  (\u00a38.0m) and  Crystal Palace \u00a0star\u00a0 Wilfried Zaha  (\u00a37.5m) will also not feature in Qatar, providing further options in midfield. \n Defensive picks \n At the back, Liverpool left-back  Andrew Robertson  (\u00a36.8m) and Arsenal centre-back  Gabriel  (\u00a35.2m) boast big potential at both ends of the pitch. \n Robertson supplied three of his four assists this season in his final three outings prior to the season break. \n Gabriel is the third top-scoring player in his position in 2022/23 Fantasy, combining two goals with seven clean sheets and nine bonus points. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Start Ward and free up funds Part 2:  Trippier an all-round star Part 3:\u00a0 Target goalscoring centre-backs Part 4:  Forward role helping Rodrigo thrive Part 5:  Foden maximising home fixtures Part 7:  Kane a strong partner for Haaland Part 8:\u00a0 Solanke revived under new head coach \n",

Barnes scored the opening goal in  Leicester City's 2-1 win over West Ham United . \n However, he opted to start  Callum Wilson  (\u00a37.3m) against  Chelsea  and was left disappointed when the forward was named on the bench. \n To make matters worse, Wilson was subbed on in the second half for a one-point return and blocked AZZURRI's substitutes from coming on and earning him points. \n That proved decisive, because he had  Ethan Pinnock\u00a0 (\u00a34.4m) as his first substitute.\u00a0 \n The  Brentford  defender combined a goal with a clean sheet and three bonus points to produce a 15-point haul in the Bees'  1-0 win against Man City . \n Had Wilson not come on, Amr would have been named this season's FPL champion. \n Joanne Hales-Owen 's  Twist Tigers  ended up joint-third, which is the highest finish by a woman manager in Fantasy.\u00a0 \n Prizes for winner \n - Seven-night break in the UK including VIP hospitality at two 2023/24 Premier League matches - Week\u2019s worth of experiences at popular tourist attractions courtesy of Visit Britain\u00a0 - Hublot Connected watch - Copy of FIFA 23 - Laptop computer/smartphone - Noise-cancelling Bluetooth headphones\u00a0 - Nike manager jacket - FPL goody bag consisting of a rucksack, t-shirt, mug, water bottle, stress ball, pen, pad and key ring \n",

        "summary": "The Scout's panel of experts discuss how to plan for GW17 and beyond the FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "\n With the FIFA World Cup bringing a pause to  Fantasy Premier League  after this Gameweek, FPL managers will be able to make unlimited free transfers following Saturday's deadline and before the Premier League returns for Gameweek 17 on 26 December. \n The Scout's  panel of experts  discuss how they are going to plan ahead. \n See:\u00a0 FPL and FIFA World Cup: All you need to know about free transfers \n What the experts say \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n The unlimited transfer window is a really exciting time for FPL managers. With player prices frozen during the World Cup this will be an opportunity for managers to focus on the players that they think are \"must haves\" rather than catching and avoiding the changes. \n Players like  Miguel Almiron  (\u00a35.8m),  Mohamed Salah  (\u00a312.7m) and  Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.1m) will not be playing at the World Cup and will therefore be key targets for managers. \n Others will depend on how far their countries progress in the World Cup. I will also be looking at  Southampton  players as part of my unlimited transfer plans. With their new manager having time to work with his side during the World Cup and a great run of fixtures through to Gameweek 23, players like  Che Adams  (\u00a36.4m) and  James Ward-Prowse  (\u00a36.2m) could be good differentials. \n Lateriser ( @lateriser12 ) \n Manchester United  will be fairly popular in Gameweek 17. They have already played all of the top-six sides this season.  Diogo Dalot  (\u00a34.8m),  Luke Shaw  (\u00a34.7m),  Marcus Rashford  (\u00a36.7m) and  Anthony Martial  (\u00a36.7m) are players I will be looking at. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Southampton,  Newcastle United  and  Liverpool \u00a0have great matches\u00a0between Gameweeks 17 and 22, going by the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings , so I will be looking to target players from these teams. Players like  Callum Wilson  (\u00a37.5m) and  Allan Saint-Maximin  (\u00a36.2m) could be good picks. Southampton will also be interesting to watch for a new manager bounce.  \n I'll mostly have my eyes on Liverpool's  Luis Diaz  (\u00a37.8m) and  Diogo Jota  (\u00a38.8m), who are both due back from injury after the World Cup too. \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n It's been a painful few weeks not owning  Arsenal  midfielders  Bukayo Saka  (\u00a38.0m) and  Gabriel Martinelli  (\u00a36.8m), so they'll be key Gameweek 17 picks for me. I plan to triple up on Arsenal assets. They are one of the clubs with a match in hand this season. \n Nick ( @WGTA_Nick )\u00a0 \n Newcastle have been in excellent form this season and they have a great fixture run post-World Cup as well, so I will definitely keep their players in my team. Otherwise I'll be targeting Liverpool,  Manchester City  and also Southampton players. The likes of  Adams  and  Ward-Prowse  could be interesting differentials. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n Before even looking at individuals, I will be identifying teams I want to cover with Arsenal and Newcastle at the top of my list, alongside triple Man City of course.  \n Andy Park ( @FPL_Sonaldo ) \n It's hard to ignore  Darwin   Nunez  (\u00a38.9m) as an FPL asset when he's playing and in full flow. Although he seems to hit the crossbar as much as  Bryan Mbeumo  (\u00a35.8m), I feel his haul potential is there every time. I like the fact that as an FPL asset he keeps his head down and thinks of shooting first before passing. He could be a big differential come Gameweek 17. \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n Nunez ,  Saka  and  Wilson  are the three somewhat less popular picks that, at the moment, I definitely see myself owning come Gameweek 17. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 GW15 Lessons: Almiron a long-term buy in Fantasy \n GW16 deadline: 11:00 GMT, Sat 12 Nov \n",

        "text": "\n Here are some facts about transfers that help to explain how deals get done, why the transfer window exists and the processes that are required for deals. \n For more details download the\u00a0 Premier League Handbook  (PDF size: 16MB) \n Authorised signatory \u2013  Any player contract and transfer agreement must be signed by an authorised signatory of the club. This means an official of a club duly authorised by a resolution of its board of directors to sign forms as required by these rules. \n Board \u2013  All player registrations are subject to approval of the Premier League Board. \n Compensation fee \u2013  This is the sum of money agreed by two clubs for the transfer of the registration of a player and is generally made by telegraphic transfer. (see Rule V.26 of the Handbook) \n Deal sheets \u2013  Sometimes it is not easy for clubs to get everything on a deal completed and sent over to the Premier League by the deadline. The deal sheet allows a club to confirm that a deal has been reached and to allow for additional time to submit the remaining documentation. \n The sheet cannot be used until two hours before the deadline and needs to arrive fully completed before the transfer window closes. Once the sheet arrives, clubs have an additional two hours after the window closes to submit the full paperwork. But if a club are looking to complete an international transfer, they still have to comply with the FIFA TMS of deadline of midnight. \n Deadlines -  The Premier League summer 2022 transfer window closed at 23:00 BST on 1 September 2022. January 2023's winter transfer window opened on 1 January 2023 and closes at 23:00 GMT on 31 January 2023. \n EPFL transfer window countdown \u2013  the European Professional Football Leagues website provides a handy overview to the  deadline days of the transfer window across the Continent . \n Exceptional temporary transfer (aka emergency loan) \u2013  Under rule V.7.6.2 clubs the temporary transfer of a goalkeeper in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d, subject to Board permission, can take place outside the transfer window. \n Eligibility \u2013  Where applicable, a club\u2019s application to register a player has to be accompanied by evidence to allow the League to demonstrate that the player may take up employment in the UK. The League will not confirm the player is eligible to play for the club applying to register him until it has received such evidence. (Rule U.13) See also Permits (Work) and International transfer Certificate. \n Fax -  Documentation is no longer through fax machines, but by desktop faxes or scanned documents sent by email. \n Gross \u2013  The FA rules that all remuneration in contracts of players transferred be stated in gross (i.e. before PAYE and National Insurance deductions). \n Home grown players \u2013  A \"Home Grown Player\" (HGP) means a player who, irrespective of his nationality or age, has been registered with any club affiliated to The Football Association or the Football Association of Wales for a period, continuous or not, of three entire seasons or 36 months before his 21st birthday (or the end of the season during which he turns 21). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Conor Gallagher was one of the home grown players who moved to a PL club in the summer of 2021, joining Palace on loan\n             \n \n International Transfer Certificate \u2013  For any player registered outside The FA or the FAW and wanting to play in the Premier League, the FA or FAW must have issued to them an International Transfer Certificate from the national association he is leaving. \n Loans \u2013 \u00a0These are officially called temporary transfers. Under Premier League rules, there are restrictions on how many players Premier League clubs can loan from other Premier League/English clubs. They are: - Premier League clubs may not register more than two players on loan at any one time. - The maximum number of loans registrable in the same season is four, and, under no circumstances, shall more than one be from the same club at any one time. - Premier League clubs cannot loan to another Premier League club a player they have acquired in the same transfer window. - A Premier League club may loan not more than one of its goalkeepers to another Premier League club \n With the exception of Welsh clubs competing in the competitions listed under Rule V.6.2, loans from a club in membership of another National Association do not count towards the above quotas. \n Medical \u2013  All players transferred from one club to another have medical examinations to determine their fitness before a contract is signed. When clubs are negotiating a temporary transfer, the club looking to acquire the player can request the club where he is registered to provide his medical records. \n Net spend \u2013  the amount of money spent on transfers by clubs that includes spending of compensation fees received for players transferred. \n Out of contract -  If a player is out of contract prior to the close of the window he is free to approach and sign for a club outside the transfer window, but the club must gain the approval of the Premier League Board. \n Points-based-system -  Players with passports from outside the European Union and the European Economic Area need permission to work in the UK. The UK Home Office has a points-based system based on which clubs must apply to The FA for a \"Governing Body Endorsement\" for such players. (See p625 of the  Premier League Handbook ) \n If the player does not automatically meet these criteria, the club can request an FA Exceptions Panel consider the player\u2019s experience and value in order to determine whether a Governing Body Endorsement should nevertheless be granted. \n Registration -  To register a player, clubs have to send the Premier League all the documents relating to the transfer, including but not limited to the player\u2019s contract, the transfer agreement, permission to work in the UK (if required), international clearance if transferring from abroad International Transfer Certificate). For a player transferring from abroad, providing that the relevant papers have been submitted in time, ITC can be received up to 75 minutes before kick-off for a player to be eligible. \n Squad list \u2013  After the closure of the transfer window each Premier League club must submit a squad list containing no more than 17 players who do not fulfil the \"Home Grown Player\" (HGP) criteria. The remainder of the squad, up to a total of 25 players, must be home grown. Under-21 players are eligible over and above the limit of 25 players per squad. For the 2022/23 campaign Under-21 players will have been born on or after 1 January 2001. \n Third-party ownership -  The Premier League outlawed third-party ownership of players in 2007. The Premier League needs to be satisfied that any player joining one of its clubs has no third-party interests in his economic rights in order for him to be formally registered. \n Transfer Matching System -  When there is an international transfer, the buying and selling clubs have to register it on the FIFA Transfer Matching System (TMS) in order for international clearance to be generated. The buying club have to upload all the information to the system and the foreign club have to match all the details. The English FA will request clearance and as long everything matches; the foreign association will issue clearance to The FA, who then informs the club and League. The Premier League receives a copy because it needs to ensure that players coming in have had their registration transferred to this country, or Wales, in the case of Swansea City. \n UEFA \u2013  The deadline for registrations for UEFA competitions is 23:00 BST 1 September. \n V \u2013  Section V of the Premier League Handbook, consists of all the rules pertaining to the transfer of player registrations. \n Window \u2013  The transfer window as it exists started in 2002/03 and was introduced as part of a compromise agreement between FIFA and the European Commission about how the whole transfer system worked and how it could best preserve contractual stability for both the player and the club while allowing movement at prescribed times during the year \u2013 the summer and winter transfer windows in effect. \n X -  Xherdan Shaqiri was an example of where suspensions imposed by other national associations carry over into the association where the player will be registered. After being signed by Stoke City in summer 2015 Shaqiri was forced to miss the first match he was available for, away to Tottenham Hotspur, because of a one-match ban received in the Coppa Italia while at Inter Milan. \n Youth \u2013  scholars joining clubs are subject to the same transfer windows but not English scholars. \n Z -  Section Z of the rulebook covers the resolution of disputes over player contracts \n See:  January 2023 Transfers and News \n",

        "text": "\n The advent of the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar, starting on 20 November, brings a pause to the Premier League, and so to Fantasy Premier League, as well.\u00a0 \n However, FPL managers have the opportunity to take stock of their 2022/23 seasons so far and overhaul their teams. This is because they can make unlimited free transfers after the Gameweek 16 deadline at 13:30 GMT on 12 November and the return of the Premier League on Boxing Day, for Gameweek 17.\u00a0 \n Here is what managers need to know as they plan ahead. \n Will player prices rise and fall during the FIFA World Cup 2022?\u00a0 No, player prices will be frozen during the World Cup.  \n What is the date of last price changes? The last set of price changes will occur on 13 November as a result of transfers that occurred ahead of the GW16 deadline at 11:00 GMT on 12 November. Any transfers made after the deadline will not affect player prices.\u00a0 \n Player prices will be frozen from after the GW16 deadline until the GW17 deadline at 11:00 GMT on 26 December. Player prices will be \"unfrozen\" after the GW17 deadline. Any transfers made after the GW17 deadline will contribute to player price changes. \n Can I roll a free transfer from GW16? Yes, you can roll a free transfer in GW16 or GW17 and have two free transfers going into GW18. If you make two or more transfers in GW17 then you will lose your saved transfer. \n Are the number of transfers made between GW16 & GW17 added to our number of \"total transfers\"? Yes \n How does the total transfers impact my team?\u00a0 The total transfers made will impact your team in the event of a tie-breaker if you\u2019re level with another manager in a classic-scoring league at the end of the season. This doesn\u2019t impact head-to-head leagues or Cups. \n Will transfers made during the World Cup cost me any points? No, all transfers made after GW16 and ahead of the GW17 deadline will be free transfers and won\u2019t cost you any points. \n Is there a limit on the amount of transfers I can make during the World Cup? No. \n Can I play any chips in GW17? Yes, you can play your Bench Boost, Free Hit or Triple Captain if available. But, you won\u2019t be able to play your Wildcard. \n Can I roll my Wildcard into GW17 and have two Wildcards from GW17 onwards? No, if you still have an available Wildcard, you must play that ahead of GW16 deadline or you will lose it. \n Does the 50 per cent sell-on still exist? Will I have to pay the difference if I sell a player and then get him back in? The price shown on your transfers page is a player's selling price. This selling price may be less than the player's current purchase price as a sell-on fee of 50 per cent will be applied on any profits made on that player. This remains in effect for the World Cup period. For example, Erling Haaland\u2019s current cost is \u00a312.1m. If you owned him at his \u00a311.5m starting price and transferred him out, you\u2019d receive \u00a311.8m. However, if you then decided to bring him back, Haaland would cost you \u00a312.1m. \u00a0 \n",

They have each earned four yellow cards this season and would miss Gameweek 16 if they are booked this weekend. \n See:  Who is suspended or close to a ban? \n Notably, this has not deterred managers, with a combined 125,000 Toney owners moving for one of either Mitrovic, Jesus or Kane. \n Dominic Calvert-Lewin  (\u00a37.9m),  Dominic Solanke  (\u00a35.7m) and  Gianluca Scamacca  (\u00a36.7m) all look well-placed as differential Toney replacements, boasting favourable schedules for the next two Gameweeks. \n Fixtures for differential options \n \n \n \n Player \n GW15 \n GW16 \n \n \n \n \n Scamacca (WHU) \n CRY (H) \n LEI (H) \n \n \n Calvert-Lewin (EVE) \n LEI (H) \n BOU (A) \n \n \n Solanke (BOU) \n LEE (A) \n EVE (H) \n \n \n \n Finally,  Erling Haaland 's (\u00a312.2m) huge 80.3 per cent owners have been patient as they await news on his fitness after he missed out  against Leicester City  last weekend due to a foot injury. \n If fit, the Norwegian will be the overwhelming armband favourite for the next two Gameweeks as he  faces Fulham  and  Brentford  at home. \n Only 67,000 have decided to sell Haaland in the Gameweek, compared with the massive 585,000+ transfers out prompted by Toney's ban. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  Best FPL replacements for suspended Toney Part 3:  FPL experts: Wilson the go-to Toney replacement \n",

Points seem to be fairly spread out in that team which is why I'll be looking at value picks.  Ben White  (\u00a34.7m) has done well for me so far and is the best budget pick in that defence. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n I'm not that keen on Arsenal's fixtures so think just one or two players is sensible. Their attacking players all have similar potential so it makes sense to go for the cheaper  Gabriel Martinelli  (\u00a36.8m), and if you want a defender I'd opt for  White  as the cheapest option. Their centre-backs have had some attacking returns but are not reliable enough to be worth the extra money. \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n A triple-up from the current league leaders feels a must. In defence, White offers value, even though  Gabriel  (\u00a35.2m) stands out as the one with the highest potential for attacking returns. I will look to double up in attack by pairing  Martinelli  with either  Gabriel Jesus  or  Bukayo Saka  (both \u00a38.0m). The latter will depend on how far England get to in the FIFA World Cup. \n If tight for budget, then  Martin Odegaard  (\u00a36.4m), who is resting over the break due to Norway not qualifying for the FIFA World Cup 2022, could also be a shrewd pick. \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n As Arsenal top the league heading into Gameweek 17 it makes sense to invest heavily in their players, especially with a Double Gameweek 23 on the horizon. With four clean sheets in their last five matches, investing in two defenders could be the best way to double up.  White  offers great value for money alongside Gabriel or  William Saliba  (\u00a35.3m). \n The midfielder slot is more difficult as  Saka  and  Martinelli  look good, although both have progressed in the FIFA World Cup so will have longer away. If forced to choose between the two then Martinelli's price sways me towards him, especially as this allows for more premiums by saving budget. \n Geoff Dance\u00a0( @GeoffreyDance ) \n I am tipping the fit-again  Oleksandr Zinchenko  (\u00a35.0m) to re-establish himself as Arsenal's go-to defender in Fantasy. The Ukrainian's potential for returns at both ends of the pitch, as well as bonus points, makes him an appealing pick with just eight per cent ownership. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n The value in Arsenal lies in their defence and in midfield, with  White, Martinelli  and  Saka  the standouts. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Best Newcastle picks Part 3:  Best \u00a38.0m midfielders Part 4:  How many premiums should managers pick? Part 5:\u00a0 Players to start considering due to World Cup \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout\u2019s panel of  Fantasy Premier League  experts discuss the key dilemmas facing managers when building their Gameweek 17 squads with the unlimited free transfers.\u00a0 \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Newcastle United \u2019s first five fixtures after the FIFA World Cup 2022 include  Leicester City ,  Leeds United ,  Fulham  and  Crystal Palace . These are all matches in which I would expect them to score goals as well as keep some clean sheets. \n For me, with their form heading into the World Cup, as well as at their price points,  Kieran Trippier  (\u00a35.9m) and  Miguel Almiron  (\u00a35.8m) feel like must-owns. \n Callum Wilson  (\u00a37.4m) could be a great differential option, however, with fellow forwards  Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.2m) and  Harry Kane  (\u00a311.6m) being the top-scoring players in Fantasy. That only leaves space for one other forward and managers might prefer to invest in the likes of  Darwin Nunez  (\u00a39.0m). \n I think there is scope for a second defender in the likes of budget-friendly  Dan Burn  (\u00a34.5m) or midfielders such as  Bruno Guimaraes  (\u00a35.7m) or  Allan Saint-Maximin  (\u00a36.2m). \n Geoff Dance\u00a0( @GeoffreyDance ) \n Although both  Nick Pope  (\u00a35.3m) and Trippier are the top-scoring players in their positions, I am more inclined to pick  Sven Botman  (\u00a34.4m) over the goalkeeper if I double-up on Newcastle\u2019s defence. The Dutchman leads Pope by 38 points to 32 since securing a regular role in Gameweek 9 and his impact has reduced the 'keeper's many routes to returns recently. \n Pope produced eight save points and six bonus in the first eight Gameweeks but has managed only two save points and zero bonus since. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Apart from the  trip to Arsenal in Gameweek 19 , Newcastle's fixtures suggest their star men will prove to be a decent investment.  Trippier  will certainly be in a lot of squads, even if England go deep into the World Cup. \n I'll also look for attacking coverage and with Paraguay not being in Qatar, I'm backing  Almiron  to pick up where he left off in November. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n Newcastle's fixtures and player prices suggest that owning at least two options, if not three, is the best tactic.  Trippier  is a must-have. \n After him I'd prioritise  Wilson \u00a0and then  Pope . Almiron is a great price and in unbelievable form but I wouldn't be surprised to see a run of blanks for him as a marked man. \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n We need to remove past biases from Newcastle and look at them as a top-six, or even a top-four team. They have shown great form at both ends of the pitch and therefore owning a defender and an attacker feels necessary. Trippier is the highest-scoring defender and he should continue where he left off.  Botman \u00a0also offers superb value. \n Up front, a fit Wilson is hard to ignore, but if you are only looking for one attacker, I'd favour  Almiron  as the cheaper alternative. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  Best Arsenal picks Part 3:  Best \u00a38.0m midfielders Part 4:  How many premiums should managers pick?

        "text": "\n It is 30 years to the day since  Eric Cantona  joined  Manchester United , going on to play a starring role in four titles across the Premier League's first five seasons. \n But that was not the transfer that Bill Fotherby, managing director of reigning champions  Leeds United , had in mind when he made a phone call to Man Utd chairman Martin Edwards in November 1992. \n In fact, he was enquiring about signing Red Devils defender  Denis Irwin , as he revealed when telling the tale of Cantona's time at Leeds and move to Man Utd, before Fotherby passed away in 2019. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n \"We had got Eric on a recommendation from Michel Platini, who told (our manager)  Howard Wilkinson  he could be very difficult to handle but had the potential to be a great player,\" recalled Fotherby. \n \"At the time, we didn't have any money. People thought we had won the pools but we were actually potless. Because of that, when we met his advisors to put together a deal we agreed to pay Eric something like \u00a3500,000 if we kept him after an initial period of a few months. \n \"It was an immense amount of money for Leeds - not money we had at any rate - but we agreed to it because we had this recommendation from Platini and we judged the most important thing was to get the player, and deal with the rest afterwards.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Leeds won the 1991/92 league title with Cantona in the side\n             \n \n There were difficulties almost immediately. \"Apart from  Lee Chapman , no one in the squad spoke fluent French and for Howard it was a bit of a nightmare,\" Fotherby went on. \"Although we won the title, there was just no connection between them. \n \"We had a disaster against Rangers in the European Cup and were coming up to the point where this additional \u00a3500,000 had to be paid. Howard told me to find Eric another club.\" \n Fotherby had not yet acted on that request when full-back  Mel Sterland  got injured. \n \"I rang United about Denis Irwin, who had been at Leeds as a young boy,\" said Fotherby. \"Martin Edwards said there was no chance, but I asked him to at least speak to (Man Utd manager)  Alex Ferguson . \n \n \n \"Sometimes people just move to a certain club at a certain time and become something they would never have been anywhere else.\" \n \n Bill Fotherby on Eric Cantona \n \n \n \n \"Normally, I wouldn't have expected him to ring back. This time he did, offering me a different player I knew Howard would not be interested in. It was then he asked about Eric. \n \u201cI said absolutely no way and that it was impossible. But obviously I knew what Howard felt about him, and I knew this additional payment was due. \n \"As I had done before, Martin asked if I would talk to Howard. On that particular day Howard was out house-hunting in Leeds, so the only person I actually spoke to was (coach) Mick Hennigan. I just said, 'I can't believe it. Guess what has come right out of the blue. Howard will absolutely love it.' \n \"I left it a couple of hours, rang Martin back and said, 'I can't believe this but Howard is willing to let the boy go'.\" \n And so the deal was rushed through, for a fee thought to be around \u00a31million. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n \"Our fans were bothered,\" said Fotherby. \"They were really bothered. But I would have done exactly the same again. \n \"Eric was absolutely magnificent for them but it was not all one way. We got something similar when  Gordon Strachan  came to us and took us from Division Two to champions. Before that, Johnny Giles came from Manchester United and look what he did for Leeds. It happens. \n \"Sometimes people just move to a certain club at a certain time and become something they would never have been anywhere else. The fact it was Manchester United gave it an edge I suppose but they were the ones who made the offer for a player our manager did not want. \n \"Howard was an absolute perfectionist. He wanted his players to be disciplined and adhere to a certain team pattern. Eric just didn't fit it. \n \"Alex Ferguson gave him a free role and probably wasn't quite as strict with Eric as Howard would have been. Eric liked to play to the crowd. That wasn't Howard's way at all.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n While Cantona went on to secure legendary status among Man Utd fans, Leeds never reached the heights of the 1991/92 season again. \n Indeed, a  4-0 defeat by the Red Devils \u00a0at Elland Road in September 1996, in which Cantona scored a last-minute goal, marked the end of Wilkinson's time at the club. \n Nonetheless, Fotherby refused to criticise Wilkinson for his part in the transfer. \n \"It was not a question of blaming Howard,\" he said. \"I believed in him and wouldn't hear a bad word against him. He was Leeds' best manager since Don Revie. \n \"He brought in Gordon Strachan,  Gary McAllister  and  Tony Yeboah . He won us the league. And all the time we were doing it on a shoestring, asking sponsors to chip in here and there to make up the bits we didn't have. For eight years, it worked.\" \n See: Season reviews and records from the first 30 Premier League seasons \n",

        "summary": "One of the world's top Fantasy managers explains how he is using his unlimited free transfers",
        "text": "\n With the season paused for the FIFA World Cup 2022,  Fantasy Premier League  experts have been tinkering with their squads. \n FPL managers can make  unlimited transfers  until the action resumes on 26 December. \n Andy Park, also known as  FPL_Sonaldo , talks us through his new squad for Gameweek 17. \n Goalkeepers \n Danny Ward  (\u00a34.1m): At his price,  Leicester City 's keeper is too enticing to give up. \n Daniel Iversen  (\u00a33.9m): When selecting a set-and-forget option, I like to choose my main goalkeeper's back-up. \n Defenders \n Kieran Trippier  (\u00a35.9m):  Newcastle United  have proven to be an unbelievable team this season. They're an elite defensive side and equally good going forward. \n Joao Cancelo  (\u00a37.4m); This is just a no-brainer pick.  Manchester City  look to have the potential for a lot of clean sheets after the World Cup and he offers some attacking threat. \n Andrew Robertson  (\u00a36.8m): This is a player I am excited to own.  Liverpool 's fixtures are very good for the next seven or eight Gameweeks, and the Scot has great potential with his attacking threat. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Ben White  (\u00a34.7m): A great-value pick. Fantasy managers want a piece of  Arsenal 's defence, who have been extremely good this season. White also has some good attacking potential, despite his budget-enabling price point. \n Neco Williams  (\u00a34.0m): For my fifth-defender slot, I like to have a player I am happy to bench. While  Nottingham Forest \u00a0haven\u2019t kept many clean sheets, Williams has great attacking potential. \n Midfielders\u00a0 \n Mohamed Salah  (\u00a312.8m): He should be in all unlimited transfer squads. The Egyptian has been resting during this period, meaning he will be fresh when the season resumes. \n Gabriel Martinelli  (\u00a36.8m): At this price point, he is probably the best-value player in Fantasy. \n Miguel Almiron\u00a0 (\u00a35.8m): He is extremely budget-friendly. He is one of the highest-scoring players this season and he's going to continue that form after the World Cup. \n Marcus Rashford  (\u00a36.7m):  Manchester United  have three amazing fixtures between Gameweeks 17 and 19. They host Forest and  AFC Bournemouth  either side of a trip to  Wolverhampton Wanderers .\u00a0While United have provided a mixed bag in terms of FPL returns this season, I think it's wise to invest in Rashford. \n Andreas Pereira  (\u00a34.6m): The  Fulham  player will continue to be my fifth midfield option and is a solid option for his price this season. You can't rely on him every Gameweek, but this is fine for a player who will often be benched. \n Make changes to your own FPL squad now \n Forwards \n Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.2m): He is going to be the perma-captain for FPL managers in most Gameweeks. \n Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a38.0m): Partnering Haaland in my attack, Jesus is just one of those players with extremely high Expected Goal Involvement (xGI) and he's very involved in most matches. \n Darwin Nunez  (\u00a39.0m): The Uruguayan is second in terms of Expected Goals (xG) after Haaland. He is one of those exciting picks that you really want in your team no matter who he's playing. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Nick Harris' GW17 squad Part 3:  Gianni Buttice's GW17 squad Part 4:  Pras' GW17 squad Part 5:  Sam Bonfield's GW17 squad \n",

They then face Man City again in the FA Cup at the weekend before playing their second match of the Double Gameweek on the following Thursday at Craven Cottage. This adds additional risk of rotation and injury to FPL managers looking to invest in the Blues. \n The same also applies to the key Fulham players, who have a cup tie against Hull City ahead of their second match in Double Gameweek 19. \u00a0\u00a0 \n Doubles for Man City\u00a0 \n Managers should also be aware of the fixture congestion facing Man City. \n The rearranged fixture for Pep Guardiola's side against Spurs in Double Gameweek 20 means they will potentially play twice a week throughout January, if they progress in both the EFL Cup and FA Cup. \n See:\u00a0 Two possible Double Gameweeks for Man City \n Indeed, if Man City continue to stay in both competitions, they will play twice a week until March. \n If Man City or Spurs need an FA Cup third round replay, their Double Gameweek 20 fixture will be postponed. This means both teams would revert to having a Single Gameweek. Managers will need to be aware of both sides' results in the FA Cup before investing for the possible Double Gameweek. \n Potential pitfalls \n When Fantasy managers are selecting players using their unlimited free transfers, it will be important to try and invest in those who will benefit from Double Gameweeks in January. \n But these clubs, such as Man City, could potentially have as many as nine matches in January. Teams like  Aston Villa  and  West Ham United  have kind fixtures. However, they may only play five times. \n",

He has made 28 saves so far, more than any other Premier League shot-stopper. \n Joao Cancelo (MCI) \u00a37.1m \n Cancelo has received more passes in the final third than any other defender in the game this season. Only Kevin De Bruyne (\u00a312.2m) and Phil Foden (\u00a38.0m) have supplied more crosses this season for  Man City , so more attacking returns look likely.\u00a0 \n Kieran Trippier (NEW) \u00a35.3m \n Trippier is the most transferred-in player ahead of the Gameweek 8 deadline. He has had over 167,000 transfers in so far. He has also taken more free-kicks and corners than any other defender, increasing his potential route to points.\u00a0 \n Emerson Royal (TOT) \u00a35.1m \n Royal has played 90 minutes for  Spurs  in each of their last four Premier League matches.  Spurs play Leicester City  in Gameweek 8 and they have the third-lowest expected goals (xG) tally in the league.\u00a0 \n Gabriel Martinelli (ARS) \u00a36.5m \n Martinelli has returned in four of  Arsenal \u2019s opening fixtures of the season. He is first for threat in the ICT index amongst midfielders in the game.\u00a0 \n James Ward-Prowse (SOU) \u00a36.5m \n Ward-Prowse  faces Aston Villa  in Gameweek 8. Villa have conceded 27 attempts from set-pieces so far this season; only five teams have conceded more. Ward-Prowse takes all of Southampton\u2019s set-pieces and so could thrive in Gameweek 8.\u00a0 \n Kevin De Bruyne (MCI) \u00a312.2m \n With no fixture for Mohamed Salah (\u00a312.9m) there is a good opportunity for managers playing the Free Hit chip to own players like De Bruyne. The City midfielder has created 20 chances for his team-mates so far this season, and only Erling Haaland (\u00a312.0m) has had more attempts on goal in the Man City squad.\u00a0 \n Andreas Pereira (FUL) \u00a34.6m \n Owned by 27 per cent of managers, Pereira often finds himself on FPL managers' benches. However,  Pereira visits Nottingham Forest , who have conceded 14 goals this season. Only Leicester and  AFC Bournemouth  have let in more.\u00a0 \n Erling Haaland (MCI) \u00a312.0m \n Haaland has returned in every Premier League game he has played in so far this season.

He is averaging a goal every 74 minutes in his debut Fantasy campaign.\u00a0 \n Julian Alvarez (MCI) \u00a36.1m \n Another Man City attacker whose domestic minutes have improved recently, Alvarez has had a run of four straight starts. At a cost of just \u00a36.0m, he could be a budget gem if Guardiola continues to rotate his regulars. \n",

Manchester City  rotation has been rife in recent matches and I think  De Bruyne  is unlikely to start both matches in DGW37. \n Pras ( @Pras_FPL ) \n I don't see the upside of selling  Salah , especially for  De Bruyne , \u00a0 who may have the title wrapped up after his first match of DGW37 against  Chelsea  - or even before that, depending on  Arsenal 's result against  Nottingham Forest .  Fernandes,  however, has something to play for and is on penalty duties. \n Geoffrey Dance ( @GeoffreyDance ) \n Most managers would run the other way from selling  Salah , especially given his current form. While managers should try to make their transfers without losing the Egyptian, if owning  De Bruyne  or  Fernandes  could help them improve their mini-league positions - because those they are up against don't own them - it could be worth considering.\u00a0 \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Salah 's home form has been sensational of late. He hasn't blanked at Anfield since GW21 and, with Liverpool on a seven-match winning streak, I wouldn't sell him.  Fernandes  and  De Bruyne  are great players to own, but I'd have them alongside Salah, rather than instead of him. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n Liverpool are on fire and  Salah  has blanked only once over their last eight matches. He could match or outscore  De Bruyne  or  Fernandes , especially when the Gameweek 38 fixture  at Southampton  is factored in. \n DGW37 deadline: 11:00 BST, Sat 20 May \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  FPL experts: Best players to target for Double Gameweek 37 Part 2:  The Scout's best Man Utd picks for Double Gameweek 37 Part 4:  The Scout's best Chelsea picks for Double Gameweek 37 Part 5:\u00a0 The Scout's best Man City picks for Double Gameweek 37 Part 6:  FPL experts: Who to target for Man City's Double Gameweek \n",

        "text": "\n With player prices in Fantasy Premier League susceptible to price changes on a daily basis, here is an explanation of how and why this occurs. \n Why prices change \n Player prices may change when they are heavily transferred in or out by FPL managers. A player's price can rise by \u00a30.1m per day if they are a popular transfer in. However, if a player is heavily sold by FPL managers, their price can drop by \u00a30.1m per day. \n The change in a player's price will reflect their activity in the transfer market. \n When prices change \n Player price changes happen overnight UK time. \n Impact of price changes \n When a player has a price change, it can have an impact on FPL managers. \n Managers can find themselves priced out of buying a player that they want. This can be because one of their players has decreased by \u00a30.1m or the player that they have been targeting, has risen by \u00a30.1m. \n Over the course of the season, FPL managers try to grow their team value by investing in the players, who are the most popular transfers in. This means that their team would be worth more than the \u00a3100m given to FPL managers in pre-season. \n However, the transfer market can also mean that manager' team value can slip under \u00a3100m, if their players are heavily transferred out. \n Monitor transfers in and out \n Managers should monitor the  transfers in and out  of players over the course of the season. This will allow managers to see who the most popular transfers in are; the players likely to rise in price, as well as the most heavily-sold players, who are likely to fall in price. \n Prices shown on the transfer page are players' selling prices minus any sell-on fee. To check the price you paid for a player, please use the list view on the transfers page. \n The selling price for a player may be less than the current price at which FPL managers can buy the player. \n This is a sell-on fee of 50 per cent (rounded up to the nearest \u00a30.1m), will be applied on any profits made on that player. For example, if FPL managers buy a player for \u00a35.5m and sell him when his price is \u00a35.9m, the selling price will be \u00a35.7m. \n See:\u00a0 Fantasy Premier League stats \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout assesses the top-scoring players in the opening 16 Gameweeks of  Fantasy Premier League . \n Nick Pope (NEW) \u00a35.3m, 70pts \n His multiple routes to returns have helped  Newcastle United 's No 1 to the top of the goalkeeper standings. Pope has combined seven clean sheets with 10 save points and six bonus points in his 15 appearances. \n Kieran Trippier (NEW) \u00a35.9m, 96pts \n The right-back has been among the most consistent players this term, blanking in only three of his 15 outings. Trippier produced one goal, four assists, nine clean sheets and 17 bonus and holds a 22-point lead as the top-scoring defender in Fantasy. \n William Saliba (ARS) \u00a35.3m, 74pts \n Arsenal 's Frenchman has proven a huge source of value after starting 2022/23 at a cost of just \u00a34.5m. Saliba has thrived on the road in particular; indeed he is the top-scoring player away from home, amassing 58 points on his travels.\u00a0 \n Gabriel (ARS) \u00a35.2m, 72pts \n The Brazilian sits just two points behind Saliba thanks to two goals, seven clean sheets and nine bonus. Gabriel scored five goals last term and has been the Gunners' main threat at the back, producing nine shots in the box compared with the three of Saliba. \n Miguel Almiron (NEW) \u00a35.8m, 93pts \n Eight goals and two assists have taken the Paraguayan to the top of the midfield standings, earning him a \u00a30.8m rise in price since the season started. Almiron is second only to team-mate Trippier for value in Fantasy, returning 16.0 points per million spent. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Kevin De Bruyne (MCI) \u00a312.6m, 90pts \n The  Manchester City  playmaker's 10 assists have surpassed his total of eight from 2021/22 Fantasy. De Bruyne's 45 key passes and 15 big chances created are both more than any other player in Fantasy in the first 16 Gameweeks.\u00a0 \n Mohamed Salah (LIV) \u00a312.8m, 82pts \n Liverpool 's Egyptian is the second most-sold player this season, moved on by over 5.1 million managers after scoring only six goals. Yet Salah has been the standout threat among all midfielders,\u00a0his 50 shots, 39 shots in the box and 14 big chances all ranking top in his position. \n Leandro Trossard (BHA) \u00a37.1m, 80pts \n A role up front for  Brighton & Hove Albion  under new head coach Roberto De Zerbi has lifted the Belgian's potential. Trossard's 20 shots in the box and seven big chances both rank second among midfielders since the Italian's arrival. \n Erling Haaland (MCI) \u00a312.2m, 123pts \n Man City's Norwegian has taken Fantasy by storm in his debut campaign, scoring 18 goals and supplying three assists in only 13 appearances. Owned by a massive 82 per cent, Haaland has averaged 9.8 points per start to establish himself as the go-to captain for millions of managers each Gameweek.\u00a0 \n Harry Kane (TOT) \u00a311.6m, 102pts \n Tottenham Hotspur 's talisman has proven the best premium-priced partner for Haaland in managers' squads, thanks to his all-round style of play. Kane's 12 goals and three assists have helped him collect 21 bonus points, more than any other player. \n Ivan Toney (BRE) \u00a37.4m, 83pts \n Managers have flocked to the  Brentford  forward after his  two goals against Man City \u00a0last weekend. Toney is the top target in the unlimited free transfers period, earning 351,000+ new owners. \n",

        "text": "\n The \"Free Hit\" chip sits alongside the Wildcard, the Triple Captain and Bench Boost in  Fantasy Premier League . \n A Free Hit allows for unlimited transfers in a single Gameweek.\u00a0It can usually only be taken once a season.\u00a0 \n By playing the Free Hit chip, managers can replace their entire squad for that Gameweek BUT their 15-man line-up is returned to how it was at the start of the Gameweek for the next deadline. \n Saved transfers will be lost\u00a0 \n If the Free Hit chip is played leading up to Gameweek 32, for example, once the deadline has passed you will see the points scored by your new Free Hit squad in the \"Points\" tab. \n But in your \"My Team\" and \"Transfers\" tabs, your old Gameweek 31 squad will have returned.\u00a0 \n Like the Wildcard, the Free Hit is used when confirming transfers. It cannot be cancelled once confirmed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n No extra transfers \n Be aware that when playing your Free Hit chip, any free transfers carried over from previous Gameweeks will be lost. You will be back to the usual one free transfer for the following Gameweek. \n Also, if you use your free transfer and then subsequently decide to play the Free Hit chip, you will lose the initial signing you made. \n On the flip side, managers who take points hits and then regret the decision can use the Free Hit to cancel those deductions. \n No gains from price changes \n Managers cannot benefit from any price changes gained from their new Free Hit squad. \n However, price changes applied to their previous line-up will take effect on their return once the chip expires. \n So if a player has suffered a price drop while your Free Hit chip was active, you will have lost value on that player.\u00a0 \n When to play the Free Hit? \n While the Free Hit cannot be used to play the market, it is nonetheless a powerful strategy. \n It offers an alternative to the Wildcard as a way of temporarily fixing a squad. \n FPL managers can turn to the Free Hit when injuries and suspensions hit, or when\u00a0postponed fixtures cause issues. \n The Free Hit chip lets managers pick players who are not only in action but also have good fixtures. \n Double Gameweek rethink? \n It also allows managers to rethink their approach to Double Gameweeks, where teams have more than one fixture in a single Gameweek. \n These nearly always take place in the second half of the season and have always proved popular windows in which to put chips in play. \n The Free Hit can be used to maximise the number of players in a squad who will play twice. \n That can lead to many FPL managers rethinking their use of existing chips, particularly the second Wildcard. \n Use to target differentials \n One of the most powerful aspects of the Free Hit chip is the ability to take advantage of differentials.\u00a0 \n Normally, when using their free transfers, managers buy players who can deliver returns over a number of Gameweeks. \n But the Free Hit chip allows them to focus on short-term gains, targeting\u00a0players with the potential for big points in that specific Gameweek. \n Finding these one-off differentials could be key for a manager looking to gain an advantage\u00a0over mini-league rivals. \n",

It has been disappointing that  Mitoma  hasn't been on the scoresheet recently, but I am still keeping the faith. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n As good as the replacements have been for Brighton in recent weeks, I think it's pretty clear that Roberto De Zerbi still knows his core players, and nine or 10 of the starting XI pick themselves.  If you're invested in the likes of\u00a0 Mitoma ,  Mac Allister  and  March , you hold. \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Brighton looked tired in Gameweek 33. They have played a lot of matches, with their run in the FA Cup seemingly taking its toll in the league.  \n The rotation in their first match of Gameweek 34 gave key men a break, meaning they will now be fresher heading into the final weeks of the season. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:\u00a0 FPL experts: How to plan for Newcastle's Double Gameweek 36 \n",

This season Saka has returned 111 points, with 35 of those coming since the restart. Returns in four of the last six means he is the standout Arsenal pick as well as a genuine alternative to the  Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.2m) captaincy. \n \n \n \n \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 1 \n \n BRE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 3 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n I also really like  Gabriel  (\u00a35.2m) for DGW23. He has the best attacking numbers from Arsenal's defence. While a clean sheet doesn't necessarily look likely against  Manchester City , Gabriel's potential for points at both ends of the pitch makes him a great pick. \n Pras ( @Pras_FPL ) \n Saka  remains my top pick because he's likely on penalties and very involved in everything. Two home matches means Arsenal should come back strong following their  1-0 defeat at Everton .\u00a0 \n Martin\u00a0Odegaard  (\u00a37.0m) is one of those players you keep faith with long term as minutes and points will come.

For as long as  Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a37.9m) is out, I want Nketiah in my team. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Nketiah  has done a great job deputising for Jesus - his attacking stats before the Everton match were top across most metrics. Elsewhere, with penalty duties in his locker, I'd go for \u00a0Saka . \n I'm struggling to fit him at his price point in my team, so I'm likely to go without - he'll be a big concern for me if I go into the DGW23 without Arsenal's main man.\u00a0 \n Lateriser ( @lateriser12 ) \n From the Arsenal defence, I quite like  Gabriel  as a pick as he has a substantial set-piece threat in addition to clean-sheet potential. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @Zophar666 ) \n Odegaard  offers a combination of goal and assist threat, and is great for bonus points as well. He is the best Arsenal pick for DGW23. \n I also like  Nketiah , who has been getting all the big chances for Arsenal.

He's in form, playing for a form team and has a point to prove ahead of the FIFA World Cup. He's the obvious replacement for Toney for me. \n I also own  Aleksandar Mitrovic  (\u00a36.9m) and Haaland. Given the money I have in Haaland he will be a hold; I plan on benching Mitrovic as it stands but this is reliant on the Manchester City forward being fit. \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n We are so close to the unlimited transfers that I think it is worth the risk to go for players like  Mitrovic ,  Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a38.0m) or  Harry Kane  (\u00a311.6m), who are all on four yellow cards. \n After all, it's a risk for one Gameweek only because if they get that yellow in Gameweek 16, then you can take them out using unlimited transfers anyway. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n I'll be avoiding any forward on four yellows this week especially if part of the appeal is their Gameweek 16 fixture. There's other options that don't carry this risk such as  Wilson  or playing five in midfield. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n Wilson  really wants to get into Gareth Southgate's England squad and Newcastle United are one of the league's most attacking sides, so he would be the obvious pick with Kane, Jesus and Mitrovic on four yellow cards. \n Lateriser ( @lateriser12 ) \n Since we only have two Gameweeks until we have unlimited transfers, I wouldn't worry too much about the likes of  Kane  and  Jesus  being on four yellows as even one game is 50 per cent of the remainder of the season as we know it. \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n I own both Kane and Jesus. Both being on four yellows is frustrating as it means that I could have an issue for Gameweek 16. If either of them does pick up a yellow I'll go for  Wilson . He looked like the perfect pick heading into Gameweek 14 and his return has solidified that feeling. \n Paul Gee\u00a0( @FPLPaulGee ) \n Toney is a must-sell and if I owned him the best replacement in the same price bracket is  Wilson . I wouldn't worry about any of the players on four yellows as we are so close to unlimited transfers. \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n With exact funds, I've already made the move from Toney to  Wilson  before he went up in price. Newcastle are in fantastic form and I'm now tripled up on their assets. \n GW15 deadline: 13:30 GMT Saturday 5 November \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 GW14 Lessons: All change up front Part 2:  Best FPL replacements for suspended Toney \n",

He has started 13 of his side's 14 matches, while Foden has appeared off the bench in three of their last four. \n The Man City playmaker sits just three points off the top of the midfield standings on 90 points and has been involved in 13 goals, more than any other player in his position.\u00a0 \n De Bruyne has already amassed 10 assists, more than his total of eight from last term. \n And with Haaland leading the line, FPL managers could be richly rewarded for doubling up on Pep Guardiola's favoured big-hitters. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Double up with Ward and Iversen Part 2:  Dalot heads value budget defenders Part 3:  In-form Robertson back to his best Part 4:  Rodrigo rivalling Haaland for goals Part 6:  Ings can continue to deliver for Emery Part 7:  Darwin can evolve for successful season \n \u00a0 \n",

But Salah popped up with a header with nine minutes remaining, and received a bonus point to return eight points. \n There were mixed feelings for the 1.9m managers who captained Erling Haaland (\u00a311.7m), as the  Manchester City  striker scored his third goal of the season against  Newcastle United  on Sunday.\u00a0 \n Though Haaland was on target, he might have had a hat-trick but for the excellence of goalkeeper Nick Pope (\u00a35.0m) and a snatched chance from close range in the  3-3 thriller at St James' Park . \n Pope thwarted the Norwegian in the first half and turned another effort against the post in the second before Haaland blazed over late on. \n The result was six points for Haaland, which was at least two more than Gabriel Jesus (\u00a38.1m), who was the second-most captained player after Salah. \n The 2.3m managers who made the  Arsenal  forward their captain were left disappointed as he was limited to four points in  the Gunners' 3-0 win at AFC Bournemouth .\u00a0 \n Jesus bagged a 19-point haul in Gameweek 2 but could only manage an assist against the Cherries, while he also picked up a yellow card.\u00a0 \n The Brazilian was captained by just 45,000 fewer managers than Salah. \n GW3 most-captained players \n \n \n \n Player \n Captained by (000's) \n Pts \n \n \n \n \n Salah \n 2,432 \n 8 \n \n \n Jesus \n 2,386 \n 4 \n \n \n Haaland \n 1,938 \n 6 \n \n \n \n GW3 most transferred-in players \n \n \n \n Player \n Transferred in by ('000s) \n Pts \n \n \n \n \n Martinelli \n 1,287 \n 6 \n \n \n Rodrigo \n 994 \n 13 \n \n \n Jesus \n 922 \n 4 \n \n \n \n Gabriel Martinelli (\u00a36.3m) and Jesus both featured among the top three transfers in, thanks to their good form and appealing run of fixtures. Four of their next five matches are rated at just two in the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR). \n Snapped up by more than 922,000 managers, Jesus was owned by a record 7.5m managers at the Gameweek 3 deadline, taking his ownership to a staggering 80.4 per cent. \n But it was backers of Rodrigo (\u00a36.2m), the second-most recruited player ahead of Gameweek 3, who were happiest on Sunday.\u00a0 \n The  Leeds United  midfielder, playing out of position as a forward in the absence of the injured Patrick Bamford (\u00a37.4m), scored his fourth goal of the season, produced an assist and received two bonus in the  3-0 win over Chelsea  for a 13-point haul. \n He remains top of the Fantasy player standings on 35 points, 10 clear of Jesus.

That haul helped him become the first player to surpass the 200-point mark in six successive seasons.\u00a0 \n Fortune favours the brave \n Salah could prove a canny differential captain in the race for managers to be crowned Fantasy Premier League champion. \n Indeed,  Nori Pro  was one of just two people brave enough to go against Haaland among the top 100 managers, moving up over 20 places thanks to double points from captain Salah. \n The other manager who went against the grain was  Michael Gaber , ranked 36th overall heading into this round of fixtures.

With a Double Gameweek to follow in the next round, more than 330,000 Fantasy bosses snapped up the Newcastle forward. But he blanked against Arsenal. \n Pervis Estupinan  (\u00a34.9m) amassed 16 points across his two outings in Double Gameweek 34, the most of any defender, prompting 293,000+ to recruit him. \n However, the wing-back returned zero points against Everton on Monday, playing the full 90 minutes but being penalised for conceding five goals.\u00a0 \n The most-selected midfielder in Fantasy, found in more than 45 per cent of teams,  Marcus Rashford  (\u00a37.2m) has been bought by 1.6million people over the past three Gameweeks. \n But he blanked for the second match in a row in  Manchester United's 1-0 defeat at West Ham United . \n GW35 most transferred-out players \n \n \n \n Player \n Transferred out by ('000s) \n Pts \n \n \n \n \n De Bruyne \n 301 \n 3 \n \n \n Diogo Jota \n 242 \n 2 \n \n \n Toney \n 238 \n 2 \n \n \n \n There was relief among those who ditched the three most-sold players as they all blanked.\u00a0 \n More than 301,000 parted company with  Kevin De Bruyne  (\u00a312.2m), who recovered from injury to start versus Leeds.

Odegaard  visits Everton  with six double-figure scores to his name in 2022/23, second only to the seven of Erling Haaland (\u00a312.2m). \n Kaoru Mitoma (BHA) \u00a35.1m Brighton & Hove Albion 's Japanese star  hosts AFC Bournemouth  in a prolific run of form. Mitoma has four goals and two assists in his last six in all competitions, claiming his season-high 10 points in the  2-2 draw at\u00a0Leicester City  last time out. \n Erling Haaland (MCI) \u00a312.2m Manchester City 's forward has averaged 8.9 points per match on his way to the top of the player standings. Haaland has scored a league-high seven goals since the season resumed, including a strike in the  4-2 win against\u00a0Tottenham Hotspur  in Gameweek 20 ahead of Sunday's reverse fixture. \n Ivan Toney (BRE) \u00a37.7m The Brentford talisman has amassed 40 points across his previous five appearances, scoring five goals and supplying an assist. Toney can deliver another big score against a  Southampton  side who have kept only one single clean sheet on their travels. \n Wilfried Gnonto (LEE) \u00a35.0m\u00a0 His 11 shots, eight shots in the box and five chances created all place among Leeds' top three players from Gameweek 17 onwards. Gnonto has three goals in his last five matches across all competitions and could be a vital figure in the absence of the injured  Rodrigo  (\u00a36.4m). \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  GW22 Captains: Rashford can deliver as Triple Captain Part 3:  Should you Triple Captain Rashford in DGW22? \n",

        "text": "\n A Double Gameweek 19 for  Fulham  has made  Aleksandar Mitrovic  (\u00a37.1m) a huge target for managers in  Fantasy Premier League  ahead of  Monday's 16:00 GMT deadline . \n The Serb is the most-bought player in both Gameweek 18 and 19, collecting over one million new owners in that period. \n \n \n \n \n \n LEI \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 1 \n \n FUL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n FUL \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 1 \n \n CHE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Mitrovic can now be found in over 28 per cent of squads for the Cottagers\u2019 encounters with  Leicester City  and  Chelsea . \n He is among five players with two matches selected in a best XI that lines up in a 3-4-3 formation. The  Fulham  forward is handed the armband, with  Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.2m) named as vice-captain. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Bernd Leno (FUL) \u00a34.5m \n Fulham\u2019s goalkeeper offers many routes to returns for his DGW19. Leno has three clean sheets, seven save points and eight bonus points in his last seven outings. \n Trent Alexander-Arnold (LIV) \u00a37.2m \n Liverpool\u2019s right-back  visits Brentford  on the back of his best score since Gameweek 4. Alexander-Arnold was his side\u2019s top performer in Fantasy  in the 2-1 win over Leicester City  in the previous Gameweek, supplying an assist and maximum bonus to collect eight points.\u00a0 \n Marc Cucurella (CHE) \u00a35.2m \n The wing-back can deliver points at both ends of the pitch across Chelsea\u2019s two matches  against Manchester City  and Fulham. Cucurella is the second most-bought defender in the Gameweek, earning over 70,000 transfers in.\u00a0 \n Luke Shaw (MUN) \u00a34.9m \n The  Manchester United  defender has blanked just once in his last eight matches ahead of a  home meeting with AFC Bournemouth . Shaw combined two assists with five clean sheets and seven bonus points in that run.\u00a0 \n Mohamed Salah (LIV) \u00a312.9m \n The Egyptian has delivered double-figure returns in each of his last two road trips. Salah amassed 27 points in matches against\u00a0 Tottenham Hotspur  and  Aston Villa , scoring three goals and supplying an assist.\u00a0 \n Mason Mount (CHE) \u00a37.6m \n The midfielder is the only player to start all 10 of Graham Potter's matches in charge of Chelsea, suggesting he is unlikely to be rotated for their DGW19. Mount has delivered all three of his double-figure returns this season over those contests.\u00a0 \n Marcus Rashford (MUN) \u00a36.9m \n The Man Utd star has three double-figure scores in his six starts at Old Trafford in 2022/23 Fantasy, including a 14-point haul in his last home outing. Rashford can take advantage of an AFC Bournemouth side who have conceded at least twice in seven of their eight away matches. \n Andreas Pereira (FUL) \u00a34.6m \n A cost of just \u00a34.6m makes the playmaker a standout source of value for Fulham's two matches. Andreas has created 41 chances this season, more than twice the total of any team-mate. \n Erling Haaland (MCI) \u00a312.2m \n Manchester City \u2019s striker averages 8.2 points per start on his travels this term. Despite playing only one match, away to Chelsea, Haaland\u2019s huge 84 per cent ownership means he is very likely to remain the top captaincy pick. \n Harry Kane (TOT) \u00a311.6m \n The Spurs star has a prolific record  against his hosts Crystal Palace , totalling 45 points in his previous five thanks to five goals and two assists. Away from home in 2022/23, Kane's total of 30 shots is more than any other player. \n Aleksandar Mitrovic (FUL) \u00a37.1m \n Fulham\u2019s forward looks set to be Haaland\u2019s main rival for the captaincy due to his DGW. When considering the armband, Mitrovic\u2019s owners should be aware he is one booking away from a single-match ban. If he is cautioned against Leicester, he would then miss the second fixture of his Double, at home to Chelsea.\u00a0 \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  DGW19 Ones to watch Part 2:  DGW19 Differentials Part 4:  DGW19 Captains \n",

Eleven seconds after the restart  Callum Wilson  scored his 10th goal against the Hammers and his first in the league since October. \n But  David Moyes ' men responded after a nightmare start,  Lucas Paqueta  equalising from a corner. The Hammers continued to thwart Newcastle, who drew their fourth match in five in the league and drop to fourth, four points clear of Spurs. \n The result keeps West Ham in 16th, a point above the relegation zone.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n Mitoma strikes again \n A late goal from in-form  Kaoru Mitoma  gave  Brighton & Hove Albion  a narrow victory over  AFC Bournemouth .

I do think the value of the Wildcard diminishes the deeper we go into the season, so I will be absolutely switched on in the latter half of this week to see if an opportunity presents itself. \n See:  How midweek FA Cup ties will affect FPL managers \n Geoff Dance ( @GeoffreyDance ) \n So much will change this week, in terms of FPL managers' strategy for playing their chips. I still have my second Wildcard, Bench Boost and Free Hit to play. \n My current thinking to maximise all three chips is to Wildcard in Gameweek 26, Bench Boost in Double Gameweek 27 and Free Hit in  Blank Gameweek 28 .\u00a0 \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n The FA Cup is going to be all important in my chip strategy. In my current team, I have seven players who will definitely be available in BGW28. If the FA Cup fixtures are kind, I plan to play my Free Hit in Double Gameweek 29, when 12 teams play twice. \n However, if the FA Cup means a number of my players don't have a fixture in BGW28, I will Free Hit in that week and then Wildcard into DGW29, to maximise my team. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @Zophar666 ) \n If\u00a0 Leeds United  beat  Fulham \u00a0in the FA Cup, I would have my\u00a0 Liverpool  trio and  Andreas Pereira  (\u00a34.4m)\u00a0available for BGW28, which would save me Free-Hitting that week.  \n I am currently planning on using the Free Hit around Gameweek 32 and then Wildcard in Gameweek 33.\u00a0 \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n If Liverpool and Fulham end up with a BGW28, I'll plan to Wildcard this week, Free Hit in BGW28 and potentially Bench Boost in the big DGW29. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n If Liverpool and Fulham Does not go ahead due to the latter's participation in the FA Cup, I may be forced to Free Hit in BGW28. This would allow me to concentrate my transfers on those doubling in Gameweek 27 and Gameweek 29, which could become a Bench Boost option for me.  \n I'm planning to Wildcard in Gameweek 33 to set myself up well for the Doubles at the end of the season. \n Jamie Pigott ( @Futbolislifefpl ) \n I'm trying to weather the storm between Gameweeks 27-29 with free transfers and deploy my chips later.  \n This worked well for me last year and while every season is different, I like the upside.

Sanchez earned four points against  Manchester United , making five saves and collecting one bonus point in his side's  2-1 away win . \n Trent Alexander-Arnold (LIV) \u00a37.5m \n Liverpool\u2019s right-back claimed five double-figure scores at home last season, underlining his captaincy potential.\u00a0 \n Joao Cancelo (MCI) \u00a37.0m \n His 81 shots were more than any other Man City player in 2021/22.\u00a0 \n Gabriel (ARS) \u00a35.0m \n Arsenal\u2019 s centre-back had big success at both ends of the pitch in his two meetings with  Leicester City  last term. Gabriel combined a goal and two clean sheets with three bonus, totalling 21 points.\u00a0 \n Lucas Digne (AVL) \u00a35.0m \n The  Aston Villa  left-back offers potential at both ends of the pitch  at home to Everton . Digne\u2019s 34 key passes and four assists both ranked second for Villa after Steven Gerrard was appointed head coach in Gameweek 12 last term. \n Mohamed Salah (LIV) \u00a313.0m \n Liverpool\u2019s talisman was captained by nearly 3.3million managers in Gameweek 1 and is expected to be the most-selected pick once again. \n Phil Foden (MCI) \u00a38.0m \n An ownership of 6.4 per cent makes the England star a huge differential against AFC Bournemouth. \n Gabriel Martinelli (ARS) \u00a36.1m \n The Brazilian\u2019s 11 big chances in home matches was a team-leading total for Arsenal last term. Martinelli is the second most-owned midfielder in Fantasy, found in 25.8 per cent of squads. \n Jack Harrison (LEE) \u00a36.0m \n The  Leeds United  winger created six chances in Gameweek 1, more than any other player. Harrison scored in three of his final five away matches last season, highlighting his all-round threat  against Southampton .\u00a0 \n Erling Haaland (MCI) \u00a311.6m \n The forward was involved in a goal every 69.8 minutes in his final two league seasons with Borussia Dortmund. \n Darwin Nunez (LIV) \u00a39.0m \n Despite featuring as a second-half substitute at Fulham, Nunez\u2019s three big chances placed second only to Haaland in Gameweek 1. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  GW2 Captains: Haaland can threaten Salah's No 1 status \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout's panel of  Fantasy Premier League  experts share their thoughts on the players they are looking to transfer in for Double Gameweek 20 ahead of  Friday's 18:30 GMT deadline . \n Lee Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n I loved the way  Son Heung-min  (\u00a311.6m) ripped off his mask when he celebrated his goal in the  4-0 win at Crystal Palace , relieved to have finally ended his goalscoring drought. Could this be a turning point for the South Korean? \n We know his FPL potential, especially playing two teams in DGW20 that will attack and go for the points - potentially leaving space for Son on the counter-attack. Owned by only six per cent of managers, he could be a season-changer if you're falling behind in your mini-leagues.  \n Likewise, with  Manchester United  also playing twice,\u00a0 Bruno Fernandes  (\u00a39.8m) could offer managers a good differential. \n \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 2 \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n CRY \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 1 \n \n MUN \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 2 \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n CHE \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 0 \n \n CRY \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n MUN \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 1 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Ben Crabtree\u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n Harry Kane  (\u00a311.6m) and  Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.2m) \u00a0 look the two safest picks and will battle it out for captaincy.  Kevin De Bruyne  (\u00a312.5m) feels like he is due a big return, so I'd prioritise him in third.  \n After that, it's more punts and players who may not play much more than 90 minutes across the two matches.  Jack Grealish  (\u00a36.8m) could finally be an option if he recovers from illness. \n Some managers may find it suits them better to look at  John Stones  (\u00a35.4m),  Rico Lewis  (\u00a33.9m) or hoping for an attacking return from  Ivan Perisic  (\u00a35.5m) or  Matt Doherty  (\u00a34.6m). \n See:\u00a0 Man Utd given Double Gameweek 20 in FPL \n Sam Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n I was already invested in  Kane ,  Joao Cancelo  (\u00a37.3m) and \u00a0Haaland  ahead of the DGW20. With the announcement that Man Utd and  Crystal Palace  will also play twice, I now also have  Luke Shaw  (\u00a35.1m)\u00a0and  Marcus Rashford  (\u00a37.0m) \u00a0 with two fixtures. \n There are a couple of other players that I am thinking about investing in ahead of Friday's deadline. Selecting a  Manchester City  midfielder always comes as a risk due to Pep Guardiola's constant shuffling of his pack. But if you can afford him,  De Bruyne  is probably the safest option, particularly after a rest in the FA Cup.  \n I would also look at the likes of  Grealish \u00a0or  Riyad Mahrez  (\u00a37.5m), knowing they may only start in one of the fixtures. Grealish missed the FA Cup entirely through illness and therefore should be available for DGW20. Mahrez's minutes are more concerning given he played the full 90 minutes versus  Chelsea  in the cup but his form could make the risk worthwhile.  \n I am also considering tripling up on Man Utd as the in-form team right now. Adding  Fernandes  to Shaw and Rashford should be the perfect combination, especially given Palace's shaky defence. If you own  Wilfried Zaha  (\u00a37.3m) then hold for the Double, although I wouldn't prioritise investing in Palace based on their recent form. \n Pranil Sheth ( @Lateriser12 )\u00a0 \n Given that Man City quickly have a second Double in Gameweek 23, getting the right three from that team is pivotal.  De Bruyne ,  Haaland \u00a0and one of  Stones \u00a0or \u00a0Mahrez \u00a0are the players I would consider.  \n Man Utd have a good run of fixtures after the Double Gameweek too, so  Rashford \u00a0and  Shaw \u00a0are a must. \n Nick\u00a0 ( @WGTA_Nick )\u00a0 \n The one key man at  Tottenham Hotspur  for DGW20 is \u00a0Kane  and despite a middling season for the club, he is on track for his best-ever points haul in Fantasy, with 127 points after 18 matches.  \n There has been heavy rotation at Man City recently, meaning many of the popular players such as\u00a0 Phil Foden  (\u00a38.2m) and \u00a0Cancelo  may not play both matches. But  De Bruyne  is the one who is key for Pep in midfield and one that is likely to find his form again sooner rather than later.  \n From Man Utd,  Rashford  is in incredible form and looks essential at his price point. Otherwise, the likes of \u00a0Shaw ,  Diogo Dalot  (\u00a34.7m),  Fernandes  and  Anthony Martial  (\u00a36.6m) could all be interesting picks.  \n I'm not convinced by anyone at this moment from Palace but  Eberechi Eze  (\u00a35.6m) and  Michael Olise  (\u00a35.4m) could be fun differentials to own. \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n Haaland  and  De Bruyne  are the standout attacking picks from Man City.  Mahrez 's form also makes him an exciting punt. In defence, it is hard to make a case for anyone given the recent benchings for  Cancelo . I am still hoping he comes through as the the go-to third asset to own. Otherwise,\u00a0 Stones  has looked assured and has started the majority of matches since the season resumed.  Ederson \u00a0(\u00a35.4m) is the other, albeit low upside option.  \n From Spurs, despite the resurgence of  Son ,\u00a0 Perisic  and  Doherty  versus Palace, I would still only look at \u00a0Kane  if you can get get to him easily given the unfavourable fixtures.\u00a0 \n I'd rate  Rashford  the highest in terms of priority from Man Utd given his scintillating form.  Fernandes ,  Antony  (\u00a37.4m) and  Martial  are all decent options, but alongside, not instead of Rashford.  \n In defence, \u00a0Shaw  and  Dalot  should both be assured of starts and are good options. Dalot may be better for bonus points given his pass completion and tackles, but Shaw could provide more attacking returns given he plays further forward and is on set-pieces. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n I think getting the right Man City players in place is key given they have another Double in Gameweek 23. For me, \u00a0De Bruyne  should be top of the list. Spurs investment is optional due to their DGW20 being less favourable.\u00a0 \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n While our focus should still be on the most explosive team in the league, Man City,\u00a0 Kane ,  Shaw  and  Rashford  are all playing so well at the moment that if you don't own them, I would consider taking a hit to get the trio in your team. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 DGW20 Scout Selection Part 2:\u00a0 DGW20 Captains: Rashford and Kane can rival Haaland Part 3:  Time to Triple Captain Haaland in DGW20? \n",

Only  Newcastle United  and Man City have allowed opponents fewer shots. \n Sunday's 1-0 victory over  Leeds United , which turned out of be  Jesse Marsch 's final match as Leeds head coach after he was relieved of his duties on Monday, saw an impressive Premier League debut by goalkeeper  Keylor Navas . \n \n \n \n \n \n NFO \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 0 \n \n LEE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n The experienced Costa Rican made four crucial saves as Forest moved six points clear of 18th-placed  Everton . Who will be first-choice when  Dean Henderson  returns following a thigh injury? \n Forest have now earned more points (11) in their last five matches than both Arsenal (10) and Man City (nine), and in particular look to have found a winning formula at the City Ground - four of their five home wins have been by a 1-0 scoreline. \n Johnson in fine company \n Brennan Johnson 's superb 14th-minute strike means the Wales international has now been directly involved in each of Forest's last five Premier League goals (three goals and two assists). \n He has scored five goals in 2022/23, with only  Gabriel Martinelli  and  Bukayo Saka , with seven each, netting more of the players aged 21 or under. \n Crucially, Johnson's goals have earned Forest seven points this season. \n Johnson's pace and dribbling ability on the counter-attack is a key component of Cooper's game plan at Forest. Despite all the new arrivals at the City Ground over the last two transfer windows, it is a homegrown talent that is arguably their most important player. \n \n \n \n \n \n FUL \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 0 \n \n NFO \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Up next for Johnson and Forest is a trip to  Fulham , who have failed to keep a clean sheet in each of their last four at Craven Cottage. \n",

He'll likely be my transfer in.\u00a0 \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n I liked  Aston Villa 's reaction to winning a point at Anfield. They're really fighting for European football. Given Unai Emery's UEFA Europa League pedigree, who can blame them? \n I fancy  Jacob Ramsey  (\u00a35.1m) or  Ollie Watkins  (\u00a37.3m) as decent differentials  at home to Brighton & Hove Albion  on the final day. \n See:  How to make a final surge in Gameweek 38 \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @Zophar666 ) \n Eberechi Eze  (\u00a35.6m) and  Dwight McNeil  (\u00a35.1m) would be my top two differential picks. \n Crystal Palace  face a  Nottingham Forest side at home  who are already safe while  Everton  need a win against  AFC Bournemouth  to secure safety. \n Nick Harris ( @WGTA_Nick ) \n Eze  and  Michael Olise  (\u00a35.3m) have both had decent seasons and could be excellent differentials in Roy Hodgson's last match.\u00a0 \n Pras ( @Pras_FPL ) \n Generally in Gameweek 38 I try to target free-flowing home teams facing an opponent with not much to play for. \n Palace against Forest fits into this category, so \u00a0Eze  and  Olise  are good punts. The former could also be on penalties as  Wilfried Zaha  (\u00a37.2m) is out. \n Another fixture fitting this criteria is Arsenal against Wolves. On that basis,  Trossard ,  Martin Odegaard  (\u00a36.8m) or  Bukayo Saka  (\u00a38.0m) are good picks despite their recent indifferent form. \n Sam Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n A differential coming good on the final day can provide a real moment of joy. \n Everton defender  James Tarkowski  (\u00a34.1m) is on my radar this week. The Toffees need to win to secure their Premier League status for another season and face a Bournemouth side who have conceded 181 set-pieces - more than any other side. Tarkowski is excellent from dead balls and could exploit the Cherries' weakness in that area. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 How to make a final surge in Gameweek 38 \n Don't forget, the GW38 deadline is 15:00 BST on Sunday 28 May \n",

His 865 successful passes rank first for Arsenal and third among all defenders this season. \n That has helped Saliba earn bonus points on five of the seven occasions he has kept a clean sheet. \n Bonus king Dalot\u00a0 \n Manchester United \u2019s Diogo Dalot   (\u00a34.8m) is another major beneficiary of the BPS thanks to his all-round displays. \n The Portuguese has been awarded the maximum three bonus points in four of the five matches he has kept a clean sheet. \n Indeed, despite producing just one assist in the first 16 Gameweeks, Dalot has picked up 12 bonus points, second only to Trippier in defence. \n Man Utd have a very favourable schedule once domestic action resumes, lifting the appeal of investing in Dalot during the unlimited free transfers period. \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), seven of their next nine matches score only two. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Start Ward and free up funds Part 3:\u00a0 Target goalscoring centre-backs Part 4:  Forward role helping Rodrigo thrive Part 5:\u00a0 Foden leads midfielders who thrive at home Part 6:  FPL unlimited transfers: Build around Salah and Haaland Part 7:  Kane a strong partner for Haaland Part 8:\u00a0 Solanke revived under new head coach \n",

Mahrez can get more returns  against a Brentford  side with one clean sheet in their last seven at home. \n Eberechi Eze (CRY) \u00a35.7m \n The Eagles attacker has been their standout performer in Fantasy since the return of Roy Hodgson as manager. Eze has scored six goals and supplied two assists in their subsequent nine fixtures, averaging 7.2 points per match. \n Dwight McNeil (EVE) \u00a35.1m \n The winger\u2019s all-round contribution has been a major factor in Everton\u2019s bid to avoid relegation.

Kane recorded an 11-point return in his previous meeting with his hosts,  Leeds United , producing a goal and an assist in Gameweek 16. \n Julian Alvarez (MCI) \u00a36.1m \n After featuring as a substitute against  Brighton & Hove Albion  in midweek, the Argentinian looks set to return to the Man City starting XI against Brentford.

They are also in excellent form. \n Gundogan is a goalscoring midfielder, netting 21 times in the Premier League across the previous two seasons. \n He has two more to his name already this term, popping up in trademark fashion to score against  AFC Bournemouth  and  Newcastle United  from inside the box. \n Gundogan's goal v Newcastle \n \n \n . @IlkayGuendogan  starting off the scoring! \ud83c\udf66 #ManCity   pic.twitter.com/GCaACwHzrM \n\u2014 Manchester City (@ManCity)  August 21, 2022 \n \n The 31-year-old is also an underrated creative influence for City. \n Gundogan may not have topped four league assists in a top-flight season yet, but he has been outstanding when it comes to creating chances so far this term. \n Chances created from open play 2022/23 \n \n \n \n Player \n Club \n Total per 90 \n \n \n \n \n Mohamed Salah \n LIV \n 4 \n \n \n Kevin De Bruyne \n MCI \n 2.83 \n \n \n Daniel Podence \n WOL \n 2.62 \n \n \n Ilkay Gundogan \n MCI \n 2.54 \n \n \n Gabriel Martinelli \n ARS \n 2.24 \n \n \n \n *  Minimum four starts \n Laying on 16 chances in open play from seven appearances, five of which were starts, the Germany international is among the division's leading creators. \n Only three players, including City team-mate  Kevin De Bruyne , can better his ratio per 90 minutes. \n Eriksen impact \n Heading into the 2022/23 campaign there was uncertainty over where Eriksen would be used in  Erik ten Hag \u2019s starting XI, especially in a side containing  Bruno Fernandes . \n But those doubts have been quickly dispelled, with Eriksen establishing himself in a more orthodox central-midfield role alongside  Scott McTominay . \n Eriksen was exceptional in Man Utd's eye-catching  3-1 success against leaders Arsenal .\u00a0 \n Playing a decisive role in all three goals, his vision and execution of progressive passes stood out. \n His awareness of space also shone through when he ran in behind a high Gunners backline to set up  Marcus Rashford  for the third goal. \n Eriksen's creative influence 2022/23 \n \n \n \n Eriksen \n Total \n Club rank \n \n \n \n \n Passes into box \n 33 \n 1st \n \n \n Succ. passes in opp. half \n 145 \n 1st \n \n \n Shots on target \n 6 \n 1st \n \n \n Ball recoveries \n 39 \n 1st \n \n \n Shots \n 12 \n 2nd \n \n \n \n Eriksen's experiences with Ajax,  Tottenham Hotspur  and Inter Milan prepared him well for the mentality required to thrive under pressure at a club the size of United and he has settled quickly. \n When in possession he brings an air of calm to his new side's play, and is happy to attempt brave forward passes. Eriksen has unquestionably improved United's build-up play. \n Attacking verve \n No-one has made more successful passes in the opposition half or fed a greater number of passes into the box than the Dane, who played so well for  Brentford \u00a0last term. \n The 30-year-old has also shown the confidence to push on and try his luck with shots on goal; he leads United's rankings for shots on target. \n Eriksen and Gundogan have shown great confidence and intelligence this season and it could well be the better schemer on the day who determines the winner of the derby. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 Chelsea set to benefit from Potter's flexible changes Part 2:\u00a0 How O'Neil's changes have lifted AFC Bournemouth Part 3:\u00a0 How Ten Hag's short-term planning has revived Man Utd Part 4:  Bowen and Antonio can provide missing spark for West Ham Part 6:  Xhaka relishing more freedom at Arsenal \n",

James has combined a goal and an assist with a clean sheet and five bonus, highlighting his many routes to returns  at Southampton . \n Gabriel (ARS) \u00a35.0m \n The centre-back\u2019s total of five goals last season was joint-top among defenders.\u00a0 \n Kevin De Bruyne (MCI) \u00a312.2m \n The playmaker is likely to offer a rotation-free route into Man City\u2019s attack over the busy schedule.

If not, I just ignore it,\u201d he adds. \n \u201cI actively avoid trying to take hits. But when it comes to Double Gameweeks and Blank Gameweeks, they usually tend to pay off more frequently. \n Making the most of Blank and Double Gameweeks \n Indeed, six of Jahangirov\u2019s final seven points hits were taken in either Double or Blank Gameweeks. \n Those six hits all came in a 12-Gameweek period between GW20 and GW31 as he looked to take advantage of the schedule. \n Jahangirov sat in 1,867th position at the start of that period.\u00a0 \n Despite those points deductions, he had climbed to fourth spot by GW25 and never left the top five for the remainder of the season. \n Jahangirov limited his need for hits by keeping faith in his players and waiting until the changes in schedule. \n By focussing mainly on the BGW and DGWs later in the season, he was able to negate any points deductions while simultaneously strengthening his squad for the run-in. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 FPL champion: I thought I'd lost it on the final day Part 2:\u00a0 FPL champion: The one thing I changed to win title Part 3:  FPL champion's tips: Be flexible with your Gameweek 1 squad Part 4:\u00a0 FPL champion's tips: Play first Wildcard late Part 5:  FPL champion's tips: Getting the most from budget enablers Part 6:  FPL champion\u2019s tips: Differential captains can pay off \n",

        "text": "\n All 20 Premier League clubs were in action as the FA Cup third round kicked off over the weekend. Here is what we learned. \n Nketiah burnishes credentials \n It took a while for  Arsenal  to get going, but they finally found their rhythm at Oxford United, winning 3-0 thanks in part to  Eddie Nketiah . \n With the  long-term injury to Gabriel Jesus , Nketiah has stepped in successfully, adding a brace last night to his two league goals in three appearances.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n \"The decision-making to wait to the last moment shows his quality,\"  Mikel Arteta  told  the club's official website . \"It's not only that - his understanding, his work-rate I think is getting better and better. And I'm really happy with him.\" \n With a north London derby on the horizon, Nketiah is proving a valuable asset.\u00a0 \n Record exit \n Eight Premier League clubs exited at the first opportunity and at least a ninth is guaranteed from  Liverpool  or  Wolverhampton Wanderers , who play a replay next week. \n That will equal the highest such number, back in 2007/08, and it could even be 10 if  Leeds United  lose their replay with Cardiff City. \n Five exits were inevitable, being all-Premier League ties. But for  AFC Bournemouth  and  Everton , the FA Cup defeats mirrored their struggling form in the Premier League, which is the only remaining competition left to them and something upon which to train their full attention given their lowly positions in the table. \n Of the others who went out,  Newcastle United  and  Nottingham Forest  still have other interests, in the EFL Cup this week, while for  Chelsea \u00a0winning the UEFA Champions League might become their best means of qualifying for the competition next season. \n No Haaland, no problem \u00a0 \n If Premier League rivals thought a  Manchester City  team without  Erling Haaland  and  Kevin De Bruyne  would struggle for goals, they will have to think again as  Pep Guardiola 's men hit four past Chelsea. \n Julian Alvarez  offers a different option to Haaland but looks no less effective without it, scoring on his return from the FIFA World Cup 2022. \n The displays of the City Academy prospects such as  Cole Palmer  and  Rico Lewis  alongside more established talent such as  Riyad Mahrez  and  Kyle Walker  makes it even more difficult to establish what is Guardiola\u2019s first XI and makes the fixture pile-up that City face less daunting. \n City fixture pile-up \n Fresh from the FA Cup, the Premier League champions are next involved in the quarter-finals of the EFL Cup this Wednesday and their forthcoming fixtures make for an unflinching glance into what competing on four fronts looks like. \n \n \n \n \n \n MUN \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 1 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 2 \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n 3 - 0 \n \n WOL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 0 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n City are set to play 11 matches in 45 days. \n Those matches include the Manchester derby this Saturday and two fixtures against  Tottenham Hotspur  in the space of 17 days. \n Even a squad as deep as Man City\u2019s looks set to be tested. \n \u00a0 Chelsea struggling \u00a0 \n It is no disgrace to lose to City \u2013 most teams do \u2013 but the nature of the defeat at the Etihad Stadium will be a concern to Chelsea supporters . \u00a0 \n As well as conceding four times, the Blues' struggles to create chances continued as head coach  Graham Potter  identified: \"We're not in a great moment ourselves and even though it was a cagey first 20 minutes, we couldn't attack the back line well enough.\" \n Chelsea are a side in transition and have not been helped by injuries to key players such as  Raheem Sterling ,  Reece James ,  Ben Chilwell  and  N\u2019Golo Kante . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Their fans will hope the signing of  David Datro Fofana  from Molde can inject life into their attack, although press reports suggest further attacking reinforcements might be on the way, with Atletico Madrid\u2019s Joao Felix linked with a loan move. \n Chelsea are closer to the bottom of the table (13 points) than to the top (19 points), so Potter will be keen to rediscover their scoring touch, starting with a tricky looking encounter this  Thursday against Fulham . \n Brighton rock \u00a0 \n Apart from a poor start at  home to Arsenal ,  Roberto De Zerbi  has got  Brighton & Hove Albion  playing a brand of football Potter can only dream of. \n Brighton routed in-form Middlesbrough 5-1 on Saturday, including a brace from the returning  Alexis Mac Allister . The World Cup-winning midfielder benefited from a more advanced role similar to where he played for Argentina. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n \"He played higher today, and he can help us find the last pass and the goal,\" De Zerbi told the club\u2019s official website. \"He has the quality to score many goals.\" \n It could presage a new set-up for the Seagulls that may give Liverpool something extra to think about when they visit the Amex Stadium on Saturday. \n New Year, new signing, new hope \n The FA Cup offered some solace for two teams struggling in the league.  Southampton  claimed a much-needed win for manager  Nathan Jones  in beating  Crystal Palace  ahead of their  trip to relegation rivals Everton  on Saturday. \n Saints face Man City in the EFL Cup on Wednesday first, but will then hope the away victory at Selhurst Park can encourage an improvement in their league form, which reads: played six, lost six. New signing  Mislav Orsic  could help on that front too. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Wolves' uplift under  Julen Lopetegui  continued as they impressed in the 2-2 draw at Liverpool in the FA Cup. With new arrival  Matheus Cunha  now showing flashes of promise, the  visit on Saturday of fellow strugglers West Ham United , who have mustered a singular point in six matches, looks a much more enticing prospect. \n",

Stones has two goals and an assist in his last four matches across all competitions, netting against  Leicester City  and  Arsenal  to claim 17 points in his previous two league outings. \n Pervis Estupinan (BHA) \u00a34.8m \n Five assists and seven clean sheets highlight his all-round potential for Brighton\u2019s two home encounters. \n Estupinan\u2019s impact down the left has been vital to his side\u2019s attack this season; he has created 36 chances, placing him third among all Seagulls players.\u00a0 \n Mohamed Salah (LIV) \u00a313.0m \n Liverpool\u2019s Egyptian has five goals, two assists and 41 points across his last four outings at Anfield. \n Salah\u2019s total of 63 shots in home matches is more than any other player in 2022/23 Fantasy, showing his huge armband appeal as a rival to Man City\u2019s Haaland. \n Jack Grealish (MCI) \u00a37.3m \n The winger has two goals, three assists and 32 points in his previous four appearances. \n Grealish has been immune to Pep Guardiola\u2019s rotation lately, starting each of their last 13 league matches ahead of meetings\u00a0 with Fulham  and  West Ham . \n Marcus Rashford (MUN) \u00a37.1m \n Rashford is the top-scoring player in Fantasy since Gameweek 17, producing 12 goals, four assists and 124 points. \n The England international's 12-point haul against Spurs on Thursday was his eighth double-figure return of 2022/23 Fantasy and helped him move to 186 points, his best-ever FPL campaign. \n Kaoru Mitoma (BHA) \u00a35.6m \n The Japanese star has blanked in only one of his seven home matches since the season resumed, producing four goals, three assists and 52 points. \n Mitoma is the most popular Brighton player by some margin, owned by more than 27 per cent of managers.\u00a0 \n Solly March (BHA) \u00a35.3m \n His 22 chances created in the last six Gameweeks are a league-leading total. \n Erling Haaland (MCI) \u00a312.3m \n His 14-point return against Arsenal in midweek was the Norwegian\u2019s third successive double-figure haul, the first time he has achieved this feat in his remarkable debut campaign. \n An ownership of 81 per cent means it will be a brave manager who opts to overlook Haaland for the armband.\u00a0 \n Diogo Jota (LIV) \u00a38.9m \n Liverpool\u2019s Portuguese has scored twice and produced double-digit returns in two of his last three appearances. \n Although he could have his minutes managed over his two matches, Jota\u2019s ability to deliver big scores still makes him worth the risk as the Reds push for a top-four finish. \n Next:  The Scout's best FPL captains for DGW34 \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  The Scout\u2019s FPL Double Gameweek 34 Ones to watch Part 2:\u00a0 The Scout\u2019s FPL Double Gameweek 34 Differentials Part 4:  The Scout's best captains for Double Gameweek 34 Part 5:  FPL experts: The best players on a single Gameweek \n",

        "text": "\n With  Manchester City  and  Arsenal  both blanking in Gameweek 12 before embarking on kind schedules from Gameweek 13-16, The Scout's panel of  Fantasy Premier League  experts discuss their strategies. \n What the experts say \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n As someone who is planning to Wildcard ahead of Gameweek 13, my strategy with Man City and Arsenal players needs to be right. They have been so consistent, so I don't want to sell them until Blank Gameweek 12.  \n Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a38.0m) is now back at his starting price. This makes him an easy sell after Gameweek 11 as I will be able to bring him back on a Wildcard for the same price I am selling him. I will probably take a chance on someone like  Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang  (\u00a39.1m) in GW12 as he has a nice fixture  at Brentford . \n With  Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.2m),  Joao Cancelo  (\u00a37.3m) and  Gabriel Martinelli  (\u00a36.6m), I have money invested in them and will likely move them to my bench for the Blank, so I don't have to pay more to bring them back in again on my Wildcard the week after.  \n Wildcarding into GW13 should allow me to benefit from owning three Man City and three Arsenal players for their lovely run of fixtures up to the FIFA World Cup at a time when other managers will have had to sell their City and Arsenal players and likely have to take points hits to bring them back in, or go without. \n Kelly Somers\u00a0 ( @KellySomers ) \n As someone playing a Wildcard in GW13, I will be holding Haaland and Martinelli and benching them for the Blank. This is partly due to the number of transfers I have left to make ahead of Gameweek 12. However, it is also because managers should be conscious of how much money they have tied up in a player. \n I have been toying with the idea of removing Martinelli, but because I have owned him since GW1 he will cost more for me to buy back on Wildcard. Instead I will sell Jesus, but not because I want to, but because I haven't got as much money tied up in him and therefore can bring him back in more easily after GW12 on Wildcard.\u00a0 \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n Holding at least three of your City and Arsenal players is a good idea, particularly the ones that you would lose value on if you sold and will want back soon. Haaland, Cancelo and Martinelli will remain in my squad. However, I will likely look to sell  Kevin De Bruyne  (\u00a312.4m) with a plan to replace him with  Phil Foden  (\u00a38.2m) after Blank Gameweek 12. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Holding three or four players from City and Arsenal combined is perfectly fine, even if it means going into Blank Gameweek 12 with only 10 players. \n After the Blank, City and Arsenal's excellent fixtures to the FIFA World Cup mean holding these players through GW12 will allow managers to take advantage without needing to take points hits and precious transfers to bring them straight back in.\u00a0 \n Ben Crabtree\u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n I will be holding a total of three City and Arsenal players through Blank Gameweek 12.  \n I'm happy as long as I have 11 players, as cheaper players like  Andreas Pereira  (\u00a34.6m) can come off my bench and have the potential to deliver, as shown in a third of his appearances this season. None of the fixtures in GW12 make me want to sell any City players, especially as I will want them back after the Blank. \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n Keep Man City and Arsenal players this week ahead of the Blank. They are just too good right now!  \n When it comes to Blank GW12, hold those who you have most valued tied up in, which are likely to be Haaland and Martinelli. It's fine to keep three or four players you know you'll want back come GW13. \n Nick\u00a0( @WGTA_Nick ) \n I see no issue with benching three of Arsenal and City's players and giving the likes of Pereira a run-out  against Aston Villa .  \n If you sell your Arsenal and City players you will likely just be transferring them straight back in after their Blanks for matches  against Southampton  and  Brighton & Hove Albion  respectively. \n Geoff Dance\u00a0( @GeoffreyDance ) \n For managers who have played their Wildcard and want to capitalise on the fixtures for these two clubs in GW11 and GW13-16, they could consider playing the Free Hit chip in Blank Gameweek 12. Managers could hold their Arsenal and City players and add more to their team now, knowing they could then build a Free-Hit team to target the best fixtures in GW12 and have the Arsenal and Man City stars back for GW13.\u00a0 \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  GW10 Bonus points Part 2:  GW10 stats: Haaland breaks more records as he hits century Part 3:  Saturday review: Top midfielder Foden is No 1 target Part 4:\u00a0 GW10 Lessons: Prepare for Arsenal and Man City's Blank \n",

If you still have your Triple Captain chip left to play, you should use it on the Norwegian this week.  \n Joao Cancelo 's departure has left a void at left-back and\u00a0 Nathan Ake 's (\u00a35.1m) versatility, which allows him to play there and at centre-back, puts him in a good place to start both matches in DGW23 and makes him a great pick. \n \n \n \n FPL expert \n Player 1 \n Player 2 \n Player 3 \n \n \n \n \n Utkarsh Dalmia \n Haaland \n De Bruyne \n Ake \n \n \n Gianni Buttice \n Haaland \n De Bruyne \n Lewis \n \n \n Lee Bonfield \n Haaland \n De Bruyne \n Lewis \n \n \n Lateriser \n Haaland \n Mahrez \n De Bruyne \n \n \n Sam Bonfield \n Haaland \n Mahrez \n De Bruyne \n \n \n Pras \n Haaland \n De Bruyne \n Mahrez \n \n \n \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n Despite lots of rotation, City's defence is still worth covering.  Rico Lewis  (\u00a33.9m) offers exceptional value, and with no Cancelo, feels like the only full-back that can play the inverted midfield role in possession. This makes me confident of Lewis starting the majority of matches. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Haaland \u00a0is definitely still the top Man City pick. The other two spots are more open to debate.  City, and Haaland especially, missed the creativity of\u00a0 Kevin De Bruyne \u00a0(\u00a312.4m) in the  1-0 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur . He'll come back in and should play both matches.\u00a0 \n Lateriser ( @lateriser12 ) \n Haaland  obviously has to be an autopick. Own the forward and hand him the armband.  Riyad\u00a0Mahrez  (\u00a37.7m) has made that right-wing spot his own and looks a great option for DGW23. \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Even though he failed to have a shot against Spurs in Gameweek 22,  Haaland  remains the best City pick this week.  \n Outside of Haaland, the City spots are tough.  Even with a 59th-minute substitution in Gameweek 22,\u00a0 Mahrez  is the best City player to own after the Norwegian. Mahrez has returned in five of City's Premier League matches since the season resumed and has registered just two points fewer than Haaland in that time. \n Pras ( @Pras_FPL ) \n As a  De Bruyne  owner, I am keeping faith. Both the recent benchings came against Spurs' back five, a formation that Man City's DGW23 opponents aren't likely to line up in. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  FPL experts: Who to target for Arsenal's Double Gameweek \n",

Both Man Utd and Spurs have been conceding chances.\u00a0 \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Double Gameweeks are always a good opportunity to play the Triple Captain chip. Most FPL managers will want to hand the armband to  Haaland.  However the fixtures against Man Utd and Spurs may not be the most appealing, although their must-win nature may strengthen the likelihood of him playing 90 minutes in both.  \n I will hold the chip for a more attractive set of Double Gameweek fixtures. However, if I were playing it this week I would give it to  Rashford  over Haaland, who has the form along with a great second fixture against Palace.  \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n Haaland 's minutes are as secure as they are ever going to be in this Double due to the calibre of Man City's opposition. In reality, the Norwegian can go big against anyone. He's a great Triple Captain option with rotation more of a concern as the season goes on. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n I'm not considering the Triple Captain this week. As good as  Haaland  is, I think there will be a better opportunity later in the season to use it, with either two more attractive fixtures for Haaland or another player with two great matches. \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n There are a lot of reasons to play the Triple Captain chip on \u00a0Haaland  this Gameweek. He is off the back of a World Cup break, is injury-free and also got a full rest in FA Cup third round.  \n Add to that the fact that outside of Gameweek 20 and Gameweek 23, other potential Double Gameweek windows will come around the Champions League stages. \n They could also present conflicting chip usage such as a Wildcard in Gameweek 29 and Bench Boost in Gameweek 34. Furthermore, \"harder\" fixtures also mean higher expected minutes and low risk of rotation. \n Don't forget the GW20 deadline is 18:30 GMT on Friday 13 January \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 Scout Selection: Best FPL team for DGW20 Part 2:\u00a0 DGW20 Captains: Rashford and Kane can rival Haaland \n",

        "text": "\n For long stretches of the 2022/23 season  Arsenal  looked destined to win their first title in 19 years. Yet by the time  Manchester City sealed their fifth crown in six seasons  it was clear  Pep Guardiola \u2019s team were far ahead of their nearest rivals, and even candidates to be considered the greatest ever Premier League side. \n The road to this point has not been smooth. Alex Keble looks at how Guardiola assembled his boldest and most unusual team yet and how, faced with the challenge of moulding his new striker to the Man City style,  Erling Haaland  ultimately changed how Guardiola sees the game. \n \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 2 \n \n CRY \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Cast your mind back to August and recall that not everyone was convinced Guardiola had acted wisely in the summer. \n It was extremely bold to allow  Oleksandr Zinchenko ,  Gabriel Jesus \u00a0and  Raheem Sterling  to depart while tearing down his \"false nine\" system to accommodate the most un-Guardiola-like striker imaginable, Haaland. And at half-time against  Crystal Palace  scepticism was justified. \n Man City were trailing 2-0 for the fourth time in six league matches, including their final two matches of the previous season  against West Ham United  and  Aston Villa . They had, once again, looked ponderous on the ball and stumped by an opposition low block. Haaland was stifled in a crowded penalty area and City had no point of difference \u2013 no incisive runner like Sterling, no weaving No 9 like Jesus \u2013 to shuffle the deck. \n Maybe this would not be their season. Maybe Haaland would need a year to settle in and Man City a year to learn how to adapt to a radically-altered tactical set-up. \n Nope. A second-half hat-trick from Haaland and a goal for  Bernardo Silva  reminded us of City\u2019s remarkable strength in depth as second-half changes from Guardiola unlocked the Palace defence. Deploying  Kyle Walker  and Silva in central midfield hadn\u2019t worked, but with both players now roaming out to the right flank Man City found a way of working around Palace\u2019s narrow defensive shell. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n It was a vital turnaround without which Man City might \u2013 with seven points from four matches \u2013 have struggled to recover. \n Still, even at the final whistle there was some concern about how Guardiola could keep City in control of matches with Haaland up front. There was plenty of hard work ahead. \n \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n 6 - 3 \n \n MUN \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Haaland is very good at the things he supposedly isn\u2019t very good at. That was the conclusion from a nine-goal Manchester derby that, despite the wild scoreline, was an emphatic victory for the hosts and proof beyond doubt Haaland did not need a period of adaptation. \n Hat-trick aside, Haaland was everywhere, dropping between the lines to link the play, confounding  Christian Eriksen  and  Scott McTominay  as he took 32 touches (his highest in a City shirt at the time) and completed six progressive passes (still his season best). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n But it wasn\u2019t all about Haaland. In the story of Man City\u2019s season this was the first example of a more rounded side capable of scoring in a variety of ways: from corners, from quick counters, or \u2013 and this was new \u2013 from  Jack Grealish  stealing the show like he did in his  Aston Villa  days. \n In the derby, Grealish finally arrived. He produced a season-high 10 shot-creating actions, gave  Diogo Dalot  a torrid afternoon, and frequently roamed into central areas, finally unshackled from the more rigid positions he was taking up in 2021/22. \n It felt as if Grealish had learnt, internalised and integrated the complex demands of his manager to the point where he was now free to improvise within that structure. Haaland was settling well and Grealish was dancing into space. Suddenly Guardiola\u2019s left turn towards florid superstars made perfect sense. \n And yet, another three goals conceded meant 13 from 11 in all competitions since the beginning of the season. The defensive side of things \u2013 the full-backs conundrum \u2013 still needed solving. \n \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 1 \n \n FUL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n When things weren\u2019t clicking, when vulnerabilities at the back still left us a little unsure, Man City needed to show they could win ugly.

Seven points from their last five matches was a wobble they could ill afford and, 2-0 down to  Tottenham Hotspur  at half-time, they were about to give Arsenal an 11-point lead at the season\u2019s halfway mark. \n The hero this time was  Riyad Mahrez . His dribble down the right created  Julian Alvarez \u2019s goal, the first of the comeback, before Mahrez assisted Haaland for the equaliser and then scored twice himself. What we had witnessed here, though we didn\u2019t know it at the time, was the beginning of a new approach for Man City in the final third. \n \n \n Right back in it! \ud83d\udca5 @Mahrez22 's first goal of the night was a belter \ud83d\ude4c  pic.twitter.com/fKt65LcckZ \n\u2014 Manchester City (@ManCity)  January 20, 2023 \n \n Guardiola found out that to counter-balance the speed and directness of Haaland, and to make up for the loss of touches that a \"false nine\" used to provide in the build-up, he needed wingers on each side who would slow the game right down. \n From here on in, Mahrez and Grealish would regularly play together, both taking lots of touches, waiting for their team-mates to get into position (and therefore shield against counter-attacks) while dragging defenders towards them \u2013 and away from Haaland. \n \n \n \n \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 3 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Did Arsenal lose control of the title race when they drew three times in a row before the  4-1 defeat  at the Etihad Stadium in April? In hindsight, the real momentum in shift came two months earlier, when the Gunners were unfortunate to face their title rivals at a similar moment of weakness. \n Arsenal had begun to feel the absence of the injured Jesus,  losing 1-0 at Everton  and  drawing 1-1 with Brentford , as Man City moved within three points of the league leaders before this six-pointer in mid-February. \n Once again, it was a match that highlighted the journey Haaland and Man City were on. \n Throughout the second third of the Premier League season, Guardiola gradually began to incorporate more direct moves, playing to Haaland\u2019s strengths by giving his team unprecedented freedom to sprint straight towards goal after winning the ball, rather than recycling possession as they historically had done. \n This was the pinnacle of that process, with all three Man City goals coming from turnovers high up the pitch. The crucial second goal, scored by Grealish, simply would not have happened in 2021/22. Bernardo Silva won possession on the halfway line and, with one through ball, set Haaland running. Two passes later City were 2-1 up. \n \n \n All of the highlights from our huge win against Arsenal! \ud83d\ude0d  pic.twitter.com/0ZtDndq7gj \n\u2014 Manchester City (@ManCity)  February 16, 2023 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n CRY \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 1 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n The last time Man City dropped points in the Premier League was in February, in a  1-1 draw with Nottingham Forest . After that, they became a winning machine, surgically dismantling teams, and it was only then that the season really turned in their favour. \n Technically that winning run started  at AFC Bournemouth , but spiritually it was at Selhurst Park, where the importance of Haaland\u2019s decisive 78th-minute penalty was trumped only by Guardiola\u2019s tactical tweak of putting  John Stones  in central midfield and doing away with full-backs altogether. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n The transition since then has been so complete that most now list City\u2019s starting formation as a back three. That\u2019s because, while Cancelo or  Rico Lewis  had been slipping into central midfield at various points this season, Stones at Palace was the first time City\u2019s supposed \"full-backs\" never overlapped in the final third. \n Playing four centre-backs, with one shuttling into midfield, might just be Guardiola\u2019s most outlandish tactical innovation to date, but it has worked. The 3-2 shape at the back has freed his midfielders (usually De Bruyne and  Ilkay Gundogan ) to get even higher, effectively recreating the \"W-M\" formation (3-2-2-3) that was common in the 1930s. \n In the W-M, the two No 8s could give closer support to Haaland, ensuring he was isolated less often, while also making runs ahead of Grealish and Mahrez. It meant the City wingers no longer had to attempt to beat a full-back every time they got the ball. \n \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 1 \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n The final nail in Arsenal\u2019s coffin was not just a resounding win for Man City but a victory lap of sorts: the coming-together of every element into a complete whole, a Bingo card of Guardiola\u2019s various tactical tweaks. \n City scored from a fast and direct attack through De Bruyne and Haaland, which showcased the latter\u2019s newfound ability to link the play; from a De Bruyne cross to the new star Stones; from a high turnover; and finally via Haaland, letting his hair down to add the flourish to a perfect debut campaign in England. \n The only thing missing was the use of centre-backs moved into central midfield. Guardiola sprang a surprise with a more traditional formation to unsettle Arsenal, sitting off slightly so his team could evade the Arsenal press and attack directly in behind. \n That reversion to \"normal\" full-backs showed us that, thanks to Haaland\u2019s introduction and the various changes his integration has required, Man City are now capable of playing in too many different styles and formations for anyone to track. \n They are the complete team and possibly the greatest the Premier League has ever seen. Looking back from the finish line, it turns out the problem of how to adapt to Haaland wasn\u2019t a problem at all, but rather inspiration for Guardiola to reach even greater heights. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 Man City are 2022/23 champions after Arsenal defeat Part 2:\u00a0 Why Man City can become the greatest champions of all Part 3:\u00a0 Man City lift Premier League Trophy after beating Chelsea Part 4:\u00a0 In pictures: Man City's title celebrations Part 5:  Haaland: Thirty-six goals and a PL Trophy, not a bad start Part 6:\u00a0 Gundogan: Fightback made this title special Part 7:\u00a0 Guardiola: Team deserve celebration after my demands Part 8:\u00a0 How Guardiola's tactics have evolved during his reign at City \n",

        "text": "\n With the season paused for the FIFA World Cup 2022,  Fantasy Premier League  experts have been tinkering with their squads. \n With FPL managers able to make  unlimited transfers  before 11:00 GMT 26 December,  Pras  talks us through his new squad for Gameweek 17. \n Goalkeepers \n Aaron Ramsdale  (\u00a34.9m): He has made fewer saves than at this stage last season, but getting a \u00a34.9m goalkeeper from an  Arsenal  defence is great value. \n Danny Ward  (\u00a34.1m):  Leicester City 's defence improved dramatically since Gameweek 9, with six clean sheets in eight matches. \n Defenders\u00a0 \n Joao Cancelo  (\u00a37.4m): His form has been slightly disappointing this season, but it will change. Cancelo has shown attacking threat in the lesser fixtures and  Manchester City  have a fantastic run of matches post World Cup. \n Kieran Trippier  (\u00a35.9m): He is the top-scoring defender in the game, as well as being on free-kicks and corners and is part of a strong  Newcastle United  defence. \n Diogo Dalot  (\u00a34.8m): The  Manchester United  defence has historically not been that great, but under Erik ten Hag they have improved a lot, especially with Casemiro (\u00a34.9m) coming into the team. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Ben White  (\u00a34.7m): He is exceptional value playing on the right, and we have seen him getting forward in recent Gameweeks. \n Sven Botman  (\u00a34.4m): He offers exceptional value as a regular starter. \n Midfielders\u00a0 \n Bukayo Saka  (\u00a38.0m): He is in my team at the moment, but his involvement will depend on how far England go in the World Cup. He is Arsenal's penalty-taker and is on corners too, meaning he has multiple routes to points. \n Marcus Rashford  (\u00a36.7m): When he attacks from the left channel and cuts back in and shoots from his right foot, he looks lethal. They  play Nottingham Forest  at home as well as  AFC Bournemouth  in the first three fixtures post World Cup. \n Dejan Kulusevski  (\u00a38.0m): Initially there were fears that he'd lose his place to Richarlison (\u00a38.4m) but that hasn\u2019t come to fruition and I see Kulusevski as a very important cog in  Tottenham Hotspur 's attack. \n Leandro Trossard  (\u00a37.1m): He has been exceptional this season and  Brighton & Hove Albion  will pick up where they left off after the World Cup. \n Phil Foden  (\u00a38.3m): Managers had feared that he had lost a bit of Pep Guardiola's faith after being benched in three consecutive fixtures. But Foden is still an important player in Pep's side, so I back him to start most of the games after the World Cup. \n Make changes to your own FPL squad now \n Forwards \n Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.2m): A striker that I will of course have on my unlimited transfers draft. He had some injury problems at the back end of this phase of the season but he will have a nice little rest given that Norway aren't in the World Cup. \n Callum Wilson (\u00a37.4m) : Another striker I want to own after the break is the Newcastle striker. Wilson, historically, been a player who takes his chances. \n Darwin Nunez  (\u00a39.0m): The  Liverpool  striker started slowly especially with his  red card in Gameweek 2 . But he came back into the team when Luis Diaz   (\u00a37.8m) and   Diogo Jota (\u00a38.8m) were injured and made the starting position his own. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Nick Harris' GW17 squad Part 2:  Andy Park's GW17 squad Part 3:  Gianni Buttice's GW17 squad Part 5:  Sam Bonfield's GW17 squad \n",

While I still think Haaland should be considered for the captaincy on a weekly basis, I don't think it is as cut and dried as it once was. Plus there are other assets who maybe have a better fixture. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Haaland  remains the highest-scoring player in the game as well as being the player who has scored the most goals.  \n However, Man City aren't playing at quite the same level they were at the start of the season, whereas teams like Arsenal and Man Utd have found their rhythm.  \n In some Gameweeks Haaland will be the best captaincy option, but don't be afraid to move the armband elsewhere to a player like  Saka ,  Odegaard  or  Rashford  if they have better form and/or fixtures.\u00a0 \n Pranil Sheth ( @lateriser12 ) \n I still think  Haaland  is the best captaincy option especially in Gameweek 21 where  Liverpool  play  Chelsea  and  Arsenal  play  Manchester United . Man City need the points and they can't afford to rest their main players at the moment. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n Haaland  remains the go-to captain option in my opinion. He's the focal point of one of the league's best attacks and has hat-trick potential in any match. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n Haaland  will be my captain, but I also like  Kevin De Bruyne  (\u00a312.5m) for some Man City matches. When the fixtures are right, I'd also have no issue captaining \u00a0Rashford ,  Saka  or even  Kieran Trippier\u00a0 (\u00a36.0m). \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n I can't see myself deviating from  Haaland  any time soon. Despite a dip in his underlying numbers and Man City's form, he still looks the best option. Hopefully, this is just a blip and things improve soon. \n Nick Harris ( @WGTA_Nick ) \n It has only been a couple of matches that \u00a0Haaland  has blanked. He still has a ridiculous haul of goals at the halfway point of the season and will likely be my captain pick.  \n Harry Kane  (\u00a311.6m) or  Rashford  on current form would be potential backup options if the fixtures are particularly kind. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n Man City are pretty reliable at home, where \u00a0Haaland  has the potential to produce big hauls, so I still think most will look to captain him against  Wolverhampton Wanderers  this weekend.  \n While Spurs have been inconsistent of late,  Kane  has looked sharp. He's been good away from home this season and  Fulham  will concede chances. Don't rule out captaining other players though, as they could bring fruitful rewards.\u00a0 \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n In a single Gameweek when \u00a0Haaland  is likely to start, he is still the captain choice regardless of Man City's form, in my opinion.  However, with doubles coming, various other options will emerge. That could be  Saka ,  Rashford ,\u00a0 Mohamed Salah  (\u00a312.8m),  Kane  or even  Trippier . \n",

Martinelli can exploit a  Wolves  side who have conceded at least three goals in back-to-back home matches. \n Marcus Rashford (MUN) \u00a36.7m \n The  Manchester United  star\u2019s 10 shots in the box over the last four Gameweeks are more than twice the tally of any team-mate.

It promises to be an exciting duel. \n Repelling danger \n It is hard to find another top-flight midfielder who breaks up play better than Rice. \n Playing on the left of a midfield pairing as part of a double pivot, his defensive work is a mixture of pressing inside the central third and repelling danger on the edge of his own box. \n Leading ball winners 2022/23 \n \n \n \n Ball recoveries \n Interceptions \n Poss. won middle third \n \n \n \n \n Rice \n 201 \n C.

        "summary": "The Scout's panel look at who is worth adding before the season pauses for the FIFA World Cup 2022",
        "text": "\n As the last Gameweek approaches before the season pauses for the FIFA World Cup 2022, The Scout's  panel of experts  discuss which players are worth adding to your  Fantasy Premier League  squad before  Saturday's 11:00 GMT deadline . \n See:\u00a0 FPL and FIFA World Cup: All you need to know about free transfers \n What the experts say \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Dejan Kulusevski  (\u00a38.0m) returned from injury in Gameweek 15 and assisted  Harry Kane  (\u00a311.6m) within two minutes of entering the field of play against  Liverpool  in Gameweek 15.  \n This was his fifth attacking return of the season in just eight appearances. Kulusevski was instrumental in  Tottenham Hotspur 's 4-0 victory over  Leeds  last season, scoring a goal, and he had more shots in the box in that fixture than any other player. Kulusevski is a huge differential owned by just 4.0 per cent of managers. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n Leon Bailey  (\u00a34.5m) has three returns in his last three matches and has got off to a good start under new manager Unai Emery. Despite the tough fixture against  Brighton & Hove Albion , I feel this could be a game well suited to him. Bailey is owned by just 4.4 per cent of managers.\u00a0 \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Given the yellow flags currently on  Aleksandar Mitrovic  (\u00a36.8m) and  Callum Wilson  (\u00a37.5m), FPL managers may be in the market for a budget striker. Look no further than  AFC Bournemouth 's 5.5 per cent-owned  Dominic Solanke  (\u00a35.8m). Up against an  Everton  defence who just conceded two goals at home to  Leicester City . \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n Andrew Robertson  (\u00a36.7m) is certainly on my radar as we see Liverpool's form improve and  Southampton  next seems a good opportunity for a clean sheet. Robertson is owned by just 4.1 per cent of the game. \n Nick ( @WGTA_Nick ) \n Darwin Nunez  (\u00a38.9m) hasn't quite lived up to his price tag to date. But the Liverpool forward could finally shine in a plum home match against Southampton. He is still a differential owned by just 8.7 per cent of managers.\u00a0 \n Andy Park ( @FPL_Sonaldo ) \n Whilst not a true differential because of his ownership  Ivan\u00a0 Perisic  (\u00a35.5m) springs to mind as a punt because of the Spurs wingback rotation.  \n They looked good in the second half against Liverpool and Perisic was basically highest up the pitch for Spurs; playing alongside Kane as a second striker.  With a home game against Leeds and a bounce-back win for Spurs a priority, a Perisic punt sounds exciting and sensible. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n Last week he was one of the most transferred-out players meaning that his ownership has decreased substantially. So even though he is over 20 per cent-owned  Wilfried\u00a0Zaha  (\u00a37.5m) should be a good punt for this week.  \n He played central last time out and rewarded his owners with a goal and an assist. When he's the most advanced  Crystal Palace  attacker, he's often a very good FPL asset and the fixture against  Nottingham Forest  looks a good one on paper. \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n I would start with some players from Man City,  Riyad Mahrez  (\u00a37.5m) or  Bernardo Silva  (\u00a36.9m) are good options if they start.  \n Liverpool, again some good picks there if budget allows,  Darwin  and  Andy Robertson  are good punts for the last Gameweek before the season pauses. At Spurs both  Perisic  and  Kulusevski  are good one-week picks too.\u00a0 \n Jamie Pigott ( @Futbolislifefpl ) \n My favorite punt for Gameweek 16 is  Darwin  if you can find space and budget for him.  \n Another one I would love to have if I could is  Kulusevski . He means so much to Spurs, which he proved at the weekend with his assist shortly after coming on as a substitute. He may not be rushed back in to the starting XI though, so keep an eye on Antonio Conte's press conference first. \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at key tactical points and players who can be decisive in Matchweek 22. \n Nathan Ake  &  Rico Lewis (MCI) \n Time never stands still in football and  Pep Guardiola 's surprise decision to offload  Joao Cancelo  to Bayern Munich on loan shows he will not allow  Manchester City 's starting XI to become stagnant. \n \"After the World Cup, we made a pre-season and started to play in a different way in some patterns,\" Guardiola  told City's website  when asked about why he let Cancelo leave. \"I liked what I watched and I decided to give more time to players who I saw on the pitch who liked it.\" \n So what changed? \n Cancelo had featured in 17 out of 20 Premier League matches this term, starting 16 of those but a downturn in form coupled with the rise of Nathan Ake and Rico Lewis has prompted a sudden shake-up. \n From hero to zero matches \n Cancelo was named in the PFA Team of the Year in both 2020/21 and 2021/22, impressing with his outstanding distribution, creativity and adventure. \n See:\u00a0 Guardiola's rotation could be decisive in duel with Arteta \n His marauding style was a perfect match for Guardiola's fluid formation. He regularly popped up in central areas, often inside the final third. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Last season he provided seven assists and, remarkably, he ended the campaign having attempted more shots than any other City player. \n This season the 28-year-old has been playing with less confidence and has been far more subdued in an attacking sense. \n Decline in Cancelo's shooting stats \n \n \n \n Season \n Shots \n MCI rank \n \n \n \n \n 2021/22 \n 81 \n 1st \n \n \n 2022/23 \n 17 \n 8th \n \n \n \n With 17 shots prior to his departure, he ranks eighth at City this term, and he has claimed only a single assist. \n The champions have adjusted their approach to suit  Erling Haaland  this season and there has been less emphasis on full-backs flying forward. \n As a full-back who was perhaps utilised more for his attacking enterprise than his defensive skills, Cancelo's dip in productivity may have influenced Guardiola's outlook on the player. \n Out of possession, he has also had some indifferent performances, including the moment he allowed  Mohamed Salah  to beat him for the decisive goal in  Liverpool's 1-0 win  at Anfield. \n \n \n Guardiola and Klopp\u2019s reactions to *that*  @MoSalah  goal \ud83d\ude31  pic.twitter.com/SSIPqi6B8W \n\u2014 Premier League (@premierleague)  October 19, 2022 \n \n Opponents have dribbled past Cancelo nine times this season, more than any other Man City defender. \n Most dribbled-past City defenders \n \n \n \n Defender \n Dribbles \n Mins played \n \n \n \n \n Cancelo \n 9 \n 1,278 \n \n \n Walker \n 5 \n 705 \n \n \n Akanji \n 4 \n 1,197 \n \n \n Ake \n 3 \n 1,066 \n \n \n Stones \n 1 \n 1,181 \n \n \n Lewis \n 1 \n 363 \n \n \n Gomez \n 1 \n 106 \n \n \n Dias \n 0 \n 873 \n \n \n Laporte \n 0 \n 375 \n \n \n \n Ake has become City's most consistent defender. \n Impressive at both centre-back and left-back, his emergence as one of Guardiola's most trusted players has prompted the manager to alter the make-up of his rearguard. \n City build from the back in a 3-2-5 framework, so Guardiola likes one of his full-backs to be comfortable sliding across to act as a third central defender. \n Last season  Kyle Walker  performed that role from right-back, freeing up left-back Cancelo to take up central midfield positions. \n Netherlands international Ake has been preferred for that hybrid role this term. He adds useful balance with his left foot, especially with  Aymeric Laporte  making just four Premier League starts.\u00a0 \n Ake is not only defensively sound, he is also a terrific progressive passer, making more forward passes into midfield than any other City defender. \n This has carried favour with Guardiola. \n Most forward passes for City defenders \n \n \n \n Defender \n Forward passes \n Defender \n Forward passes/90 \n \n \n \n \n Ake \n 438 \n Ake \n 37.0 \n \n \n Rodri \n 345 \n Dias \n 34.5 \n \n \n Dias \n 335 \n Akanji \n 23.3 \n \n \n Akanji \n 310 \n Cancelo \n 21.3 \n \n \n Cancelo \n 303 \n Rodri \n 18.8 \n \n \n \n Guardiola recently described 18-year-old Lewis as his \"little Philipp Lahm\", the Bayern Munich full-back he coached into becoming a central midfielder. This was high praise indeed. \n Lewis caught Guardiola\u2019s eye among a group of academy players invited to join City\u2019s summer tour of the US. \n \u201cThe good players you realise in two minutes,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cWe saw it from day one in the USA, in the training sessions where [I thought], \u2018Oh, this guy has something special.\u2019\u201d \n Lewis is tactically bright, naturally sliding infield from his right-back berth to take up positions in central midfield.\u00a0 \n He is also technically outstanding, boasting a 93.4 per cent pass accuracy. He is always willing to receive passes in tight areas and is\u00a0superb at moving it on quickly to team-mates. \n In another significant shift from Guardiola, Lewis has been preferred to Walker in recent weeks. \n Using Walker and Ake at full-back in the same XI provides a slight imbalance, so from a tactical perspective Lewis's inclusion makes sense. \n Changing times \n It has been a strange season for City's defence, with Guardiola trialling several different units and configurations. \n An injury to  John Stones  should mean that  Ruben Dias  and Laporte get more game time, but very few players will feel they are certain of a starting berth. \n \n \n \n \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 0 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n At face value, Cancelo's unexpected departure weakens City but Guardiola's faith in Ake and Lewis has clearly convinced him it is time for a defensive reshuffle. \n The pair will be eager to continue repaying that trust when they face  Tottenham Hotspur  on Sunday. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 How Ouattara can add creative flair to Cherries Part 3:\u00a0 How Fernandez will unlock Chelsea's attacking potential Part 4:  How Dyche's direct approach can guide Everton to safety Part 5:  McKennie can form a perfect pairing with Adams \n",

Arsenal were battered and bruised throughout, made dizzy by the sheer variety of Man City strengths, from  Kevin De Bruyne \u2019s and  Erling Haaland \u2019s drives through the heart of midfield to the long bouts of suffocating possession.\u00a0 \n See:  Guardiola hails connection between De Bruyne and Haaland \n By the final whistle it felt like a lot more than three points gained on the leaders. Instead, it felt as though  Pep Guardiola \u2019s side were already top of the league and out of sight, such was the gulf in class. \n How quickly things can change in football. At the beginning of April, Arsenal were eight points clear at the top, a distance they had held throughout the FIFA World Cup 2022 break and beyond. Three weeks later, Opta now put Man City\u2019s chances of winning the league at 91 per cent.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n The title race \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Position \n Pos \n \n Club \n \n Played \n Pl \n \n GD \n \n Points \n Pts \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Manchester City \n MCI \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +61\n\n \n 89 \n \n \n \n 2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Arsenal \n ARS \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +45\n\n \n 84 \n \n \n \n \n \n View More \n \n All of a sudden Arsenal look brittle, their title hopes collapsing in the blink of an eye. They have now gone four matches without victory in the Premier League and need to win all of their remaining five to stand any chance of ending a 19-year wait to lift the trophy. \n Even if they win all five, Arsenal would need Man City to drop five points \u2013 as many as the champions have across their last 11 matches. \u00a0 \n See:\u00a0 Arteta: We're not going to give up \n Realistically, attention should turn to an assessment of Arsenal\u2019s season as runners-up. It would undoubtedly be a phenomenal success relative to expectations back in August, but after collecting 50 points from the first 19 matches their run since \u2013 25 points from 14, or 1.79 per match \u2013 is, disappointingly, the same as their 2021/22 average, and will leave supporters feeling frustrated.\u00a0 \n Man City simply do not look like a team about to slip up. By extending their run to seven consecutive Premier League wins, Guardiola\u2019s side are now within 11 matches of becoming the first English side since  Manchester United  in 1999 to win the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League Treble.\u00a0 \n There is a lot of work left to do, particularly in Europe, but a fifth league title in six years is now theirs for the taking. After such an emphatic and mesmerising victory, it might even feel \u2013 to buoyant Man City fans and dejected Arsenal ones \u2013 that Guardiola has one hand firmly gripping the trophy.\u00a0 \n That\u2019s what a win like this, a performance like this, can do to a title race.

Chilwell has combined a goal and an assist with two clean sheets and four bonus points in his last five matches, earning 28 points.\u00a0 \n John Stones (MCI) \u00a35.4m The  Manchester City  defender has been moved into a central midfield role ahead of his  visit to Southampton . With his aerial threat, Stones can also take advantage of Saints\u2019 weaknesses in defending set-pieces. \n Kieran Trippier (NEW) \u00a36.1m Newcastle United \u2019s right-back sits joint-fourth with Rashford in the player standings on 168 points. Trippier  visits Brentford  on the back of a 12-point haul  against Manchester United  last weekend, combining a clean sheet and an assist with three bonus points. \n Bukayo Saka (ARS) \u00a38.6m The  Arsenal  winger has recorded two of his three double-figure hauls this season in his last four starts. Saka\u2019s other big score was in his previous meeting with his  hosts Liverpool , netting twice and collecting 15 points in Gameweek 10. \n James Maddison (LEI) \u00a38.3m A  home match against AFC Bournemouth  can help the  Leicester City  playmaker return to form. Maddison\u2019s visitors have conceded a league-high 60 shots in the box in the last four Gameweeks. \n Marcus Rashford (MUN) \u00a37.3m The  Man Utd star  is the top-scoring player in Fantasy since the season resumed, earning 106 points thanks to 11 goals and two assists in 14 appearances. Rashford has seven double-figure hauls at home in 2022/23, at least two more than any other player. \n Kaoru Mitoma (BHA) \u00a35.6m Brighton & Hove Albion 's winger  visits Tottenham Hotspur  on the back of two goals, four assists and 39 points in his last five outings. Mitoma\u2019s average of 6.7 points per start is second only to the 7.9 of  Haaland \u00a0among regular starters in 2022/23 Fantasy. \n Erling Haaland (MCI) \u00a312.0m Man City\u2019s Norwegian is back in full training ahead of their trip to Southampton. Haaland\u2019s 40 shots in the box and 22 big chances in away matches are both league-leading totals this term. \n Harry Kane (TOT) \u00a311.7m The England star is the top-scoring forward in Fantasy since the season resumed, earning 87 points thanks to 10 goals and three assists. Kane has scored in four of his previous six matches against Brighton, including a strike at the Amex Stadium earlier this term. \n Ollie Watkins (AVL) \u00a37.5m He is the most-bought forward in the Gameweek, earning over 136,000 new owners ahead of  Saturday\u2019s 11:00 BST deadline .\u00a0 \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 The Scout\u2019s FPL GW30 Ones to watch Part 2:  The Scout's FPL GW30 Differentials Part 4:  Who is the best FPL captain for Gameweek 30?

Indeed, it is the exact opposite. \n Since the start of the season Foden has found Haaland with only 12 passes, and only 17 have been delivered in the other direction. \n Instead, the duo come alive in the moments that matter. \n When opponents are stretched by a City attack, Haaland and Foden work beautifully with one another to apply the finishing touch. \n A good example was Haaland\u2019s two fabulous assists for Foden in the Manchester derby. \n \n \n A first hat-trick for  @PhilFoden  \ud83c\udfa9\ud83e\ude84 #ManCity   pic.twitter.com/bqFtUKGTU1 \n\u2014 Manchester City (@ManCity)  October 2, 2022 \n \n Remarkably, half of Foden\u2019s passes to Haaland have made a chance, and almost 30 per cent of Haaland\u2019s balls to Foden have been key passes, too. \n When they link up it often produces quality end product. \n Haaland/Foden link-up play \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n Passes \n Chances created \n Success \n \n \n \n \n Foden to Haaland \n 12 \n 6 \n 50.0% \n \n \n Haaland to Foden \n 17 \n 5 \n 29.4% \n \n \n \n Year-on-year improvement \n The departures of  Raheem Sterling  and  Gabriel Jesus  last summer increased Foden\u2019s prospects of securing regular game time and he has capitalised on that in the early weeks of the season. \n Using his ever-growing game intelligence and spatial awareness to good effect, Foden is learning how to time his runs even better than he did before. \n Foden\u2019s growing influence \n \n \n \n Season \n Mins/goal \n Conversion % \n \n \n \n \n 2018/19 \n 329.0 \n 9.1 \n \n \n 2019/20 \n 178.4 \n 19.2 \n \n \n 2020/21 \n 179.2 \n 27.3 \n \n \n 2021/22 \n 237.0 \n 22.0 \n \n \n 2022/23 \n 110.5 \n 35.3 \n \n \n \n When you study his improved conversion rate and minutes-per-goal ratio with past seasons it is clear Foden is busy making another progressive step forward. \n Liverpool know all about Foden\u2019s quality, but stopping him from impacting this high-stakes duel will not be easy. \n",

Brentford  had kept  Manchester City  at bay, giving Pinnock important clean-sheet points.\u202f\u00a0 \n \u201cWith not much time left, and your assets are subbed off, and your punts not really working out \u2026 it was a really stressful evening I should say,\u201d says Jahangirov. \n Thankfully for him, Eddie Howe decided to bring on Wilson in the 69th minute, blocking Pinnock from being subbed on for Amr\u2019s team  AZZURRI , which proved decisive. \n Never has a one-point cameo appearance been more loudly cheered. And Jahangirov's appreciation for Wilson extended well beyond his late appearance in Gameweek 38. \u00a0 \n \u201cEarly in the season he delivered well for me,\" he says. \"For the Double Gameweek 36 I captained him [to get 48 points], which really pushed me towards my goal. Because it's one thing that you play safe, and another thing to take risks. And when those risks are paying off, it\u2019s just really, really satisfying.\u201d\u00a0 \n Not a one-off \n It\u2019s tempting to think that winning Fantasy is just down to luck, but Jahangirov is no one-hit wonder, having\u00a0achieved a remarkable rank of 215th overall the previous season.\u00a0 \n Out of the former winners, only 2018/19 Fantasy champion Adam Levy can boast a better second-best finish, having  come 90th last year. \n Jahangirov is one of just under 4,000 Fantasy managers from Azerbaijan, a country where the Premier League enjoys widespread popularity.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \u201cIt's huge here,\" he says. \"[There are] a lot of fans of Premier League clubs. The biggest one is  Manchester United , of course, and then  Arsenal ,  Liverpool , some  Chelsea  fans out there. \n \"A lot of my friends are Chelsea fans. And we're following it every week, we're watching games and we'll support our teams. We even travelled to England to watch games, so it's really huge and football overall is huge in Azerbaijan. \n \"It's the favourite sport here. We might not be that good but hopefully we'll get better!\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \n Speaking of his love for FPL, Jahangirov explained:\u00a0\u201cIt's just fun.

        "summary": "The Scout's panel explain what to do ahead of Man City's tricky schedule and Blank GW12",
        "text": "\n The Scout's panel of  Fantasy Premier League  experts speak about how they plan to navigate  Manchester City 's Blank Gameweek 12. \n What the experts say \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Man City are too good right now. They have two home matches at the Etihad Stadium in Gameweeks 9 and 10, so I'll be keeping all three of my Man City players.  Joao Cancelo  (\u00a37.2m),  Kevin De Bruyne  (\u00a312.3m) and  Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.0m) might be the most expensive route into a Man City triple-up, but it's worth it.  \n De Bruyne to  Mohamed Salah  (\u00a312.9m) is my most likely transfer for Blank Gameweek 12, as Salah will provide a good captaincy option. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n Owning triple Man City right now feels very right. Sure they blank in Gameweek 12 where I will likely be bringing Salah in for De Bruyne. However, until then I want triple Man City, even with the  Liverpool fixture  in Gameweek 11. \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n Man City head into the next four Gameweeks with two tough fixtures  against Manchester United  and  Liverpool , as well as a blank. However, I don't think they are an immediate sell, since they are favourites to win any match, especially at home. \n Thereafter, managers may want to consider offloading. However, with the inevitable value tied up in Haaland, one could consider simply benching him in Blank Gameweek 12.  \n Managers on a Gameweek 9 Wildcard may want to only own Haaland and Cancelo. They could opt for Salah or  Harry Kane  (\u00a311.4m) as the second premium. \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n I have three Man City players. One is goalkeeper  Ederson  (\u00a35.5m) but it's less of an issue when it comes to Gameweek 12. I will simply be able to bench him in favour of my second goalkeeper,\u00a0 Danny Ward  (\u00a34.0m), for that week.  \n If I were Wildcarding now I would own just Cancelo and Haaland and then bring in a third player from Gameweek 13 onwards.  \n Doing this means managers do not have to worry about fielding a full XI when both Man City and  Arsenal  blank in Gameweek 12. This could be really important if they also own the likes of  Gabriel Martinelli  (\u00a36.6m) and  Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a38.1m) from the Gunners. \n Geoff Dance\u00a0( @GeoffreyDance ) \n If I still had a Wildcard to play, I would now keep it until Gameweek 13. \n This allows those managers the unique opportunity of selling Haaland for Gameweek 12 before bringing him back immediately on a Wildcard. \n Their mini-league rivals are almost certain to keep Haaland and bench him for that week, rather than sell him and buy him back. \n Playing a Gameweek 13 Wildcard gives you that chance to dead-end your team and go against Haaland's 80 per cent ownership for Man City's Blank Gameweek 12. \n Man City's final four matches before the season breaks for the FIFA World Cup are just too good to ignore and a triple-up with Cancelo, De Bruyne and Haaland is my plan. \n Ben Crabtree\u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n I think it's worth keeping Man City players for the Liverpool game and through Blank Gameweek 12. They can score well against Liverpool and there is time now to start improving your bench to ensure a good 11 for Gameweek 12. \n Nick ( @WGTA_Nick )\u00a0\u00a0 \n Haaland is a must-own, while Cancelo is proving himself to be a strong and consistent selection in defence, picking up three bonus even with no attacking returns. \n De Bruyne is an expensive option in midfield but also is rewarding owners with his excellent performances week in, week out. I don't think there is a danger of tripling up, even with an upcoming blank, which can be navigated with a couple of transfers around that time. \n Pranil Sheth ( @Lateriser12 )\u00a0 \n I do think you can consider swerving De Bruyne for Salah if you are planning to captain Salah in Gameweek 9, but I also like the idea of  Phil Foden  (\u00a38.0m) who will keep ticking over the points.\u00a0 \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 GW8 FPL stats: Haaland delivers as the record captain pick Part 2:\u00a0 GW8 Bonus points:\u00a0Saliba takes top returns Part 3:  Saturday review: Son can provide KDB and Salah solution Part 4:  Keep or sell Man City stars in FPL? \n",

Almost every other player is assigned to man-marking duties. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Before a kick has been taken the Gunners tend to stand in a horizontal line to avoid possible clusters. \n From there, they will follow their markers accordingly, while the zonal players remain fixated on defending the space. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Most Premier League clubs choose to use a mixture of zonal and man-to-man marking, with very few opting to deploy just a couple of players marking space. \n Nottingham Forest  are one of those teams who prefer to man-mark, and that set-up has caused them a few problems this season. \n Opponents tend to try and create additional chaos up against man-marking sides, and the use of blockers is especially prevalent in those scenarios. \n Falling victim to that type of situation on more than one occasion,  Steve Cooper \u2019s side have conceded five times from corners. \n Most goals conceded from corners 2022/23 \n \n \n \n Team \n Goals conceded \n \n \n \n \n AFC Bournemouth \n 9 \n \n \n Brentford \n 7 \n \n \n Nott'm Forest \n 5 \n \n \n Chelsea \n 5 \n \n \n \n AFC Bournemouth  have the weakest record when it comes to defending corner kicks, shipping nine goals. \n They also go heavy on man-marking, usually with at least six defenders asked to get tight to their opposite numbers, with the others taking up zonal positions. \n Problematically, they have lost a number of key aerial duels inside the penalty box. \n Below is an example of their defensive structure at  Fulham , prior to  Issa Diop  (circled) getting a run on  Marcos Senesi  to score in the  2-2 draw . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n It feels as though zonal marking is very much in vogue with the bulk of Premier League managers and set-piece coach specialists. \n With the division on course for a record-high number of goals from corners, it will be fascinating to see if they find new ways to keep attacking sides at bay when the Premier League resumes on Boxing Day. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Why goals from corners are heading for a record high Part 2:  How Spurs free Kane to score from corners Part 3:  How Fulham use blockers to capitalise from corners Part 4:  How Man City use short corners to feed Haaland Part 5:  Why Liverpool are the kings of the outswinging corner Part 6:  Why Arsenal are a nightmare for goalkeepers from corners \n",

        "text": "\n In a season of many surprises, the weekend of Matchweek 24 did not disappoint as the title race took further twists and turns over a period of just over 24 hours. \u202f \n Arsenal  started the day looking to return to top spot having been knocked off their perch with a  3-1 home loss to Manchester City  in midweek. \n The Gunners'  early kick-off at Aston Villa  on Saturday handed them the perfect opportunity to leapfrog  Man City  and return to pole position. \n By 14:15 GMT, however, things were looking bleak for  Mikel Arteta 's side \n Less than three days after that heartbreaking home defeat by City, which led to Arsenal relinquishing their position as league leaders for the first time since 5 November, they looked set to go further behind the champions. \n At half-time at  Aston Villa , they trailed 2-1. They needed a win but the last time they had trailed at half-time in a match outside London and gone on to claim three points was way back in 2009 at Anfield.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n They fought to be level at 2-2 with a first Premier League goal by  Oleksandr Zinchenko  as the match entered stoppage time. \n One point would have been far from satisfactory for Arteta's team, representing a fourth consecutive fixture where Arsenal had dropped points. \n A draw would also have given Man City the opportunity to go two points clear at the top when they played  Nottingham Forest  in the 15:00 kick-off. \u202f \n But the fates were about to hand Arsenal a late, late boost. \n Jorginho 's shot from the edge of the area hit the bar and bounced out. Before the January Deadline Day signing from Chelsea and his new team-mates had a chance to curse their luck, the ball hit the back of the head of ex-Arsenal goalkeeper  Emiliano Martinez  and went into the net. \n \n \n What. A. Moment.  pic.twitter.com/Pux7LZD2w4 \n\u2014 Arsenal (@Arsenal)  February 19, 2023 \n \n Arsenal were now three points ahead at the top of the live table at 14:25 GMT. And their victory was sealed soon afterwards when substitute  Gabriel Martinelli  took advantage of Martinez having gone up for a corner to tap into an empty net. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The Arsenal players and staff celebrated in style. \n They knew how important it was to have ended a three-match winless run, their longest of 2022/23, as well as building a three-point lead over Man City, who were favoured to beat Forest. \n All eyes on Man City \n Having hit won the reverse fixture in August when  Erling Haaland  scored a hat-trick in a  6-0 victory ,  Pep Guardiola 's side were looking to notch another \"double\". \n Fresh from their statement victory at title-rivals Arsenal, City were confident of making it three wins on the spin. This is a common theme of Guardiola's teams; extinguish all hope for their rivals with winning streaks in the second halves of the season. \u202f \u00a0 \n And things looked to be heading that way. By 15:41,  Bernardo Silva 's brilliant finish had put City 1-0 up and back at the top of table. They were dominating proceedings and rained shot after shot on  Keylor Navas 's goal. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Further goals would come, surely? \n Frustratingly for City, they just could not find the finishing touch. Even Haaland spurned good chances, including one from barely six yards that ballooned over the bar. \n Forest frustration for Guardiola \n Steve Cooper 's side are nothing if not resilient, and having been under intense spells of pressure, they stunned their opponents as the pendulum swung back Arsenal's way with another late twist. \n With only six minutes remaining, Forest found the same space down behind Man City's left-back that Arsenal had unsuccessfully tried to exploit 72 hours earlier. \u202f \u00a0 \n This time  Morgan Gibbs-White  whipped over a cross to the far post where substitute  Chris Wood  was in the right place to tap in his first goal for the club. \n Almost confused by the unlikely state of affairs, Guardiola went to his substitutes' bench to try to restore the lead but then had to go there again to rectify his team shape. \u202f \n Two blocked efforts from  Jack Grealish  and  Ruben Dias  were all his team could muster in the remaining time and they travelled back to Manchester having handed the advantage and a two-point lead to Arsenal, who still have a match in hand. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Less than 24 hours later, it was now Man City not Arsenal, who were nervously looking over their shoulders as their lead over  Manchester United , which had been six points in Matchweek 16, was reduced to three. \n Not that  Erik ten Hag 's Red Devils had it easy in their  3-0 win over Leicester City  at Old Trafford. \n In an uncharacteristically nervy start, Man Utd were twice indebted to goalkeeper  David De Gea  for important saves with the match at 0-0, including an incredible stop from  Kelechi Iheanacho 's 23rd-minute header. \n \n \n Clean sheet #\ufe0f\u20e31\ufe0f\u20e38\ufe0f\u20e30\ufe0f\u20e3 secured with style \ud83d\udc4c @D_DeGea  x  @RemingtonUK #MUFC  ||  #MUNLEI \n\u2014 Manchester United (@ManUtd)  February 20, 2023 \n \n But  Marcus Rashford  - who else? - stepped up to settle those nerves and normal service was resumed as Man Utd recorded a third win in four. \n Rashford's brace either side of half-time took his season's total to  24 goals in all competitions , more than he has previously managed in a single campaign. \n \n \n Never in doubt \ud83d\udd25 \u26bd\ufe0f  @MarcusRashford #MUFC  ||  #MUNLEI \n\u2014 Manchester United (@ManUtd)  February 21, 2023 \n \n The return from injury and to form of  Jadon Sancho , who swept home a sumptuous third goal to seal victory, was another positive at Old Trafford. \n \n \n \n Title race \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Position \n Pos \n \n Club \n \n Played \n Pl \n \n GD \n \n Points \n Pts \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Manchester City \n MCI \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +61\n\n \n 89 \n \n \n \n 2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Arsenal \n ARS \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +45\n\n \n 84 \n \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Manchester United \n MUN \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +15\n\n \n 75 \n \n \n \n \n \n View More \n \n United for the title? \n Although five points behind Arsenal, who have a match in hand, could the top-four's form team be serious title contenders? \n A lot of people are saying so but Ten Hag is trying to dampen the hype. \n \"We don't think about that,\" he told  Man Utd's official website , instead trying to turn focus on to the second leg of their UEFA Europa League knockout playoff round with Barcelona at Old Trafford on Thursday. \n \n \n \n \n \n LEI \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 1 \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n BOU \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 4 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 0 \n \n EVE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 0 \n \n NEW \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n 3 - 2 \n \n BOU \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n LIV \n \n \n \n \n 7 - 0 \n \n MUN \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Arsenal can restore the gap to five points\u00a0 if they beat Leicester on Saturday and Man City lose at  AFC Bournemouth . \n Third-placed Man Utd are not in league action as they concentrate on Sunday's EFL Cup final with  Newcastle United . \n The following weekend will tell us more about Man Utd's title hopes as they face Liverpool at Anfield after Man City and fifth-placed Newcastle meet in the first fixture of the Matchweek. \n With plenty of points still to play for, there is sure to be more twists and turns in this most enthralling of title races. \n",

A repeat of his brace last season at the Etihad Stadium would take Kane to the milestone.\u00a0 \n History on Spurs' side \n The north Londoners can head to Manchester with the knowledge that they have dominated this contest over the past few seasons, winning four of their last five matches against  Man City , including both meetings last term. \n It represents a return of Spurs\u2019 supremacy over the Citizens between 2004 and 2010, when they triumphed in all but one of 13 meetings in all competitions. \n However, City have won this encounter convincingly on several occasions, most notably earning a  6-0 home win in November 2013 . \n Defensive frailties \n Both sides have been struggling at the back this season.\u00a0Spurs have only secured one clean sheet in their last nine outings,\u00a0a  4-0 win against Crystal Palace . \n Indeed, in the eight matches when they have conceded,  Antonio Conte 's side have let in two or more goals, taking only seven points from those outings.\u00a0 \n Meanwhile, Man City have only one clean sheet in their last six matches. \n Their frailties at the back could make this another brilliant encounter, and history suggests there will be goals.\u00a0The last goalless draw between the two teams was back in August 2010. \n Return of key personnel \n Both teams are set to be boosted by the return of key players.\u00a0 \n John Stones  has missed City's last two matches in all competitions, while  Ruben Dias  hasn't featured since being injured for Portugal at the World Cup. But Guardiola has confirmed both are in contention for this match. \n \"In the last two training sessions they have trained really well and they are in contention,\" he said on the  club's official website .\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n Rodrigo Bentancur  was also injured at the World Cup and hasn't played since. But Conte has issued a positive statement on the defensive midfielder. \n \"He is available and he could be available for the game against City,\" Conte said on the  club's official website . \n Guardiola v Conte \n A key factor for Spurs could be Conte's excellent record against Guardiola.\u00a0The Italian has won three of their last five meetings in all competitions. \n Among the managers Guardiola has faced at least five times in his career, Conte is the only one he's lost more than half his matches against. \n City can put the pressure on \n If Man City want to claim a third straight league title, they have a lot of work to do to catch Arsenal. \n However, by the time the Gunners  kick off against Manchester United  this weekend, the landscape at the top of the table could look very different. \n Should Man City win tonight, and then  at home against Wolverhampton Wanderers  at 14:00 GMT on Sunday, they would move within two points of Arsenal before the leaders start their match at 16:30 GMT. \n \n \n \n The top five \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Position \n Pos \n \n Club \n \n Played \n Pl \n \n GD \n \n Points \n Pts \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Manchester City \n MCI \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +61\n\n \n 89 \n \n \n \n 2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Arsenal \n ARS \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +45\n\n \n 84 \n \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Manchester United \n MUN \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +15\n\n \n 75 \n \n \n \n 4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Newcastle United \n NEW \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +35\n\n \n 71 \n \n \n \n 5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Liverpool \n LIV \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +28\n\n \n 67 \n \n \n \n \n \n View More \n \n \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at key tactical points and players who can be decisive in Matchweek 1. \n Jack Grealish (MCI) \n Adjusting to  Pep Guardiola\u2019 s unique tactical demands can take time, as  Manchester City \u2019s Grealish discovered during a challenging debut campaign last season. \n \n \n \n \n \n WHU \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 2 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Producing a return of three goals and three assists, compared with six and 10 respectively in his final season at  Aston Villa , Grealish will be targeting a better end product this campaign. \n Team-mates  Rodri  and  Riyad Mahrez  both made huge strides since getting off to slow starts for City, and there is optimism Grealish can be a star turn playing alongside new striker  Erling Haaland . \n Favourite opponents\u00a0 \n City\u2019s opening weekend match at  West Ham United , provides the 26-year-old with a great opportunity to shine. \n Grealish has scored on all three of his visits to London Stadium, netting a trio of excellent individual goals.\u00a0In the penultimate match of 2021/22, he drilled a fiercely struck volley past  Lukasz Fabianski  during a crucial  2-2 comeback draw . \n Grealish's MW37 goal v West Ham \n \n \n A big goal in the title race! \ud83d\udcaaWe kick off 2022/23 with a repeat of our final away game in 21/22 \ud83d\udc4a #ManCity   pic.twitter.com/JHpcANN5xE \n\u2014 Manchester City (@ManCity)  June 16, 2022 \n \n While at Villa, he also scored memorable solo goals at West Ham in the previous two seasons. \n With Grealish so confident in his surroundings and eager to make a big impression, he is a man to watch this Sunday. \u00a0 \n PL chances created 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Chances created/90\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n De Bruyne \n 2.83 \n \n \n Grealish \n 2.44 \n \n \n Fernandes \n 2.16 \n \n \n Odegaard, Buendia \n 2.13 \n \n \n \n Grealish only supplied three Premier League assists in 2021/22, but in open play he was statistically the second-most creative player, narrowly behind  Kevin De Bruyne . \n Laying on 2.44 chances per 90 minutes, he played his part for the champions. \n Darting in from the left, he encountered more deep-lying blocks than he was used to facing at Villa.\u00a0He successfully pushed defenders back with the ball, enjoying the fifth-most touches inside the opposition box. \n However, Grealish was not always able to fashion clear-cut chances or shots from those advanced positions.\u00a0He ranked outside the top 50 for big chances created and total shots per 90. \n Grealish's contribution 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Grealish \n Total/90 \n Rank \n \n \n \n \n Touches in opp. box \n 8.03 \n 5th \n \n \n Big chances created \n 0.23 \n 51st \n \n \n Shots \n 2.11 \n 54th \n \n \n \n The Haaland factor \n With his pace, movement and finishing prowess, Haaland will provide City with a fantastic new dimension against West Ham. \n Their attacking midfielders should have more through-ball opportunities, courtesy of Haaland's desire to make runs in behind the last defender. \n Grealish assists Haaland's first City goal \n \n \n That first goal feeling! \ud83e\udd29 #ManCity   pic.twitter.com/qQOSVThvoR \n\u2014 Manchester City (@ManCity)  July 24, 2022 \n \n Haaland's elite predatory instincts will also encourage City\u2019s players to put more balls into the area than when deploying a \"false nine\" striker. \n With this in mind, Grealish could quickly become a key component in City\u2019s tactical evolution.\u00a0He can deliver the kind of service that will help a striker of Haaland\u2019s style flourish. \n West Ham must apply as much pressure as they can to Grealish whenever he gets on the ball, to stop him creating chances for Haaland. \n Big season ahead \n While Grealish will have been frustrated not to supply more goals and assists, the stats suggest he was unfortunate not to enjoy a higher output. \n According to Opta\u2019s xA (Expected assists) and xG (Expected goals) the quality of chances he made, or had to score, should have resulted in more goals. \n \u00a0Grealish expected assist/goals \n \n \n \n 2021/22 \n Per 90\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n Expected assists \n 0.21 \n \n \n Assists \n 0.14 \n \n \n Expected goals \n 0.28 \n \n \n Goals \n 0.14 \n \n \n \n This is a big season for Grealish and with  Raheem Sterling  and  Gabriel Jesus  moving on this summer he should enjoy more match time for Guardiola. \n If his relationship with Haaland clicks at West Ham, it has potential to pave the way for a special season-long connection. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  Saliba ready to tackle Palace attack Part 3:  Robertson's attacking prowess could unlock Fulham Part 4:  Man Utd must be alert to Trossard threat \n",

If you have Liverpool players, hold them for the  AFC Bournemouth fixture  and maybe consider selling for Blank Gameweek 28, if you can't field a full team.  \n I wouldn't recommend targeting Liverpool unless you are Free-Hitting in Gameweek 28 and are already prepared for Gameweek 27 with plenty of  Brighton & Hove Albion  and  Brentford  players. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @Zophar666 ) \n I wouldn't buy any Liverpool players this week unless you are Free-Hitting in Gameweek 28, as they blank next week. Plus a lot of teams have good match-ups in Gameweek 27. Their Double in Gameweek 29 isn't the greatest, either, with away matches  against Man City  and  Chelsea .  \n If you already own, I would definitely stick with them this week, though, as AFC Bournemouth is a great fixture. \n Lee Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n If you've got them, definitely hold for the AFC Bournemouth fixture. If you can, bench them next week in BGW28, so you can bring them back in for their DGW29.  \n If you're planning a Free Hit in BGW28, now is a good time to jump in and gain an advantage over those that will ignore them because of that blank. \n Nick Harris ( @WGTA_Nick ) \n I'm going slightly against the grain going into this week with two Liverpool players. However, I can see them dominating against AFC Bournemouth and will be full of confidence after last week's win. I plan on Free-Hitting for BGW28, though.\u00a0 \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n If you own Liverpool players, hold them. However, with their blank in GW28, I would only be buying them if I had committed to a Free Hit that week. \n Remember, the Gameweek 27 deadline is at 11:00 GMT on Saturday 11 March \n",

Toney  has 25 points, returning eight, nine and eight points across the opening three Gameweeks. Toney now  faces Everton  in Gameweek 4.

But I have been impressed by the starts from  Wilfried Zaha  (\u00a37.0m) and  Mitrovic , who defences have really struggled to contain, and can see both racking up plenty of goals. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n I'm impressed with how  Toney  has started the season. He did well last year but looks to have improved, helping Brentford to be an attacking threat. The fixtures are good for him so I expect goals and assists to continue. \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n Gabriel Martinelli  (\u00a36.4m) looks set to continue his early-season form. He's undroppable given his current level of returns.

        "text": "\n It\u2019s not often a crowd stays behind to salute their team following a painful stoppage-time defeat but that\u2019s what happened at Emirates Stadium on New Year\u2019s Day 2022. \n Arsenal  had just lost to  Manchester City  for the tenth time in a row but for an hour  Mikel Arteta \u2019s side had gone toe-to-toe with the reigning champions and been the better team. \n Our football was fast and slick, we looked like a well-organised unit from front to back and more than deserved the half-time lead given to us by  Bukayo Saka . \n Defeat in the last minutes, preceded by an avoidable red card and a soft penalty was hard to accept, but after a difficult few years, there was cause for optimism. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n The gap between Arsenal and the best team in England - cavernous at the start of the campaign - had closed a little. \n Fast forward 15 months and the Gunners\u2019 progress has been nothing short of astonishing. In many respects, it\u2019s caught supporters completely off-guard. \n \n \n \n The title race \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Position \n Pos \n \n Club \n \n Played \n Pl \n \n GD \n \n Points \n Pts \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Manchester City \n MCI \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +61\n\n \n 89 \n \n \n \n 2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Arsenal \n ARS \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +45\n\n \n 84 \n \n \n \n \n \n View More \n \n None of us expected to be challenging for the title this year and if you\u2019d suggested as much last summer, we wouldn't have believed you. \n Sure, we made canny signings who added experience to a youthful side brimming with vim and vigour, but the ambition, having stumbled at the final hurdle last season, was always a top-four finish and the end of our UEFA Champions League exodus. \n While Friday\u2019s  3-3 draw against Southampton  was not the result anyone of an Arsenal persuasion expected or wanted, it does mean we\u2019ve secured a place at Europe\u2019s top table with six matches to go. \n It\u2019s a monumental achievement. That there\u2019s an even bigger prize still on the table, despite the recent wobble, is exhilarating and terrifying in equal measure. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n To get to this point, Arteta has improved Arsenal in every department. After three consecutive years struggling to create and take chances, we\u2019ve already hit 77 goals for the campaign; a figure that outstrips the tally hit by  Arsene Wenger \u2019s Invincibles. \n \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 1 \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n What\u2019s more, we\u2019ve not been reliant on a solitary talisman. Scoring goals has been a collective effort.  Gabriel Jesus  set the standards in the opening months, wingers Saka and  Gabriel Martinelli  took up the baton and the supporting cast have all chipped in with vital contributions. \n A fluid formation has helped release our attacking potential. In particular, the deployment of  Oleksandr Zinchenko  as an inverted left-back with a licence to roam in midfield. His probing has freed  Granit Xhaka , reborn in a more advanced position, to bomb forward and create space for the talismanic  Martin Odegaard  to pull the strings in the final third. \n With an extra body higher up the pitch, we\u2019ve become much more adept at pressing high and turning over possession in dangerous areas. \n Thomas Partey \u2019s athleticism and the aggression of  William Saliba ,  Gabriel Magalhaes  and  Ben White  mean we\u2019re constantly squeezing the pitch. Behind them,  Aaron Ramsdale  continues to grow in stature, making telling contributions with a consistency that belies his age. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Relentless, physical, dynamic, and adventurous; Arsenal have been magnificent to watch this season. Throw in a series of dramatic last-gasp wins at home and away and we\u2019ve made memories to last a lifetime. \n In that context, it feels greedy demanding more but that\u2019s what football fans do, isn\u2019t it? \n Once vague dreams come into focus, expectations reset and you persuade yourself the impossible is possible. We\u2019ve topped the table for so long, to let it slip now won\u2019t be anything other than gut-wrenching. \n Of course, in City, we couldn\u2019t have a more formidable opponent.  Pep Guardiola \u2019s tactical tinkering has breathed new life into them recently,  Erling Haaland  looks irrepressible and they have a psychological edge after beating us twice in the last four months. That Arteta, in all likelihood, won\u2019t be able to field his preferred starting XI is also a serious concern. \n The smart money isn\u2019t on Arsenal. But then, it hasn\u2019t been all season. So maybe, just maybe, we can upset the odds again, assert ourselves on the match and sneak away with a result that keeps us in the driving seat heading into the final month. \n Whatever happens on Wednesday, that gap between us and City continues to close. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Andrew Allen is deputy editor of  Arseblog news  and the Editor of the  The Arsenal Collective \n Also in this series \n Man City v Arsenal - Everything you need to know \n",

We are still at the start to restore Manchester United back to where we belong, that is winning trophies. This is the first one.\" \n There have been contrasting fortunes for previous Man Utd managers whose first piece of silverware was a domestic cup. \n Ferguson, who was invited back into the Man Utd dressing room to share his experience with the players, lifted the FA Cup in 1990 before going on to enjoy an incredible career at Old Trafford, winning a staggering 38 trophies. \n \n \n We can't get enough of this footage \ud83e\udd70 #MUFC  ||  #CarabaoCup \n\u2014 Manchester United (@ManUtd)  February 27, 2023 \n \n By contrast, while  Jose Mourinho  also secured an EFL Cup success in 2017 and added the Europa League later that season, his reign turned sour and came to an end in December 2018. \n Experienced stars instrumental \n The winning mentality of  Casemiro ,  Raphael Varane  and  David De Gea  proved crucial at Wembley Stadium on Sunday as Man Utd steadied the ship following Newcastle's bright start. \n Playing his first domestic match since 4 February after serving a three-match ban, Casemiro headed in the opening goal and provided authority in central midfield. \n Remarkably, the Brazilian has now been victorious in each of his last nine major finals, winning four UEFA Champions Leagues, three FIFA Club World Cups, one Copa del Rey and one EFL Cup. \n \n \n \ud83c\udf1f  @Casemiro  is the definition of a big game player. #MUFC  ||  #CarabaoCup \n\u2014 Manchester United (@ManUtd)  February 27, 2023 \n \n Varane and De Gea also provided the on-pitch leadership that is so important in high-pressure matches. \n \u201cRapha Varane, Casemiro, David De Gea, they know how to win trophies,\u201d explained Ten Hag. \u201cYou need such lads on the pitch to point the team, coach the team, organise the team, not only from a tactical perspective but also especially the mental perspective. It's so important, the winning attitude. \n \u201cThey have to bring it in the dressing room and bring it to the team. In difficult situations, they have to handle it and that's what they did again.\" \n Newcastle need to fix goalscoring woes \n As for Newcastle, they succumbed to a third straight 2-0 defeat in Wembley finals. \n But the mood among fans is that under  Eddie Howe  and with their new owners, they won\u2019t have to wait another 24 years to reach another domestic cup final, having previously appeared at Wembley in the 1999 FA Cup final.\u00a0 \n Addressing his side\u2019s lack of goals will be at the forefront of Howe\u2019s mind. In their last 12 matches across all competitions, Newcastle have only scored nine goals. \n \u201cThe team is playing well but we're not as free-scoring right now,\u201d said Howe. \u201cThat's a challenge.

However, we saw fewer postponed fixtures than we were expecting because of the FA Cup results. I am still unsure if I will now target Blank GW32 or a Double Gameweek later in the season. \n Nick Harris ( @WGTA_Nick ) \n I plan on playing the Free Hit chip during the Double Gameweek. For GW28, I intend to just navigate through it. If you are heavily short on players though, this may be a good opportunity to use it.\u00a0 \n Lee Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n If you can only field six to eight players in GW28, it's definitely worth considering using the Free Hit chip. Nine and above, then I'd save it to help you navigate through future Blank and Double Gameweeks. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @Zophar666 ) \n The Free Hit strategy is quite team dependent. If you have just five or six players then this is a viable option, but if you can get up to nine with a hit or two, I would consider saving it for Blank GW32. \n Ben Crabtree\u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n This will be the best week to play it and it suits my team to.  There are players I like for a one-week punt here but wouldn't want to transfer in. \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n If you can get 10 or more players out in GW28 then I would hold the Free Hit.

        "text": "\n We look at the key lessons from the midweek EFL Cup quarter-finals, ahead of the next Premier League matches. \u00a0 \n One-sided derby less likely \n There was a chasm between the Manchester rivals when they  last met in October , with Man City going 6-1 up before their visitors hit two late consolation goals. But the landscape has since shifted. \n City have not won two of their last four matches in all competitions, with those slip-ups coming against two sides who sit in the Premier League relegation zone. \n After the  1-1 draw at home against Everton  on New Year's Eve, City lost 2-0 at Southampton in the EFL Cup on Wednesday night. \n Pep Guardiola  introduced  Kevin De Bruyne  and  Erling Haaland  in the second half but neither player could make an impact. \n Haaland has now failed to score in his last two matches, for the first time this season. \n It is looking like a good time to face the champions. However, on the three previous occasions when they have lost this season in all competitions, City have gone on to win their next match. \n \n \n \n \n \n MUN \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 1 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n In-form stars are on Man Utd\u2019s side \n By contrast, Man Utd head into the derby in red-hot form, having won their last eight matches in all competitions, their best run for four years. \n At home, they have won their last nine, with the latest victory being Tuesday's 3-0 EFL Cup triumph over Charlton Athletic. \n Their free-scoring form is highlighted by the fact they have scored three goals in four of their last five matches. \n Marcus Rashford  is leading the way, scoring in each of his last six outings. In the midweek cup tie, he only needed half an hour as a substitute to strike twice. \n Having scored in his last eight home matches, he will relish the visit from Man City and back himself to end his five-match run without a goal against the Citizens in the Premier League. He has only had one shot on target across those derbies. \n City must also watch out for  Antony , who has hit form himself by scoring in his last two matches. \n The Brazilian struck with a long-range curling strike in the reverse fixture at the Etihad Stadium and, ominously for Guardiola's side, he scored a very similar goal against Charlton. \n \n \n \ud83d\udcab Simply stunning.

I've even had non-League managers calling me out saying I'm not good enough. \n \n \n \n \n \n EVE \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 2 \n \n SOU \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n \"It's a proud moment for me.

Newcastle have had 12 different scorers in the Premier League, the most in the competition. \n And on Tuesday,  Dan Burn  joined the list of players to find the net this season, scoring his first goal for his boyhood club in the 2-0 EFL Cup win over  Leicester City . \n \n \n Living the dream. \u2764\ufe0f What a way to score your first goal for your boyhood club! \ud83d\ude4c  pic.twitter.com/WQaeYFvKy3 \n\u2014 Newcastle United FC (@NUFC)  January 11, 2023 \n \n Semi-finalists face busy schedules \n While Man Utd are used to battling on a number of fronts, it is a rarer challenge for Newcastle, Southampton and  Nottingham Forest  in the second half of the season. \n All four clubs have plenty to play for in the Premier League, but the two-legged EFL Cup semi-finals will test their fitness, the depth of their squads and their managers' views on rotation. \n Furthermore, whoever qualify for the final on 26 February will have their Matchweek 25 fixtures postponed to a later date.\u00a0 \n Fixtures for semi-finalists \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n MUN \n NEW \n NFO \n SOU \n \n \n \n \n MW20 \n MCI (H) \n FUL (H) \n LEI (H) \n EVE (A) \n \n \n CRY (A) \n \n \n MW21 \n ARS (A) \n CRY (A) \n BOU (A) \n AVL (H) \n \n \n EFL \n NFO (A) \n SOU (A) \n MUN (H) \n NEW (H) \n \n \n FAC \n RDG (H) \n - \n - \n BLP (H) \n \n \n EFL \n NFO (H) \n SOU (H) \n MUN (A) \n NEW (A) \n \n \n MW22 \n CRY (H) \n WHU (H) \n LEE (H) \n BRE (A) \n \n \n MW25 \n BRE (H) \n BHA (H) \n WHU (A) \n LEE (A) \n \n \n \n",

He showed again why he's first choice, and having removed  Gabriel Martinelli  (\u00a36.6m) for Double Gameweek 29, I now have an Arsenal slot to fill and I'm keen to do so with Jesus. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @Zophar666 ) \n Jesus'  return to fitness makes Arsenal even better, but it could also mean points being spread more.  Bukayo Saka  (\u00a38.6m)\u00a0 is the still the main man, though. His benching against Leeds was down to illness, and not rotation, so managers should keep the faith. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n Big chances have always fallen \u00a0Jesus ' way, which is why he's always been a good option in FPL, even when his finishing has been below par. However, the Arsenal midfielders provide exceptional value so I can't see myself owning Jesus, when  Martin Odegaard  (\u00a36.8m) and  Martinelli  are considerably cheaper. \n Nick Harris ( @WGTA_Nick ) \n Jesus  is certainly another option. As a  Saka  and  Martinelli  owner, I do worry that the latter could be the victim of more rotation and might be the one to drop out of the side. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n Jesus  is one to monitor ahead of a couple of tricky away matches. Fully fit, he's great to own, but even if I didn't have any other fires to put out, I'd rather roll a transfer this week than get him in just yet. \n Pranil Sheith ( @lateriser12 ) \n The presence of  Jesus  makes Arsenal a much better team and he could be a handy differential in Blank Gameweek 32. I'm not too worried about it affecting \u00a0Saka 's minutes, as he plays when fit. \n Sam Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n I was really impressed by  Jesus  in DGW29. His performance was one of a man fully fit and not one just returning from injury.\u00a0 \n Jamie Pigott ( @Futbolislifefpl ) \n Jesus  back into the fold is interesting, but I don't expect it to be impactful to our FPL teams. Arsenal's upcoming fixtures are difficult except for BGW32, when a lot of Fantasy managers plan to Free Hit. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  How Jesus' return could impact Arsenal midfielders in FPL Part 3:  Pairing Haaland with Grealish can bring huge returns in FPL \n",

His scoring record has been phenomenal, yet few managers own him after his recent return to the side. \n Lateriser ( @lateriser12 ) \n If you count  Eddie Nketiah  (\u00a36.8m) as a differential, he's the one with the highest ceiling among  Arsenal  attackers given his underlying numbers. The bulk of those chances in that team are falling to him.  \n Outside of that, I really fancy  Joao Felix  (\u00a37.5m) for the upcoming run. He looked great in his cameo against  Fulham  while  Chelsea  have a confirmed fixture in Gameweek 25 and 28. \n Lee Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n Maddison  looks set to be the main beneficiary of  Mateus Tete 's (\u00a35.5m) move to  Leicester City . As an out-and-out winger, Tete's arrival means that Maddison can play more centrally and closer to the strikers - a position in which we've seen him do well in previously in FPL.  \n Spurs showed more defensive resilience against  Manchester City , but prior to that they had looked a little leaky defensively. \n Ben Crabtree\u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n With Leicester leaky at the back and Spurs suited to the counter, I think  Dejan Kulusevski  (\u00a38.0m) could do well this week. \n Sam Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n Newcastle United 's  Callum Wilson  (\u00a37.1m) has returned in all of his last six outings against newly-promoted teams in the Premier League.  \n In those matches, he has averaged six points-per-match. Wilson faces his former club  AFC Bournemouth  in Gameweek 23 and is owned by just 4.4 per cent of managers.  \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n Jack Grealish  (\u00a36.8m) was Man City's brightest player last time out and with one of his two fixtures against boyhood club  Aston Villa , the narrative is there for him.  \n Owned by less than two per cent owned and only \u00a36.8m, I think he could be a really nice option if you don't already own three City players.  \n Pras ( @Pras_FPL ) \n My No 1 differential going into the Double is  Nketiah . Despite some interest last Gameweek, he remains just 10.3 per cent owned.  \n He looks good to play the bulk of the minutes, as  Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a37.9m) is still some way off returning from injury. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 DGW23 Scout Selection Part 2:\u00a0 DGW23 Captains \n",

If they're to continue improving, then moving  James Ward-Prowse  (\u00a36.2m) into a more advanced No 10 role is surely something that the manager will keep doing. Plus, we know how deadly he can be from set-pieces.\u00a0 \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @Zophar666 ) \n No team has scored more goals since the restart than  Brighton & Hove Albion  and  Kaoru Mitoma  (\u00a35.0m) is a great differential pick owned by under two per cent of the game. He's only \u00a35.0m and a great replacement for either  Miguel Almiron  (\u00a35.9m) or  Andreas Pereira  (\u00a34.6m). \n Sam Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n Che Adams  (\u00a36.3m) has a goal and three assists in five matches under head coach Jones. He is averaging 5.2 points-per-match since Gameweek 16, up from 3.2 points in the opening 15 Gameweeks.  \n His eight shots in the box since Gameweek 16 is team-leading, while Adams has had three big chances, the same as  Ward-Prowse . Opponents  Aston Villa  have conceded 14 big chances in the last four Gameweeks, the second most in the league. I expect Adams to get some good opportunities this weekend. \n Ben Crabtree\u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n Brighton are looking great, so they're the perfect place to look for differentials. I'm backing the exciting \u00a0Mitoma  to continue to pick up returns. \n Nick Harris ( @WGTA_Nick )\u00a0 \n The best differential for me this weekend would be  Dejan Kulusevski  (\u00a37.9m). Spurs have been patchy of late but when he plays they look a lot better. He may be the catalyst to a return to form. His goal against Man City on Thursday could be a sign of things to come for Kulusevski and Spurs.\u00a0 \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n Wilfried Gnonto  (\u00a35.0m) was starting to catch the eye in a  Leeds United  shirt before the FIFA World Cup 2022 with some good cameos. However, now he's a starter for Jesse Marsch, and he's high on my watchlist.  \n Gnonto offers really good goal threat in a team I always back to score. At 0.4 per cent owned and only \u00a35.0m, I'm keen to make him my third forward if this form continues. \n Pras ( @Pras_FPL ) \n Most differentials come for Brighton given how attacking they have been. Both \u00a0Mitoma  and  Solly March  (\u00a35.1m) feel like great differential picks. But they won't be differentials for long! \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 GW21 Scout Selection Part 2:\u00a0 GW21 Captains \n",

For that reason I think you may get better value out of  Dejan Kulusevski  (\u00a38.1m) as the cheaper option outside of  Harry Kane  (\u00a311.4m) and  Son Heung-min  (\u00a312.0m), which justified my reason for taking Kane out for  Erling Haaland  (\u00a311.6m).\u00a0 \n \n \n \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea The goal his performance deserved \ud83d\udd25  pic.twitter.com/Yc6eh6g9sa \n\u2014 Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial)  August 6, 2022 \n \n Pranil Sheth ( @lateriser12 ) \n I'm convinced  Darwin Nunez  (\u00a39.0m) is the biggest template buster in the game at the moment and one who could change the  Liverpool  dynamic and team structure. I am very bullish on him and don't think it will be long before he's a must-have. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n With Nunez in mind, I left my third Liverpool slot open and I have no doubt he will be in my team soon. He changes the way they play and big chances seems to fall his way. \n \n \n \n Pras ( @Pras_fpl ) \n What the Spurs performance told me is that maybe this year we may see a few more goals shared around, in addition to the Kane and Son combination. \n Kulusevski impressed and is putting his hand up as the go-to \u00a38.0m midfielder. I see him as competition to similarly-priced players, rather than Son or Kane. I am also looking forward to seeing how  Richarlison  (\u00a38.5m) fits into the attack after he returns from suspension and whose minutes he eats up, even if coming on as a substitute. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n The third Liverpool spot will give managers headaches as it will require two transfers to switch through the positions. As long as  Diogo Jota  (\u00a39.0m) is out, Nunez looks a great pick at \u00a39.0m. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n It won't be long before Nunez moves from an \"impact\" player for Jurgen Klopp and into the starting XI.

With doubts over  Haaland 's minutes ahead of the UEFA Champions League and FA Cup finals, I will likely hand my armband elsewhere. \n Harry Kane  (\u00a311.5m) has returned in all of his last six matches for  Tottenham Hotspur  and he faces a  Leeds United  side who will likely deploy a high line in their quest for the victory they need to have any chance of securing Premier League safety. A high line is something Kane and  Son Heung-min\u00a0 (\u00a311.5m) are experts in breaking down. With penalties too and a being bonus point magnet, Kane will likely be my pick.\u00a0 \n Nick Harris ( @WGTA_Nick ) \n Haaland  and \u00a0Salah  will be the most captained as always, but defenders have done well in the past in Gameweek 38.  Trent Alexander-Arnold  (\u00a37.8m) could be an excellent alternative pick against bottom side  Southampton . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @Zophar666 ) \n Eberechi Eze  (\u00a35.7m) has been on fire since Roy Hodgson took charge.

        "text": "\n The Scout's panel of  Fantasy Premier League  experts discuss the best players to pick up in Gameweek 30 who are low owned. \n Jamie Pigott ( @Futbolislifefpl ) \n Leicester City  looked poor last time out, but  AFC Bournemouth at home  is the perfect fixture to get back on track. I like  Harvey Barnes  (\u00a36.7m) at just 2.3 per cent owned and on the back of a goal against  Aston Villa .\u00a0 \n Pras ( @Pras_FPL ) \n In midfield,  Manchester City 's  Jack Grealish  (\u00a36.9m),  Riyad Mahrez  (\u00a37.3m) or  Ilkay Gundogan  (\u00a37.3m) are all very decent differentials, not only this week but beyond. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Is  Grealish  Pep-roulette-proof ? Probably not, especially with UEFA Champions League fixtures upcoming. But he's certainly showing good form, including that 12-pointer against  Liverpool . At under five per cent-owned, he's a great differential  against Southampton . \n See:  Pairing Haaland with Grealish can bring huge returns \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @Zophar666 ) \n Alex Moreno  (\u00a34.4m) has nailed down the left-back spot at  Aston Villa  over  Lucas Digne  (\u00a34.6m) and the Spaniard has created 10 chances over the last six Gameweeks. Also no defender has more assists than his two over that period. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n Grealish  is playing his best football in a Man City shirt. He is very affordable and so low-owned I am very likely to transfer him in this Gameweek. \"Pep roulette\" is a concern but Grealish has had the left-forward role locked in for some time. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Nick Harris ( @WGTA_Nick ) \n At just over 12 per cent ownership,  Reece James  (\u00a35.8m) is still a good option to differentiate managers' teams.  Wolverhampton Wanderers  struggle to score and James also offers attacking threat so he could bring returns at both ends of the pitch.\u00a0 \n Sam Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n Grealish  is the standout differential, however, defensively I really like  Tyrone Mings  (\u00a34.4m). Mings has kept four clean sheets in his last six matches and picked up an assist and eight bonus points in the same period. Indeed, since GW25 only  Ben White\u00a0 (\u00a34.8m) has registered more returns than Mings across all defenders in the game.\u00a0 \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n Villa are on form and have a  home fixture against Nottingham Forest  who have really struggled on the road.  Emiliano Buendia  (\u00a35.7m) could be in for goals and assists. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 The Scout\u2019s FPL GW30 Ones to watch Part 2:  The Scout's FPL GW30 Differentials Part 3:\u00a0 Scout Selection: Best FPL team for Gameweek 30 Part 4:  Gameweek 30 Captains: Rashford a strong contender Part 5:  FPL experts: Who to captain in Gameweek 30 Part 7:  The Scout's best replacements for Luke Shaw in FPL \n Don't forget, the GW30 deadline is 11:00 BST on Saturday 8 April \n",

I was originally planning to bring him back in for Gameweek 30, but may delay that until Double Gameweek 34 now.\u00a0 \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n Man City players are top of my wish list, starting with  Haaland . I will then target a midfielder and defender before DGW34 so  Grealish  and  Ruben Dias  (\u00a35.9m) are likely to come in. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n If fit for GW30, I'll be bringing  Haaland  back in and spending the money I have saved in the bank specifically for that transfer. I'm keen to add to the Norwegian, possibly with  Grealish  as  Phil Foden  (\u00a38.0m) is out for a few weeks. \n Pranil Sheith ( @lateriser12 ) \n Haaland  is a case of monitor and see what happens for me. I have \u00a0Grealish  and  Ilkay Gundogan  (\u00a37.3m) on my Man City watchlist.

I think managers can take the risk and go without the Norwegian until Gameweek 33 given his blank in Gameweek 32. \n Sam Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n Thankfully, I still have  Haaland  and I am expecting him to be back for the weekend. However, I'd try to complement him with a further Man City asset.  Grealish 's 12-point haul against Liverpool has moved him to the top of my priority list.\u00a0 \n Nick Harris ( @WGTA_Nick ) \n Haaland  is the key Man City asset and it will be dangerous not owning for the next few Gameweeks. However, due to their BGW32, one City player is sufficient until GW33 and DGW34. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  How Jesus' return could impact Arsenal midfielders in FPL Part 2:  FPL experts: Is it time to bring in Jesus? \u00a0 Part 3:  Pairing Haaland with Grealish can bring huge returns in FPL \n",

Along with  Chelsea , they are one of only two sides who have a Double Gameweek 19.\u00a0 \n Make changes to your FPL squad now \n Darwin Nunez (LIV) \u00a39.0m \n Liverpool 's summer signing was in prolific form prior to the season break. \n Darwin produced five goals and an assist in his final seven outings across all competitions, blanking just twice in that run. \n Uruguay's early elimination from the FIFA World Cup 2022 lessens the likelihood of rotation, suggesting he will retain his role as the Reds' striker when domestic action returns. \n Harry Kane (TOT) \u00a311.6m \n The  Tottenham Hotspur  forward is the second top-scoring player in Fantasy, amassing 102 points in 15 appearances. \n Kane has blanked on just three of those occasions, combining 12 goals with three assists and 21 bonus points. \n Bringing in a budget enabler such as  Miguel Almiron  (\u00a35.8m) or  Rodrigo  (\u00a36.3m) in midfield could help free up funds to bring Kane in alongside  Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.2m) in managers' forward lines.\u00a0 \n Eddie Nketiah (ARS) \u00a36.5m \n Jesus' absence gives the 23-year-old the chance to offer major value as a cut-price route into the Arsenal attack. \n An ownership of only 0.3 per cent also highlights Nketiah's potential as a huge differential for Gameweek 17. \n The Gunners' short-term schedule adds to his appeal, with back-to-back encounters  with West Ham United  and  Brighton & Hove Albion  up next. \n Che Adams (SOU) \u00a36.4m \n Southampton 's kind run of upcoming opponents looks encouraging for his prospects under new first-team manager Nathan Jones. \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), five of their next seven matches score only two. \n Adams scored and earned eight points in Jones' first match at the helm  in a 3-1 defeat at Liverpool  in Gameweek 16. \n Furthermore, his totals of 29 shots, 24 shots in the box, 10 big chances and 12 shots on target are all more than any team-mate. \n",

However, I'll certainly be going for two premiums in my Gameweek 17 team, given  Mohamed Salah \u2019s (\u00a312.8m) time off and  Liverpool 's favourable fixtures. \n Nick ( @WGTA_Nick ) \n Haaland  has had a long break and I am expecting him to come back refreshed and fitter than ever. \n I expect he'll remain key to our teams, as we continue to build around him with a mixture of mid-priced players, another premium like  Salah  in midfield and cheaper enablers like  Miguel Almiron  (\u00a35.8m), who has also been well rested. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Having not played at the FIFA World Cup 2022, I can see  Haaland  and  Salah  being popular come Gameweek 17. Kane will be in the conversation but may well go deep into the tournament with England, so two premiums are probably enough for me. \n I'll balance those premiums with good budget options, like  Almiron  in midfield and  Kepa Arrizabalaga  (\u00a34.5m) in goal. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n For as long as  Haaland  is fit, he will be a set and forget. With so many good enablers in the game this season, owning three premium attacking players still feels very balanced. \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Having  Haaland  won\u2019t prevent me owning other premiums, as I'll look to own three premiums up front in Haaland,  Kane  and  Darwin Nunez  (\u00a39.0m), especially as there are so many nice budget-friendly picks in midfield. \n The likes of  Andreas Pereira  (\u00a34.6m), who has a  Double Gameweek 19 ,  Almiron  and  Dejan Kulusevski  (\u00a38.0m) all allow managers to have multiple premiums. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n Haaland  and  Salah  have both been well rested, having not featured at the World Cup, and with the emergence of value picks such as  Diogo Dalot  (\u00a34.8m),  Kieran Trippier  (\u00a35.9m),  Ben White  (\u00a34.7m) and  Pereira , it is easier than ever to get a third premium in. \n De Bruyne  or  Kane  alongside those two big-hitters is very much possible while keeping a balanced squad. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Best Newcastle picks Part 2:  Best Arsenal picks Part 3:  Best \u00a38.0m midfielders Part 5:\u00a0 Players to start considering due to World Cup \n",

Managers should only pick this option if their current squad is decimated and they are left with four or five players for Gameweek 8. \n Providing you can field between eight and 10 players without having to take a significant points deduction, a Free Hit or Triple Captain chip is best left alone for now. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Gameweek 8: What FPL managers need to know Part 3:  GW8 Ones to watch: Mitrovic to continue goal run Part 4:  GW8 Differentials: Isak has schedule to thrive Part 5:  FPL expert: Who to put in your Free Hit team \u00a0 Part 6:  FPL experts: What's the best chip for reduced GW8?

        "text": "\n After a thrilling weekend delivering drama from top to bottom in the Premier League, Alex Keble looks at the key talking points and tactical lessons. \n Arsenal feeling the pressure? \n Arsenal players must now feel the icy grip of  Manchester City  hands on their shoulders. If that seems too macabre an image, consider that City\u2019s coldly clinical run-ins are as inevitable as death and taxes. \n \n \n \n \n \n WHU \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 2 \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n In their last four title-challenging seasons, ignoring their routine stroll in 2020/21, Man City have averaged 20.3 points from their final eight matches. \n Hit that figure again and Arsenal will need 17 points \u2013 five wins, two draws \u2013 from their last seven fixtures. \n As five  Arsenal  players put their hands on their knees at the final whistle, visibly winded and gasping for breath, Sunday\u2019s post-mortem left the distinct impression that  Mikel Arteta \u2019s side will need to win at the Etihad Stadium next Wednesday, 26 April. \n But it should also note that City\u2019s infallibility is not normal, and that to hit 91 points \u2013 as Arsenal are on course to do \u2013 would be the joint-highest total in all but four of the 25 Premier League seasons prior to Man City\u2019s first title under  Pep Guardiola . \n He has created a new order, a new landscape that demands near-perfection from would-be challengers. \n \n \n \n The title race \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Position \n Pos \n \n Club \n \n Played \n Pl \n \n GD \n \n Points \n Pts \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Manchester City \n MCI \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +61\n\n \n 89 \n \n \n \n 2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Arsenal \n ARS \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +45\n\n \n 84 \n \n \n \n \n \n See the full table \n \n Maybe that is why, for the second successive Sunday, Arsenal\u2019s rhythm was undeniably shaken, their fluency interrupted. \n West Ham United  supporters will point to a surge in tenacity around the half-hour mark, perhaps best exemplified by  Declan Rice \u2019s high press on  Thomas Partey , which saw the ball turned over and the hosts win a penalty. \n Arsenal fans may use the same incident to draw attention to their own deficiencies. \n Partey struggled by his usual high standards, contributing a season-low three combined tackles and interceptions, and a season-low three recoveries. \n Perhaps it was because he lacked the usual metronomic midfield support of  Oleksandr Zinchenko . \n  Kieran Tierney  managed 67 touches. Even allowing for his 85th-minute substitution, that is considerably fewer than Zinchenko\u2019s 119 touches the last time Arsenal held the same possession share of 70 per cent. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Kieran Tierney touches v West Ham\n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Oleksandr Zinchenko's map showing 119 touches\n             \n \n Whatever the reason for Partey\u2019s relative lack of control, it was notable that substitute  Jorginho  managed 34 touches in 28 minutes, compared to Partey\u2019s 50 in 70 minutes. \n Arsenal needed calm, measured composure when leading 2-0, but instead they were ruffled by West Ham\u2019s aggressive pursuit of the ball, with the hosts posting their joint fourth-highest combined tackling and intercepting number of the season (34). \n The worry for Arsenal is that such brittleness at 2-0 will encourage future opponents, who, watching West Ham push on, may no longer fear the league leaders. \n Guardiola unlocks Leicester defence with another tweak \n As  predicted last week ,  Dean Smith  opted to park the bus on Saturday, but his plan to barricade the  Leicester City  penalty area was quickly undermined by a slick and ruthless Man City attack. \n \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n 3 - 1 \n \n LEI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n On the one hand, Smith\u2019s game plan was shredded by a freak disruption of a left-footed  John Stones  volley - yet even this can be explained by Guardiola\u2019s tactical genius. \n Another day, another subtle tactical intervention. Guardiola saw the Leicester blockade coming and opted to field  Rodri  alone at the base of midfield in front of a back three, freeing up another playmaker,  Bernardo Silva , to join the attack. \n Kyle Walker  was deployed in a traditional - though rare at City - overlapping right-back role, allowing  Riyad Mahrez  to also join Silva in central attacking positions. \n The build-up that led to Man City\u2019s first corner of the match, from which Stones scored, illustrates how the positioning of Mahrez and Silva gave the hosts an overwhelming central presence, releasing  Jack Grealish  to run at defenders with as many as three players -  Aymeric Laporte ,  Kevin De Bruyne  and Silva - supporting him. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Man City's throng of central players draw Leicester's defenders into the middle\n             \n \n Here below is another incident, moments before Grealish wins a free-kick from which, under pressure, Leicester concede the penalty that makes it 2-0. \n Again, the sheer volume of narrow Man City attackers pins Leicester's back five into a shape that frees Grealish. Quite simply, Leicester could not cope. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n It was a marked departure from Guardiola\u2019s normal use of a full-back in central midfield and the 3-2-5 shape that ordinarily keeps Mahrez holding the width on the right. \n On this occasion, that would have left City too light in the middle to deal with Leicester\u2019s crowded 5-4-1 formation. It was typically smart and typically unpredictable: the secret to City\u2019s relentless march. \n Latest reshuffle leaves Chelsea confused \n Brighton & Hove Albion 's domination at Stamford Bridge brought sharply into focus the chasm between these two clubs - the Seagulls' careful consideration in transfer policy and coaching, versus the scattergun disruptions that have left  Chelsea  flailing in mid-table. \n \n \n \n \n \n CHE \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 2 \n \n BHA \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n \u201cIt was the most deserving [defeat],\u201d  Frank Lampard  reflected. \u201cAt the moment, we need to talk about performances more than defeats. We were well beaten. In the basics of football, Brighton are a really good team, but we were shot in tackles, fight and yards.\u201d \n A choice few stats: Brighton outshot Chelsea 26-8, with 12 of those attempts coming in the first half, a record for a visiting side at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea\u2019s Expected Goals Against (xGA) figure of 2.9 was their highest of the season in all competitions, while their own Expected Goals (xG) tally of 0.5 was their fourth-lowest. \n They produced their fewest shot-creating actions (13) since a  1-0 defeat to Arsenal  in November and had just 43 per cent possession, their lowest share in a Premier League fixture since against  Liverpool  in August 2021 \u2013 66 matches ago. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Brighton shots v Chelsea\n             \n \n Lampard is not to blame for the mess he inherited, but attempts to seize control, to impose order on the chaos, have so far failed. \n Inconsistency in team selection and tactical style is surely a factor. Across their three defeats in eight days under Lampard, Chelsea have used three distinct formations and averaged five personnel changes per match. \n It gives the impression of a manager experimenting with an oversized squad that is craving structure, that needs the patterns of play which emerge when relationships are given time to build. \n Case in point: Chelsea have used 18 different centre-back partnerships in the Premier League this season, four more than the next-highest, West Ham. After just two matches, Lampard is already responsible for two of those. \n James emerges as Mitrovic replacement \n Prior to Saturday\u2019s 3-1 win at Everton, Fulham had won 35 points from 21 matches in which  Aleksandar Mitrovic  started and just four points from the eight in which he had not. Yet  Marco Silva  had a more specific reason for trying something different at Goodison Park - using  Dan James \u2019 pace to get behind  Everton . \n \n \n \n \n \n EVE \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 3 \n \n FUL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n \u201cWe changed the profile of our No 9 to use James as a striker because we wanted to explore some things in their back line, in behind the two central defenders,\u201d Silva told The Athletic following the match. \n It certainly worked. Fulham\u2019s victory was the first time since Mitrovic joined the club in 2018 that Fulham scored three goals in a Premier League match without him starting, and at their 35th attempt. \n James, who assisted the first and scored the third, played a starring role. \n He obviously could not mimic the style of the suspended Mitrovic and it will come as no surprise to learn James won zero of his six aerial duels, but his running into the channels helped stretch Everton out of shape, offering a new dimension to the Fulham attack. \n He received eight progressive passes, almost double Mitrovic\u2019s Premier League average of 4.5, and completed three progressive carries, far more than Mitrovic\u2019s average of one. \n James still had 36 touches of the ball, roughly the same as Mitrovic\u2019s season average of 37, and more importantly he had a big hand in all three goals. \n His clever backheel to assist  Harrison Reed  was superb centre-forward play, before in the second half his run into the channel dragged  James Tarkowski  out of position, ultimately allowing  Harry Wilson  to find space to score Fulham\u2019s second. The icing on the cake was a coolly-taken third. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Dan James passes v Everton\n             \n \n Howe fails to anticipate midfielders' movement \n The sheer dominance of  Aston Villa \u2019s victory over  Newcastle United  was among the biggest shocks of the weekend, and for that we must both praise  Unai Emery \u2019s formation and criticise  Eddie Howe \u2019s inability to anticipate it. \n \n \n \n \n \n AVL \n \n \n \n \n 3 - 0 \n \n NEW \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n The key players for Villa were  Jacob Ramsey  and  John McGinn , both instructed to roam infield from their wide starting positions to help Villa overload the centre of the pitch. That is not new. \n Emery has used this system relatively consistently since his appointment and it was no surprise to see them both pop up in space, ready to influence the match. \n Howe\u2019s reaction was a little surprising. As the below \"average position\" graphics show, while Villa were predictably narrow via Ramsey (No 41) and McGinn (No 7), Newcastle not only sat in a flat 4-4-2 formation \u2013 leaving just  Joelinton  and  Bruno Guimaraes  to deal with all those Villa players - but they also left huge pockets of space between their defensive and midfield lines. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Aston Villa's shape v Newcastle\n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Newcastle's shape v Aston Villa\n             \n \n The fallout from this mismatch was clear in the build-up to the first two Villa goals. First, notice how much space  Emiliano Buendia  can find between the lines, partly because  Joe Willock  - trying to keep track of Ramsey - was not part of a midfield three. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The second goal below was even more indicative of the pattern of the match: McGinn is ready to pick up the ball in space because Newcastle\u2019s two-man midfield are overwhelmed by Villa\u2019s five. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n There are a number of ways Howe might have chosen to fight Emery\u2019s system but a flat midfield four, with the wide men Willock and  Anthony Gordon  not tracking Ramsey and McGinn when they move infield, was not one of them. \n Perhaps hoping that by mirroring Villa\u2019s formation he could block it, Howe instead destabilised his own team. \n AFC Bournemouth\u2019s bravery pays off \n Gary O\u2019Neil  has surpassed the wildest expectations of every Premier League viewer, perhaps most of all his predecessor  Scott Parker , who was sacked back in August shortly after telling the media his players were \"not equipped to handle\" the quality in the top flight. \n \n \n \n \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 3 \n \n BOU \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n AFC Bournemouth  have won 12 points from their last six matches after recording back-to-back league wins for the first time this season with a 3-2 victory over  Tottenham Hotspur . \n It takes them to 33 points, six above the relegation zone and most likely in need of just one more win to stay up. \n \n \n \n The relegation fight \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Position \n Pos \n \n Club \n \n Played \n Pl \n \n GD \n \n Points \n Pts \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Chelsea \n CHE \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -9\n\n \n 44 \n \n \n \n 13 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Wolverhampton Wanderers \n WOL \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -27\n\n \n 41 \n \n \n \n 14 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n West Ham United \n WHU \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -13\n\n \n 40 \n \n \n \n 15 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Bournemouth \n BOU \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -34\n\n \n 39 \n \n \n \n 16 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Nottingham Forest \n NFO \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -30\n\n \n 38 \n \n \n \n 17 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Everton \n EVE \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -23\n\n \n 36 \n \n \n \n 18 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Leicester City \n LEI \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -17\n\n \n 34 \n \n \n \n 19 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Leeds United \n LEE \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -30\n\n \n 31 \n \n \n \n 20 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Southampton \n SOU \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -37\n\n \n 25 \n \n \n \n \n \n See the full table \n \n The key aspect, this weekend more than ever, is hard work and a brave approach to winning the ball back. \n O\u2019Neil\u2019s side rank third in the Premier League for total pressures (5717), and although that\u2019s not unexpected considering AFC Bournemouth are bottom of the league for average possession share (38.4 per cent), it\u2019s surprising they rank 10th for pressures in the attacking third (1,222). \n This is not a team who sit back.

Again, the doctors and especially the player will decide how does he feel. \n \u201cYesterday I spoke with him and he feels good. But we will see. \n \u201cLife is risk in these stages. You have to take it. We score a lot of goals this season. He scored an incredible amount of goals. But in the past always we scored a lot of goals.\u201d \n See:  How lethal Alvarez can shine with or without Haaland \n In the Premier League matches where Haaland has not started, the defending champions  laboured to a 1-0 win at Leicester City , and were drawing 1-1 at home to  Fulham  before the Norwegian came off the bench to  score the winner from the penalty spot . \n Guardiola did confirm the absence of midfielder  Phil Foden , who has  had an appendectomy  and will be out for 2-3 weeks, according to the Man City doctors. \n \u201cPhil had surgery,\u201d Pep added. \u201cThe doctors tell me two or three weeks.

He\u2019s so willing to be back with the team.\u201d \n See:  Premier League preview Matchweek 29 - what to look out for \n Saliba has been a key part of the third-best defence in the league this season, conceding 26 goals, so his absence would be a blow, even if  Rob Holding  deputised ably in the  4-1 win over Crystal Palace  in Arsenal\u2019s previous league match. \n The match with  Palace  was Holding\u2019s sole start in the Premier League this season and tougher opponents than out-of-form Eagles lie in wait for Arsenal, including trips to Liverpool, Man City and  Newcastle United . \n Hope for Jesus and Partey \n Arteta was more positive about forward  Gabriel Jesus , who he said was close to 100 per cent fitness after a knee injury suffered during the FIFA 2022 World Cup. Jesus has yet to start in the league since coming back, but Arteta feels that the international break has allowed the Brazilian to make important progress.\u00a0 \n \u201cHe's very close to that [100 per cent fitness],\u201d the Spaniard added. \n \u201cIn the last 10 days he's made a big step forward. You can see he's looser and not thinking about it. He's creating that chaos in training. He's in a really good place now.\u201d\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Thomas Partey  is also set to feature against Leeds. \n The Ghanian midfielder was accompanied by an Arsenal physio during international duty, and though he missed their second match in Africa Cup of Nations qualification, Arteta said he is \"hopeful\u201d that he'll play on Saturday. \n \u201cWe have a really good relationship with the Ghanaian federation and we have to manage and look after our players. \n \u201cThey have been really positive about it as well.

        "text": "\n The Scout analyses the strategies of 2022/23\u00a0 Fantasy Premier League \u00a0champion Ali Jahangirov, so other managers can learn from the best. \n Promoted clubs offer value \n A key part of being a Fantasy manager is choosing the best possible squad using the \u00a3100million budget.\u00a0 \n Title-winner Jahangirov believes that the teams coming up from the Championship can be a big help to managers next season. \n \"Last season, promoted teams were really exciting,\" he says.\u00a0 \n \" Nottingham Forest  were recruiting a lot of new players and were really promising, as well as  Fulham , who had a good start to the season, and with a good manager. I'll be doing my research during the summer, as I think some of Burnley's assets could be good value under Vincent Kompany. \n \"It is risky to go with promoted teams, but we all remember Sheffield United\u2019s  John Lundstram\u00a0 [in 2019/20 Fantasy], so we might have some gems.\" \n Picking differentials \n Over the course of the campaign Jahangirov had a number of cut-price players in his team including Fulham\u2019s  Andreas Pereira  and Everton\u2019s  Nathan Patterson , who he started the season with.\u00a0 \n But it is his later budget-friendly players he credits for helping him to victory.\u00a0 \n \"This season, I've had differential picks like  Wilfried Gnonto  from  Leeds United , who delivered well for me in a Double Gameweek,\" he says.\u00a0 \n See:\u00a0 Jahangirov's Double Gameweek 22 team \n \"I've had a lot of points from  Tyrone Mings  because he was quite cheap and was usually my first sub. He's scored over 30 or 40 points throughout five or six Gameweeks, even a 15-pointer from a clean sheet and a goal. When you get those points off the bench, it's really satisfying.\u201d \n Jahangirov also suggests a player's popularity in Fantasy can be crucial in deciding which budget options to pick. \n \"Going into a new season, I think you have to look at the transfers in and see what the ownership is\", Jahangirov adds. \n \"This season was really kind on budget because we had a lot of enablers from  Brighton & Hove Albion  and  Arsenal . Having  Marcus Rashford  for a starting cost of \u00a36.5m was really great.\" \n Risk-free approach \n Jahangirov adopted a risk-free approach when selecting his budget picks early on, using the ownership statistics as a guide. \n Later in the season, though, turning to in-form, cut-price differentials allowed him to get the edge on his rivals and ultimately helped steer him to glory. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 FPL champion: I thought I'd lost it on the final day Part 2:\u00a0 FPL champion: The one thing I changed to win title Part 3:  FPL champion's tips: Be flexible with your Gameweek 1 squad Part 4:\u00a0 FPL champion's tips: Play first Wildcard late Part 6:\u00a0 FPL champion\u2019s tips: Differential captains can pay off Part 7:  FPL champion\u2019s tips: Limit hits to Blanks and Double Gameweeks \n",

He is someone that young players learn from and that more experienced players respect.\u201d \u2013  Sir Alex Ferguson \n \u201cHe was a great player, without a doubt the best centre-back I ever played with. I would say for a time as well he was the best centre-back in the world. He was such a pleasure to play with. To play in front of him, he made your job so easy.\u201d \u2013  Paul Scholes \n \u201cNow the position of the centre-back is not just about defending or being nasty or tough. It\u2019s about knowing how to play football, control the ball, pass and be more comfortable in possession.\u00a0This is something that 10 years ago [in England] they didn\u2019t understand. Rio was the first one who did it.\u201d\u00a0\u2013\u00a0 Gerard Pique \n Did you know? \n Ferdinand has won the Premier League title more times than any other centre-back. \n Although Ferdinand only scored 11 PL goals, three of those came against Liverpool, for Leeds in April 2001 and Man Utd in January and October 2006. \n The centre-back kept 189 PL clean sheets, the third-most of any defender behind John Terry (214) and Jamie Carragher (195). \n",

That total places him second for Man Utd and fifth among defenders. \n Bring Dalot into your FPL team now \n Elsewhere,  Aleksandar Mitrovic  (\u00a36.8m) was on the scoresheet for the second successive group fixture for Serbia. \n However, the  Fulham  forward\u2019s goal was not enough to prevent his nation exiting the tournament after slipping to a 3-2 loss to Switzerland. \n The extra time off from international duties has lifted the appeal of Mitrovic when the campaign gets back underway. \n Indeed he is second only to  Marcus Rashford  (\u00a36.7m) for transfers in over the last 24 hours. \n First starts for Arsenal pair \n Arsenal \u2019s popular Fantasy pair  Gabriel Martinelli  (\u00a36.8m) and  Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a38.0m) were both handed their first starts of the tournament as Brazil rang the changes for their meeting with Cameroon. \n But the pair look likely to return to the substitutes bench for the last-16 tie against South Korea on Monday after failing to make an impact in the 1-0 defeat. \n All eyes on the last 16\u00a0 \n The knockout stages of the tournament get under way tomorrow when the Netherlands face USA. \n Manchester City \u2019s  Nathan Ake  (\u00a35.0m) and  Liverpool \u2019s  Virgil van Dijk  (\u00a36.5m) are expected to be part of a Dutch defence that have kept four clean sheets in their last five matches. \n Christian Pulisic  (\u00a35.7m) could prove decisive for USA once again if he recovers from a knock. The  Chelsea  star has been involved in both his nation\u2019s goals in the tournament, including his winner against Iran last time out. \n Argentina take on Australia later on Saturday, with the South Americans boasting a pair of in-form Premier League players. \n Brighton & Hove Albion \u2019s  Alexis Mac Allister  (\u00a35.4m) and Man City\u2019s  Julian Alvarez  (\u00a36.0m) both started and scored against Poland to help seal their place in the last 16.\u00a0 \n Saturday\u2019s matches 15:00 GMT Holland v USA 19:00 GMT Argentina v Australia \n",

According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), five of the Magpies\u2019 next eight matches score only two. \n Pope will continue to be a popular pick between the posts until the season breaks in Gameweek 16, when managers will have unlimited free transfers to freshen up their squads. \n Jordan Pickford (EVE) \u00a34.5m \n Back-to-back clean sheets against  Liverpool  and  West Ham United  have increased the appeal of investing in  Everton 's rearguard. \n Indeed, the Toffees have conceded just six goals this season, second only to the five of  Brighton & Hove Albion . \n If Pickford returns from the injury that forced him to miss the 1-0 win over the Hammers, his low cost and potential for save points means he could offer strong value between the posts. \n According to the FDR, five of Everton\u2019s matches between Gameweeks 9-16 score just two. \n Vicente Guaita (CRY) \u00a34.5m \n After their Blank Gameweeks 6 and 7,  Crystal Palace 's defence are low-owned heading into a very appealing run of opponents. \n Although the Eagles have conceded nine goals in six matches, six of those strikes came  against Arsenal  and  Manchester City . \n Essentially, then, they conceded just three goals in their other four outings, including a clean sheet in their last match  at Newcastle in Gameweek 6 . \n Patrick Vieira\u2019s side were a reliable source of defensive returns last term. Their total of 12 clean sheets was more than any other side outside the top five. \n Six of their next eight matches score only two in the FDR, so there is differential potential among Palace\u2019s key players. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:\u00a0 Tarkowski can outscore Patterson Part 3:  Set-piece threat raises Dier prospects Part 4:  Zaha has form and fixtures to thrive Part 5:  Maddison's value offers greater appeal Part 6:  Toney an all-round prospect Part 7:\u00a0 Kane merits premium spot next to Haaland \n",

Wolves  didn\u2019t get a single shot on target. \n Pervis Estupinan (BHA) Set up the opener before getting into the box again to score the third, while keeping  Bukayo Saka  in his pocket. \n Eberechi Eze (CRY) Two more brilliant goals. In this form, he won\u2019t want the season to end! \n Douglas Luiz (AVL) Loves playing  Spurs . Helped to win the midfield battle, and scored a brilliant free-kick. \n Ilkay Gundogan (MCI) He delivers in the big moments when City are chasing titles and most need a goal. He produced something from nothing with wonderful skill to break the deadlock, before a wonderful free-kick. \n Curtis Jones (LIV) Two goals in three minutes! The youngster has always looked neat and tidy. If he keeps performing like this, he will be hard to leave out. \n Mohamed Salah (LIV) Even when you stop him scoring, he still hurts you, setting up both of Jones\u2019s goals. \u00a0 \n Taiwo Awoniyi (NFO) Hitting form at precisely the right moment.  Chelsea  couldn\u2019t handle him as he scored two headers. He could be what keeps  Forest  up. \n Raheem Sterling (CHE) His second goal in particular gave Chelsea the clinical edge they have been missing for most of the season. \n Manager:  Roberto De Zerbi (BHA) His Brighton team didn\u2019t just beat title contenders  Arsenal , they outplayed them with a bold, quick, passing style that almost every team would love to play. \n",

        "text": "\n Mikel Arteta has praised the mentality of his  Arsenal  team after they maintained their eight-point lead over  Manchester City  at the top of the Premier League table with a 4-1 win over  Leeds United . \n \n \n \n \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 1 \n \n LEE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Man City had reduced the gap to five points after beating  Liverpool  4-1 in the day\u2019s opening match, so the pressure was on the leaders to restore the difference. \n They responded in fine style, easing past Leeds thanks to a double from  Gabriel Jesus , his first goals since 1 October last year. \n Arteta  confirmed a sickness bug had affected his squad, with  Bukayo Saka  not starting in the league for the first time this season, but said that his players showed great mentality to focus on their play and their results and not worry too much about the champions. \n \u201cWhat we can control is what we can do,\u201d Arteta told the  official Arsenal website . \u201cWe\u2019ve been discussing that for the last few days. \n \u201cAfter the international break we had a lot of tricky situations to manage with a few players and it\u2019s always a question mark with how the team is going to react after that. \n \u201cI think they were exceptional, they were really at it, everyone wanted to be involved and we won the game in a convincing way, which is good and the only thing that we can control.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Arteta was pleased that Jesus was back among the goals after his long-term knee injury suffered at the World Cup. \n \u201cI\u2019m delighted for him,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cThey were all clapping for him and he\u2019s been working so hard the last four or five months with a lot of support obviously from the team and the staff. \n \u201cToday he deserved the chance to start and he grabbed the opportunity with a lot of conviction and scoring two very important goals.\u201d \n One of Jesus\u2019s goals was set up by  Leandro Trossard , who provided his seventh assist for Arsenal since signing for them in January. Asked whether in his wildest dreams Arteta had envisaged such an impact from the Belgian. \n \u201cI have very wild dreams!\u201d answered Arteta. \u201cNo, seriously, we knew about his quality and what he could bring to the team. We are really pleased with him, he can play on the right, he can play on the left, he can play as an attacking midfielder, as a nine, a false nine. \n \u201cHe\u2019s really contributing to the team and he really takes a lot of responsibility in games to make things happen and we love that.\u201d \n \n \n \n Title race \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Position \n Pos \n \n Club \n \n Played \n Pl \n \n GD \n \n Points \n Pts \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Manchester City \n MCI \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +61\n\n \n 89 \n \n \n \n 2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Arsenal \n ARS \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +45\n\n \n 84 \n \n \n \n \n \n View More \n \n \n",

He loves scoring goals, so I think that is the most unique thing he has.\" \n Guardiola - Haaland fitness better \n Injuries have in the past limited Haaland's impact but  Pep Guardiola  says the striker is better with the foot-ligament issue that forced him to miss the starting XI for two Premier League matches. \n The City manager said Haaland will be fit to face  Leeds United  on Wednesday evening as his team look to return to second in the table and restore the five-point gap behind leaders  Arsenal . \n \u201cI think he will be ready,\u201d\u00a0Guardiola told  City's official website . \"Day by day he\u2019s getting better.

Even if the \u201cPep roulette\u201d means Haaland doesn\u2019t start, he seems very likely to return in limited minutes as shown in his 26-minute hat-trick on Wednesday.

Captaincy has cost me so many points this season \u2013 I\u2019m again tempted by Salah but  Aston Villa \u2019s defensive record and form in general means I just can\u2019t ignore Haaland this week. \n Pranil Sheth ( @Lateriser12 ) \n Captaincy is difficult this season because you're always wondering about the Haaland rest. Salah has played 190 minutes before facing Everton as well. If we get indication that Darwin Nunez (\u00a38.9m) starts, I might be tempted to go there but there is no reason to take it off  Haaland , is there?\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Ben Crabtree\u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n There's a temptation to go for Haaland, but I think  Harry Kane  (\u00a311.4m) at home to  Fulham  will be my choice. Kane has done quite well despite  Tottenham Hotspur  not being fully in their rhythm. \n \n \n \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n There's a new king in Fantasy this season, he's from Norway and he's already on an incredible nine goals. There is a risk that Pep Guardiola rests him for the trip to Villa Park but, having come off early in the last two fixtures, it's a risk I'm willing to take.  Haaland  gets my armband again this week. \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n I'm prepared to take the risk on  Haaland  again this week on current form. His early substitution against  Nottingham Forest  gives me hope for minutes against Villa this weekend. \n Pras ( @Pras_fpl ) \n Captaincy seems wide open this week. After back-to-back hat-tricks, the natural pick would be Haaland, but with Sevilla, Spurs and Borussia Dortmund as their next three opponents in all competitions, I am sceptical on a Haaland start away to Villa. Aside from him, Kane against Fulham is the standout pick. My captain will be  Salah ; you can never back against him in a Merseyside derby. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 GW6 Ones to watch: Sterling to continue home run Part 2:  GW6 Differentials: Johnson set to trouble Cherries Part 3:  Scout Selection: Best FPL team for Gameweek 6 Part 4:  GW6 Captains: Haaland worth the risk \n Don't forget the Gameweek 6 deadline is 11:00 BST on Saturday 3 September. \n",

It is the highest individual honour awarded by the League. \n Ferdinand became a six-time Premier League winner with Man Utd, first lifting the trophy in 2002/03 after breaking the British transfer record in joining from Leeds. \n Known as one of the greatest ball-playing central defenders of his era, Ferdinand\u2019s ability to carry and play the ball, paired with his natural pace and relentless desire to win set him apart. \n He was part of the Man Utd team who retained the Premier League title in 2006/07, 2007/08 and 2008/09 and secured his sixth title in 2012/13, reclaiming it from  Manchester City  in Ferguson\u2019s final season at the club. \n Career in numbers \n \n \n \n \n Category \n Rio Ferdinand \n \n \n \n \n Appearances \n 504 \n \n \n Goals \n 11 \n \n \n Assists \n 8 \n \n \n Clean sheets \n 189 \n \n \n PL titles \n 6 \n \n \n Monthly awards \n 1 \n \n \n \n \n After making his debut as a 17-year-old for  Harry Redknapp \u2019s West Ham, Ferdinand played in 504 matches across 20 Premier League seasons, keeping 189 clean sheets in the competition, an incredibly impressive ratio of 37.5 per cent of matches he played in. \n \u201cAs a defender, I'm not used to celebrating personal glory - we leave that to the midfielders and strikers!\" Ferdinand said. \"When you start your career, you never dream of how well things could turn out. \n \u201cI remember all those long journeys on trains and tubes; all the training, cleaning players\u2019 boots and taking care of the kit.

These are reasonable fixtures to swerve away from in return for a player who doubles in Gameweek 27, has a fixture in Gameweek 28 and doubles in Gameweek 29.   Ivan   Toney  (\u00a37.7m) or  Even Ferguson  (\u00a34.6m) fit that bill.  If you want to hold Haaland against Palace then you could switch him for  Ollie Watkins  (\u00a37.3m) or  Kelechi Iheanacho  (\u00a36.2m) afterwards, as they have a fixture in Gameweek 28 and a Double in 29. \n Nick Harris ( @WGTA_Nick ) \n I wouldn't sell  Haaland . He could easily haul in a single Gameweek and outscore all the players with Doubles. Each transfer is expensive, unless you're using chips, and you'll just want him back straight after Blank Gameweek 28. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n I will likely be selling  Haaland  knowing I will only miss one fixture over Gameweeks 28 and 29, which is Liverpool at home. This will allow me to punt on a forward who has three fixtures in that time, like  Joao Felix  (\u00a37.6m) or  Watkins . \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Haaland  can explode on any given day. It wasn't that long ago he was banging in that 54-minute  hat-trick against Wolverhampton Wanderers  in Gameweek 21. Since then, though, it's only two goals in six appearances, so if you really need the money for other things then I suppose the case could be made. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @Zophar666 ) \n I wouldn't sell  Haaland  in Gameweek 27 but when we get to Gameweek 28, if you are not Free-Hitting there is a case for it. Haaland won't be captained in either Gameweek 28 or 29. If you sell, you can buy him back in place of someone like  Toney  in Gameweek 30 if you plan your funds accordingly. \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n I have too much money invested in  Haaland  to consider selling him. If I take him out I will need to find an extra \u00a30.4m to buy him back after Double Gameweek 29. I will be holding Haaland through Blank Gameweek 28, and even with just his one fixture in Gameweek 29. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n If you need the cash to afford Double Gameweek players then  Haaland  is probably worth taking out. This anticipates you getting your likely four-point spend back with the players that you bring in to replace him. But I don't think it'll be required for a lot of teams to sell Haaland, given the number of affordable good options. \n Jamie Piggott ( @Futbolislifefpl ) \n The safe play is to keep  Haaland  but if you're looking for a way to risk it a little for a chance to climb the ranks, a short-term move away is definitely an option. However, it would be good to keep a path open to move back to Haaland, given he plays  Southampton  in Gameweek 30. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 Is Haaland a short-term sell in Fantasy? \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout's panel of  Fantasy Premier League  experts share their thoughts on the best attackers to own for Double Gameweek 25 ahead of  Friday's 18:30 GMT deadline . \n Sam Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n Of the DGW teams  Arsenal  and  Liverpool  look the best attacks to target.  Bukayo Saka  (\u00a38.4m) looks the must-have of the attacking options as long as his ankle is OK after Gameweek 23's match with  Aston Villa . \n Cody Gakpo  (\u00a37.8m) also looks to be a great differential after back-to-back goals in GW23 and 24. The midfielder is only owned by 4.0 per cent of managers and is much easier for managers to budget for without selling the likes of  Harry Kane  (\u00a311.7m) to fund  Mohamed Salah  (\u00a312.6m). \n However don't overlook the single gameweekers with great fixtures, who could end up bringing great returns in GW25, such as  Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.2m) against  AFC Bournemouth . \n Pranil Sheith ( @lateriser12 ) \n Despite not boasting very encouraging numbers, I've already bought in  Salah  because simply put, in a double, I will back him.  Eddie Nketiah  (\u00a36.8m) has been unlucky of late but I think eventually, he'll deliver on his underlyings. \n I also fancy getting in  Darwin Nunez  (\u00a38.7m) to catch him on the day, if he buries his chances instead of missing them, as long as he is fit and available.\u00a0 \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @Zophar666 ) \n Saka ,  Martin Odegaard  (\u00a37.0m) and  Nketiah  would be my top three picks in that order. Liverpool have also showed glimpses of their old self over the last two matches. \u00a0Salah  and  Nunez , if injury-free, are top picks and \u00a0Gakpo  is also worth a look. \n Lee Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n I noticed  Gakpo 's confidence visibly soar where he scored his first goal for Liverpool in the Merseyside derby and he followed that strike up with another against  Newcastle . \n If you've got your eye on a Liverpool midfielder,  Salah  is the best choice in my opinion, but at his price it might mean making sacrifices you don't want to make - like  Kevin De Bruyne  (\u00a312.4m) or  Kane . \n If that's the case, then Gakpo is a differential worth looking at given his low ownership. \n Ben Crabtree\u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg) \n Saka ,  Odegaard ,  Nketiah ,  Salah  and  Nunez  seem the best picks if you're looking to buy. I think  Gabriel Martinelli  (\u00a36.5m) is worth holding but not taking a hit to buy. \n Dwight McNeil  (\u00a35.1m) is probably the best option from  Everton  or  Wolves  as he looks to deliver the ball in the box at every opportunity. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n Most managers already have triple Arsenal, so we have to look to Liverpool to cover an attack that is starting to convert more of their chances. \n Whilst  Salah ,  Nunez  and  Gakpo  are all more obvious attacking transfers, don't forget that the Liverpool full-backs regularly produce good assist threat. \n Pras ( @Pras_FPL ) \n I think owning the penalty takers over a DGW is always wise, and that makes  Salah  and  Saka \u00a0my top two picks. \n Both Liverpool and Arsenal are great attacks so pairing them with another like  Nunez , if fit, and  Odegaard  or  Nketiah , would be wise. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  FPL experts: Best Double Gameweek 25 defenders \n",

The  Leicester City  playmaker has produced 39 shots and created 31 chances. He is the only midfielder to rank among the top four for both statistics. \n A lack of European competition for Leicester reduces any chance of Maddison being rotated and arguably makes him the most secure starter in this bracket. \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n The \u00a38.0m midfielder slot was one that I was very keen on in Gameweek 1.

Now there's a wealth of great options including the likes of  Saka  and  Maddison . \n However, it\u2019s  Dejan Kulusevski  (\u00a38.0m) who is my preferred pick. The  Tottenham Hotspur \u00a0star has recovered from injury and his country, Sweden, were not involved in the FIFA World Cup 2022. Spurs also have nice fixtures and could also have a Double Gameweek 20. \n See:\u00a0 Two possible Double Gameweeks for Man City \n West Ham United \u2019s fixtures mean  Jarrod Bowen  (\u00a38.0m) could be a great differential too. I am also keeping an eye on  Liverpool \u2019s  Diaz.  If he is fit to play in Gameweek 17 he could be a brilliant pick for their nice fixture run. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n There's definitely still value in the \u00a38.0m midfield price bracket.  Manchester City 's  Phil Foden  (\u00a38.3m) will still be at the front of my mind, assuming he comes back from Qatar in good shape, but it looks like  Diaz  will be available for Liverpool and back on the radar. \n The Colombian has three goals and two assists in eight appearances this season, and Jurgen Klopp will need one of his key attacking players fit and firing when the Premier League resumes on Boxing Day. \n Nick ( @WGTA_Nick ) \n There are still plenty of options in the \u00a38.0m bracket, with some excellent players at very affordable prices.  Saka ,  Maddison  and  Foden  are three that can easily slot in as a second or third midfielder in our squads. \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n The \u00a38.0m midfielders are still at the forefront of my thinking. I will certainly be keeping a minimum of two slots in my team for this price point. \n Foden ,  Saka ,  Kulusevski  and  Diaz  can rival any premium players at their respective clubs. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Best Newcastle picks Part 2:  Best Arsenal picks Part 4:  How many premiums should managers pick?

        "text": "\n In Friday's press conference, Fulham head coach  Marco Silva  provided an  update on the fitness \u00a0of Aleksandar Mitrovic (\u00a36.8m), who is owned by 27 per cent of Fantasy managers. \n \u201cHe was outside this morning doing some work, getting better, but he is still a doubt for the match,\u201d Silva said. \u201cAgain, we have to assess him tomorrow, do what we should do with him, and take the decision for the match. \n \n \n \n \n \n WHU \n \n \n \n \n 3 - 1 \n \n FUL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n FUL \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 2 \n \n BOU \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n \u201cIt's not something really serious. Let's see if he can be ready for Sunday against West Ham. He will be ready for AFC Bournemouth for sure, we hope, and let's see if he can be ready or not for West Ham.\u201d \n The Scout\u2019s panel of  Fantasy Premier League  experts share their thoughts on what owners should do with the  Fulham  star. \n What the experts say \n Sam Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n With Fulham,  Southampton  and a leaky  Liverpool  defence to face in the next three matches for around the same price as Mitrovic,  Gianluca Scamacca  (\u00a36.7m) could be a good option.  \n The West Ham forward made his second start of the season in GW9 and returned eight points thanks to a goal and two bonus points. With nice fixtures and an ownership of just 0.7 per cent, he could be a good differential. \n Lee Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n With Mitrovic facing a late check, I'll likely hold as Fulham's fixtures look good moving forward and he's their talisman.  \n If you want to replace him and are strapped for cash, consider  Danny Welbeck  (\u00a36.5m). He's been quoted in the press as \"excited\" to be playing under new head coach Roberto De Zerbi - and the Italian got a lot out of his No 9s at previous clubs. It's a bit of a gamble with  Brighton & Hove Albion 's fixtures, but keep an eye on him. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n It is hard to know what to do with the forward.\u00a0 If he is out for more than a week,  Callum Wilson  (\u00a37.2m) looks the standout replacement. He's scored three in four appearances for  Newcastle United  and when fit he guarantees goals. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n This is all about time, which sadly we don't always have.  Wilson  and  Welbeck  are both on my radar but, with two free transfers, I will even consider moving him down to bench fodder to boost my midfield. However, this is not ideal, with Blank Gameweek 12 on the horizon. \n Pras\u00a0( @Pras_fpl ) \n With Mitrovic's injury looking short term, Fantasy managers should consider benching him for a week if possible.  \n If you need a guaranteed starter for this week,  Wilson  is the best dependable option for a similar budget. At the lower end,  Dominic Solanke  (\u00a35.7m) still appeals for his price, fixtures and the fact that he's on penalties.  \n Other left-field options include  Scamacca ,  Welbeck ,  Anthony Martial  (\u00a36.9m),  Patson Daka  (\u00a35.7m) and  Ollie Watkins  (\u00a37.2m). \n Jamie Pigott ( @Futbolislifefpl ) \n I prefer to keep him, with AFC Bournemouth at home in Gameweek 11.\u00a0 But if managers want to make the change, I like  Wilson . When he's fit, he scores goals. \n See:\u00a0 Your essential FPL tips for Gameweek 10 \n GW10 deadline: 13:30 BST, Sat 8 Oct \n",

A first defeat in 11 matches for Villa leaves them seventh on 54 points. \n Liverpool edge seven-goal thriller \n Liverpool  kept their European ambitions on course, climbing above  Tottenham Hotspur  into fifth in a dramatic 4-3 win at Anfield. \n For the second Sunday in a row, Spurs suffered a horrendous away start.\u00a0After going 5-0 down at Newcastle in 21 minutes a week ago ended  Cristian Stellini \u2019s time as interim boss, his replacement  Ryan Mason  saw his team concede three unanswered goals inside the opening quarter of an hour. \n Curtis Jones  started it in the third minute with his first league goal of the season. Two minutes later  Luis Diaz  made it 2-0 in his first start in 203 days after injury.  Mohamed Salah  scored the third from the penalty spot after  Cristian Romero  had fouled  Cody Gakpo . \n As at Newcastle,  Harry Kane  pulled a goal back for Spurs, brilliantly volleying in  Ivan Perisic \u2019s cross on 39 minutes. It was his 25th Premier League goal of the season, the fourth time he has reached this mark, a feat only  Alan Shearer  can also claim. It was also his 208th\u00a0in the competition overall, moving him level in second with  Wayne Rooney  in the all-time scoring charts. \n See:  How Kane compares with Rooney \n Spurs hit the post twice inside 60 seconds in a much more even second half and got the second goal they deserved when  Son Heung-min  finished well from Romero\u2019s ball over the top. \n Substitute  Richarlison 's first league goal for Spurs in the third minute of added time looked to have claimed a point, but late Spurs substitute  Lucas Moura  misplaced a backpass from a Liverpool long ball to let in  Diogo Jota  to score the winner. \n A third defeat in four matches drops Spurs to sixth on 54 points, two behind Liverpool, having played a match more. \n See:  Who can qualify for Europe \n \n \n \n The race for Europe \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Position \n Pos \n \n Club \n \n Played \n Pl \n \n GD \n \n Points \n Pts \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Manchester United \n MUN \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +15\n\n \n 75 \n \n \n \n 4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Newcastle United \n NEW \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +35\n\n \n 71 \n \n \n \n 5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Liverpool \n LIV \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +28\n\n \n 67 \n \n \n \n 6 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Brighton & Hove Albion \n BHA \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +19\n\n \n 62 \n \n \n \n 7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Aston Villa \n AVL \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +5\n\n \n 61 \n \n \n \n 8 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Tottenham Hotspur \n TOT \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +7\n\n \n 60 \n \n \n \n \n \n View More \n \n Cherries on a roll \n AFC Bournemouth  look all but safe after a fifth win in seven matches, beating  Leeds United  4-1 in a relegation six-pointer. \n \n \n \n \n \n BOU \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 1 \n \n LEE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n The home side raced into a two-goal lead courtesy of a brace from  Jefferson Lerma .

He needs time to get himself that confident and physical state to compete with a free mind, and when he is free to do that we will throw him in.\u201d \n Gunners have coped well \n Arteta\u2019s willingness to give Jesus time may be largely due to the fact that his team have actually been performing well without their No 9. \n While Jesus initially scored five times in his first eight Premier League appearances for the Gunners, he then went six matches without a goal up until the World Cup. \n In his absence, there has been little discernible difference to  Arsenal \u2019s attacking threat. \n The Gunners\u2019 averages for goals per match and Expected Goals have stayed almost the same, with the former dropping slightly by 0.2 and the latter rising minimally by 0.1. \n Arsenal with and without Jesus \n \n \n \n Premier League \n With Jesus \n Without Jesus \n \n \n \n \n Matches \n 14 \n 12 \n \n \n Goals/match \n 2.4 \n 2.2 \n \n \n Expected Goals/match \n 1.9 \n 2.0 \n \n \n Shots/match \n 15.9 \n 17.5 \n \n \n Shots on target/match \n 5.8 \n 4.8 \n \n \n Touches in opp. box/match \n 35.4 \n 41.4 \n \n \n Points/match \n 2.6 \n 2.2 \n \n \n \n That reflects well upon the impact of back-up striker  Eddie Nketiah , and then of January signing  Leandro Trossard . \n Arteta certainly deserves credit for his recent use of Trossard. The Belgian has been deployed up front in a role similar to Jesus\u2019s, moving out to the left side to create space for  Gabriel Martinelli , who has burst into the box to score four goals in his last four matches. \n Nonetheless, the statistics above also show what Jesus brings to the team. \n While Arsenal have had more shots without him, they have had fewer attempts on target. That suggests the lack of a clinical edge at times, which was perhaps most evident in the  3-1 home defeat to Man City , when nine of their 10 attempts missed the goal. \n Overall, the simple fact is the Gunners average more points per match when Jesus plays, with 2.6 compared to 2.2, and that difference could be decisive in the title race. \n",

Mohamed Salah  (\u00a313.0m) will be desperate to get on the scoresheet after missing out in a  9-0 win over AFC Bournemouth  and he is the safer pick.\u00a0 \n Pras ( @Pras_fpl ) \n I'm giving  Salah  another go this Gameweek. Despite having no returns against AFC Bournemouth, his underlying data was better than Haaland's last weekend, which suggests goals are coming. If there was no rotation risk; I would have probably sided with the Norwegian, but the threat of a one-point cameo makes Salah the safer pick. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n After his  hat-trick against Crystal Palace ,  Haaland  is flying for Man City, so I'll be going in with the big Norwegian. Steven Gerrard's Aston Villa, on the other hand, haven't started well and are conceding for fun, so  Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a38.2m) is a pretty good option, too.\u00a0 \n Sam Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n Guardiola\u2019s comments about Haaland not being able to start three matches in a week have worried me in terms of handing the Manchester City forward the armband. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n While Haaland is my preferred pick, the potential for him to rest means that I will likely hand the armband to  Jesus  or  Salah .

I'll be going with  Salah , who will come out all guns blazing due to his flop against AFC Bournemouth.\u00a0 \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n With concerns around minutes for Haaland this midweek, I'm going to play it safe with  Jesus  who has the home form against a struggling Aston Villa side.\u00a0 \n Nick\u00a0 ( @WGTA_Nick )\u00a0\u00a0 \n Haaland  is my pick for the armband in the midweek matches. He has had a sensational start at Man City, hitting the ground immediately and there are more goals to come, which I want to capitalise on as much as possible. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 GW5 Ones to watch: Kane backed to extend goal streak Part 2:\u00a0 GW5 Differentials: Eze can unlock Brentford defence Part 3:\u00a0 Scout Selection: Best FPL team for Gameweek 5 Part 4:  GW5 Captains: Back De Bruyne over Haaland \n Don't forget the Gameweek 5 deadline is 18:00 BST on Tuesday 30 August. \n",

It is very rare that the design itself changes, so it is an honour for the team at Avery Dennison to have been part of that process. \n \"The request was for the new design to be an evolution rather than a revolution. With many components to be considered, such as legibility, durability and readability, we also needed to keep sight of the Premier League branding. Through everything, we wanted to ensure that what we put on the pitch keeps the fans in the stadium and watching at home at the heart of it.\" \n With Avery Dennison's sustainability credentials at the forefront of the manufacturing process, the names, numbers and sleeve badges are produced at its factory in Western Norway, powered by renewable energy from a nearby glacier. \n With printing and robotics technology in place to reduce waste, the Premier League embellishments are printed on a thin and digital layer, using a digitised process to determine the placement of the transfers and ensure the best utilisation of the sheet, ensuring minimal waste. \n The new names, numbers and sleeve badges will be available from spring onwards, following the launch of each Premier League club's kits for the 2023/24 season. \n",

The 33-year-old has repaid that trust with a hugely impressive campaign. \n Whether he is operating on the left of a central-defensive pair, or as part of a back three, Mee has been a consistently sound performer. \n Mee's defensive stats 22/23 \n \n \n \n Statistic \n Ben Mee \n PL rank \n \n \n \n \n Aerial duels won \n 84 \n 1st \n \n \n Blocks \n 27 \n 2nd \n \n \n Headed shots \n 11 \n 4th \n \n \n Interceptions \n 32 \n 6th \n \n \n \n No top-flight defender has won more aerial duels than Mee, who is 12 ahead of the next-closest player, his former Burnley defensive partner  James Tarkowski , now at  Everton . \n As shown in the table above, Mee has used his defensive acumen wisely, stepping forward to make a string of decisive interceptions throughout this season. \n Going forward, Mee has been a major threat inside the opposition box too. \n He has scored three times, in home matches against  Manchester United ,  Wolverhampton Wanderers  and  Southampton .

        "text": "\n The transfer of  Joao Cancelo  from  Manchester City  to Bayern Munich means  Fantasy Premier League  has lost one of its best defenders of recent times, albeit one who was slipping off the radar of late.\u00a0 \n A string of blanks and absences from Gameweek 17 meant more than half a million FPL managers had sold the Portuguese before his move was confirmed. But he provided so many good memories for those who owned him. \n Here are some of the reasons why Cancelo became an FPL legend. \n No defender could beat his nine double-figure hauls over the last two seasons, joint-top with  Trent Alexander-Arnold  (\u00a37.3m). \u00a0 \n Over the last two seasons, Cancelo had 98 shots, 26 of which were on target. Both of these stats were top among Premier League defenders. \n Since the 2020/21 season, Cancelo registered 17 assists, five goals and\u00a044 clean sheets in the competition. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n 2021/22 season\u00a0 \n Last season, Cancelo was the second-highest scoring defender in the game, with 201 points. Only Alexander-Arnold outscored him, with 208. \n Cancelo also became an FPL favourite because he was one of the few Man City players who avoided \"Pep roulette\". He started in 36 of their 38 Premier League matches in 2021/22. \n From those 36 starts, he averaged an impressive 5.6 FPL points per start. He ranked top for expected goals (xG) among defenders. \n In a team full of stars, Cancelo's 31 returns that season were the most of any City player and could only be beaten by four other players.\u00a0 \n Alongside\u00a0 Son Heung-min  (\u00a311.6m), Cancelo was the player whose FPL price went up the most during 2021/22, rising by \u00a31.6m across the campaign.\u00a0 \n 2022/23 season \n Until Gameweek 17 of this season, Cancelo had started 50 of the last 51 league matches for which he was available. But threafter that started to change; he started only two matches and was withdrawn at half-time of the  1-0 win at Chelsea  in Gameweek 19. \n Yet, despite this lack of minutes since the FIFA World Cup 2022, Cancelo leaves with more returns than any other Man City defender this season: 10. \n His three double-figure scores in home matches this season are bettered by only  Erling Haaland  (\u00a312.2m) and  Marcus Rashford  (\u00a37.2m), with five and four respectively. \n Cancelo's 12 chances created this season are seven clear of\u00a0 Nathan Ake  (\u00a35.0m), who is City's next most creative defender. \n Two of Cancelo's biggest FPL returns have come during this season. He returned 18 points in the  4-0 victory over Southampton  in Gameweek 10 and 12 points in the  6-0 success against Nottingham Forest  in Gameweek 5.\u00a0 \n Cancelo's biggest FPL returns \n \n \n \n Season \n Opp. \n Result \n FPL points \n \n \n \n \n 2022/23 \n SOU (H) \n 4-0 \n 18 \n \n \n 2021/22 \n NEW (A) \n 0-4 \n 18 \n \n \n 2020/21 \n WBA (A) \n 0-5 \n 17 \n \n \n 2021/22 \n MUN (A) \n 0-2 \n 14 \n \n \n 2022/23 \n NFO (H) \n 6-0 \n 12 \n \n \n \n Cancelo is owned by more than a third of FPL managers. The next most-heavily owned City defender is  Ruben Dias  (\u00a35.9m), at just 5.6 per cent. \n Following Cancelo's move, FPL managers will need to consider who the best replacements are for one of the best defenders in the game in recent memory. \n See:  Best Cancelo replacements in Fantasy Premier League \n",

From open play, Chelsea have an Expected Goals Against (xGA) score of 14.46, which ranks 13th among all teams this season. \n Summer signing Fofana, 22, will reinforce them at the back. \n He was named in two of Potter's first three starting XIs, playing his part in victories versus  Crystal Palace  and AC Milan, scoring his maiden Chelsea goal against the Italian side. \n However, the former  Leicester City  star was forced off with a knee problem in the 38th minute of that UEFA Champions League match. \n Versatile defender \n Since a superb 2020/21 campaign, Fofana has endured a frustrating spell. \n Last term he was limited to only seven top-flight starts, after fracturing his fibula in a pre-season friendly for Leicester. \n It was his previous form that earned him a move to Stamford Bridge, though, and if he can replicate those consistent performances, he will become a firm favourite in west London. \n When fully fit, Fofana would likely be regarded as first-choice ahead of  Trevoh Chalobah  and  Cesar Azpilicueta  on the right of a back three. \n The Frenchman is also a reliable option to play on the right of a central defensive pairing, just as he did at Selhurst Park in Potter\u2019s first Premier League match at the helm. \n On the front foot \n Fofana is outstanding at the art of making interceptions. \n Positionally sound, but also proactive in his approach, he is adept at stepping forward to regain possession from a stray pass. \n This season, he is averaging 3.5 interceptions per match in the Premier League, making nine interceptions in two outings for the Foxes prior to his transfer. \n Fofana interceptions 2022/23 \n \n \n \n Opponent \n Interceptions \n \n \n \n \n Brentford \n 5 \n \n \n Arsenal \n 4 \n \n \n West Ham \n 1 \n \n \n Crystal Palace \n 4 \n \n \n \n Breaking up play with eye-catching interceptions is undoubtedly one of Fofana\u2019s great strengths. \n During his imperious 2020/21 campaign, his first in English football, he made the joint-fourth most interceptions by defenders. \n The Blues will benefit greatly from this aspect of his game. \n Most interceptions in 2020/21 \n \n \n \n Defender \n Interceptions \n \n \n \n \n Jan Bednarek (SOU) \n 84 \n \n \n Ben White (BHA) \n 62 \n \n \n Aaron Wan-Bissaka (MUN) \n 62 \n \n \n Wesley Fofana (LEI) \n 61 \n \n \n Liam Cooper (LEE) \n 61 \n \n \n \n Fofana is due to return to fitness around the same time as another key Chelsea player,  Reece James . \n The availability of these two excellent young defenders will have a positive impact on the team. \n Both bring pace, strength, ball-carrying excellence and high levels of technical ability on the ball. \n Chelsea will be thrilled to have both players back as they target a return to winning ways. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Smith Rowe return will sharpen Arsenal's cutting edge Part 2:  How Isak can fire Newcastle's top-four challenge Part 3:  Martial ready to be United's leading man after Ronaldo exit \n",

The Danish goalkeeper played every single minute of the campaign and kept 14 clean sheets. Schmeichel remained at Leicester for another six seasons, before departing in the summer of 2022 to French club Nice. \n Danny Simpson \n A product of  Manchester United 's Academy, Simpson spent five seasons at King Power Stadium, before joining Huddersfield Town in 2019. The right-back is currently plying his trade with Championship side Bristol City. \n Wes Morgan \n Captain Fantastic, Morgan's leadership was key to Leicester's historic triumph. He remained with the Foxes until he retired from football in 2021, lifting the FA Cup in his final season. He is now a member of the Premier League\u2019s Black Participants\u2019 Advisory Group. \n Robert Huth \n Huth left Leicester when his contract expired in the summer of 2018. Since hanging up his boots, the German has completed a Master of Science in Sports Directorship degree.\u00a0 \n Christian Fuchs \n The charismatic Austrian swapped Leicester for a move to Major League Soccer side Charlotte FC in 2021, taking in a loan spell at Charlotte Independence. Outside of football, Fuchs runs a public relations company and a football academy. \n Riyad Mahrez \n One of the star men in 2015/16, Mahrez departed for  Manchester City  in the summer of 2018. He has gone on to win a further three Premier League titles and was part of the side who finished runners-up in the 2020/21 UEFA Champions League. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Danny Drinkwater \n Another Man Utd Academy graduate, the midfielder found a home at Leicester following several loan spells. However, a transfer to  Chelsea  in 2017 yielded only 12 Premier League appearances and several loans. Drinkwater is currently a free agent. \n N'Golo Kante \n Arriving as an unknown quantity from French side Caen in 2015, Kante was a revelation in central midfield during his sole season at Leicester. He joined Chelsea in the summer of 2016 and picked up another Premier League winner's medal, while he has also won the Champions League and FA Cup. He helped France claim the 2018 FIFA World Cup. \n Marc Albrighton \n A terrific servant for Leicester, Albrighton is one of only two players from  Claudio Ranieri 's 2015/16 starting XI who is still with the club. He was part of the side who reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League a year later and lifted the FA Cup in 2021. \n Shinji Okazaki \n The perfect foil to  Jamie Vardy , the Japanese forward spent four seasons with Leicester before moving to Spain to play for Malaga, Huesca and most recently  Cartagena in the second tier. His contract expired this summer. \u00a0 \n Jamie Vardy \n Vardy's record-breaking campaign earned him the 2015/16 EA SPORTS Player of the Season award, as he memorably scored in 11 successive matches.

However, I will have an exit plan thereafter, particularly in the case of Mount. \n Chelsea's next four Gameweeks \n \n \n \n GW \n Opp. \n FDR* \n \n \n \n \n 17 \n BOU (H) \n 2 \n \n \n 18 \n NFO (A) \n 2 \n \n \n 19 \n MCI (H), FUL (A) \n 5, 2 \n \n \n 20 \n CRY (H) \n 2 \n \n \n \n * Fixture Difficulty Rating \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n If you're an FPL manager that plays the fixtures, you have to look at Chelsea.  James , \u00a0Mount  and \u00a0Arrizabalaga  all deserve our consideration, while  Lewis Hall  (\u00a34.5m)\u00a0could become an exciting option at left wing-back for Graham Potter. \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n Chelsea players are fool's gold, for me. I'm not getting drawn in by favourable fixtures and a Double as we don't know who the starters are. I'm prepared to take a risk on  Arrizabalaga , knowing I've got  Danny Ward  (\u00a34.1m) to deputise if needed. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n At his price, it's hard to look past  Arrizabalaga  as the value-for-money pick between the sticks.  Elsewhere, it's more difficult. \u00a0 \n James  has looked ready to go in some of the friendly matches I've seen over the break. I believe Potter will have been working hard on their defensive shape too, so I'd expect improvement. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n I like Chelsea's fixtures and they have players who can return, even  against Manchester City . I always like owning \u00a0James  when fit and will be looking at  Arrizabalaga ,  Marc Cucurella  (\u00a35.1m),  Raheem Sterling  (\u00a39.7m) and \u00a0Mount ,\u00a0too. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n Chelsea play all three of the promoted teams in back-to-back Gameweeks, so there is definitely reason to invest.  James  and  Arrizabalaga \u00a0are both fit and great picks, but investing in the attack is trickier, with  Mount  the only nailed option. \n Lateriser ( @lateriser12 ) \n Chelsea's fixtures in Gameweeks 17 and 18 are great. They always function better with \u00a0James  fit, which looks set to be the case. I'm happy to roll the dice on a couple of their players given the schedule. \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Chelsea have kept just four clean sheets this season, fewer than teams like  Newcastle United ,  Arsenal ,  Leicester City  and  Manchester United , whose defenders cost less. \n James ' timely return from injury makes him an attractive option as a result of his attacking threat. He registered 14 attacking returns from five goals and nine assists last season. However, in Double Gameweek 19, Chelsea face Man City and  Fulham . City's 40 goals scored so far this season is more than any other team. Meanwhile, Fulham have netted an impressive 24 times, with only six sides scoring more.  \n If you invest in James and the Chelsea defence then it should be for their attacking threat, rather than clean sheets, which don't look likely in the Double. \n See:\u00a0 Your essential FPL tips for Gameweek 17 \n",

He played every minute, kept the joint-most clean sheets, won the FIFA Golden Glove award and starred in two penalty shootouts including the final.

A shoutout too to his compatriot\u00a0 Lisandro Martinez \u00a0of  Manchester United . \n Raphael Varane (MUN) \n In a central defence that was regularly changed by Didier Deschamps, the France coach relied on the Man Utd centre-back, who steered his nation to back-to-back World Cup finals.\u00a0 \n Bukayo Saka (ARS) \n Aged just 21, the  Arsenal  and England winger scored three goals in four starts at his first World Cup.  Marcus Rashford  also deserves a mention, after also being brilliant for the Three Lions. \n Hakim Ziyech (CHE) \n The  Chelsea  winger played the second-most minutes at the tournament of any outfield Premier League player,\u00a0getting a goal and an assist in Morocco's historic run. \n Bruno Fernandes (MUN) \n Man Utd's Portuguese star ended the tournament with the joint-most assists, setting up three goals in only four appearances. Having also scored two goals, only Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe beat his five overall goal involvements.\u00a0 \n Mateo Kovacic (CHE) \n He played the most minutes of any outfield Premier League player at the World Cup, helping Croatia - a country with a population of less than four million - finish third. An honourable mention goes to  Casemiro , too, who was superb for Brazil. \n Ivan Perisic (TOT) \n An assist in the third-place\u00a0play-off\u00a0helped Perisic move level with Fernandes on three for the most in the tournament. His goal in the last 16 was the 10th World Cup goal of his career, breaking Davor Suker's Croatian national record. \n Alexis Mac Allister (BHA) \n What a tournament for  Brighton & Hove Albion 's 23-year-old. He emerged as a key player for Argentina and produced a wonderful assist in the final.\u00a0 \n Julian Alvarez (MCI) \n Manchester City 's striker was the third-highest scorer in the tournament, scoring four times for champions Argentina at just 22 years of age. \n",

He has returned in each of his last three Premier League matches and is first amongst midfielders for creativity in the ICT index. He has averaged 6.4 points per match against Southampton and has returned in four of his last five meetings with them. \n Lee Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n Man City at home to Southampton this weekend is the standout fixture of the week. Both  De Bruyne  and  Phil Foden  (\u00a38.1m) look like great picks. \n However,  Jack Grealish  (\u00a36.8m) is arguably playing some of the best football of his career at the moment. He was unlucky not to return in Gameweek 8 and his second-biggest FPL haul came against Southampton in 2021/22 Fantasy, when he registered a goal, two assists and two bonus, totalling 15 points. I think he could be this week's top-scoring player outside of Haaland. \n Ben Crabtree\u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n I think  Chelsea  will win comfortably  against Wolverhampton Wanderers , with  Raheem Sterling  (\u00a310.0m) being among the goals. I fancy him for two returns this Gameweek. \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n I'm tipping  Foden  to have a big weekend after his night off in Europe this midweek. He has the form linking up with Haaland and opponents Southampton are yet to keep a clean sheet this season. \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n I'm sticking with the Haaland fixture and will be looking at  De Bruyne  to go big after his rest. \n Pras ( @Pras_fpl ) \n I reckon  Wilfried Zaha  (\u00a37.3m) will haul  against Leeds United \u00a0on Sunday.  Crystal Palace  look a great attacking side, who were unlucky to lose to Chelsea last week. \n Zaha is the focal point of the attack, on penalties and therefore my tip for the highest points scorer in Gameweek 10. \n See:\u00a0 Your essential FPL tips for Gameweek 10 \n GW10 deadline: 13:30 BST, Sat 8 Oct \n",

The lead was doubled seven minutes later by  Ilkay Gundogan  after a blocked shot had fallen to him. \n Grealish made it 4-1 with his first home league goal for City since 2021. \n A fourth victory in a row for City, their best run of the season, was also a 100th Premier League home win for  Pep Guardiola , and gives them 64 points, while an eighth away defeat of the campaign leaves Liverpool with 42 points, seven from fourth place. \n \n \n \n Title race \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Position \n Pos \n \n Club \n \n Played \n Pl \n \n GD \n \n Points \n Pts \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Manchester City \n MCI \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +61\n\n \n 89 \n \n \n \n 2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Arsenal \n ARS \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +45\n\n \n 84 \n \n \n \n \n \n View More \n \n Brighton and Brentford provide thriller \n Two teams vying for unlikely European qualification shared a six-goal thriller at the Amex Stadium as  Brighton & Hove Albion  came from behind three times to prevent  Brentford  taking their sixth place. \n \n \n \n \n \n BHA \n \n \n \n \n 3 - 3 \n \n BRE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Brentford went ahead through  Pontus Jansson \u2019s header, but  Kaoru Mitoma  latched on to  Jason Steele \u2019s long ball to lob in Brighton\u2019s equaliser.

        "text": "\n The Scout analyses the strategies of 2022/23  Fantasy Premier League  champion Ali Jahangirov, so that other managers can learn from the best. \n Using your first Wildcard late \n Jahangirov puts one of the key turning points of his season down to his late playing of the first Wildcard. He played it in Gameweek 12 alongside 260,182 other managers.\u00a0 \n \"That's a strategy I'm trying to follow every season because the later you use your first Wildcard, it means the later you can possibly use your second Wildcard,\" he says. \n \"Once you ignore the temptation of using it in the first two, three or four Gameweeks, you [can] plan accordingly. You simply act like there is no Wildcard. Just be cautious with your transfers, plan ahead and ignore the price rises. \n \"A lot of people Wildcard early just to catch up those price rises, but having a squad value of \u00a3106million doesn't really get you up the ranks. You can have a good squad value, but still be really down in the ranks, so you have to pick your battles.\" \n Save chips for Blanks and Doubles \n Jahangirov\u2019s decision to play his chips in Double Gameweeks also proved to be a key factor behind his success. \n This season\u2019s FPL champion believes that managers should target the upside of Doubles and play their chips when players have two fixtures.\u00a0 \n \"I'm just waiting for Double Gameweeks and Blank Gameweeks to come in because that's when they're most useful,\" explains Jahangirov. \"I tend to go for an upside when using a Free Hit chip and I'm trying to navigate Blank Gameweeks without a Free Hit. \n \"You have a higher upside [if you] go for Free Hit in a Double Gameweek and use a Bench Boost in another Double Gameweek. I also want to use my Triple Captain chip in a Double Gameweek as well.\" \n Jahangirov also believes in the strategy of using the Bench Boost chip just after managers have played their Wildcard.\u00a0 \n \"Wildcard two and a Bench Boost is the most popular combination of two chips to use in consecutive Gameweeks. I usually go with a Wildcard and then Bench Boost.\" \n Not Triple Captaining Haaland \n Jahangirov went against a lot of managers by not handing the Triple Captain chip to  Erling Haaland  in Gameweek 20 when 520,778 managers did. The champion handed  Marcus Rashford  the Triple Captain armband based on the additional points midfielders can gain over forwards.\u00a0 \n See:  Jahangirov's Double Gameweek 22 team \n \"Marcus Rashford was playing two games at home and against weaker opponents, and he was firing after the World Cup. I like to Triple Captain a midfielder because of the clean sheet points and more points for a goal. \n \"The [points] hauls are usually easier to get with the midfielder rather than [forwards]. Haaland needs to score a hat-trick in order to get 17 points. Whereas Rashford can score a brace and end up with 16. \n \"[With] appearance points in another game which is two or three points, you'll end up with 19 or 20 points. \n \"So I usually like to go with the midfielder for the Triple Captaincy just for a higher ceiling.\" \n By holding his first Wildcard and playing his remaining chips carefully across the Doubles in the second half of the season, Jahangirov ensured he maximised the chips. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 FPL champion: I thought I'd lost it on the final day Part 2:\u00a0 FPL champion: The one thing I changed to win title Part 3:  FPL champion's tips: Be flexible with your Gameweek 1 squad Part 5:  FPL champion's tips: Getting the most from budget enablers Part 6:\u00a0 FPL champion\u2019s tips: Differential captains can pay off Part 7:  FPL champion\u2019s tips: Limit hits to Blanks and Double Gameweeks \n",

        "text": "\n Ahead of Saturday's Championship playoff final, Luton Town reporter Mike Simmonds profiles some of the key figures in their quest to become the 51st club to play in the Premier League. \n Manager: Rob Edwards \n It's been quite the season for the 40-year-old who left Forest Green Rovers in the summer after winning League Two to join Luton\u2019s fiercest rivals Watford. \n Despite initial promises of being backed \"through hell or high water\", he lasted just 11 matches in total before being sacked by the Hornets, but he wasn\u2019t out of work for long, taking over at Kenilworth Road once  Nathan Jones  had departed for  Southampton  in November. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Although he lost his first contest at Middlesbrough, he soon had the fans on his side with a reign that has been nothing short of magnificent, masterminding the Hatters to 14 wins from his 25 league matches in charge. \n Edwards also enabled them to win their maiden EFL playoff match when defeating Sunderland in the semi-final second leg and is now determined to be the first Luton manager to lead them to the top flight since David Pleat in 1982. \n Tom Lockyer (DEF) \n It\u2019s crazy to think the Wales international wasn\u2019t even in the team at the start of the season. Not selected in the opening four matches, the defender finally got his chance in a 2-0 away win at Swansea and simply hasn\u2019t looked back since. \n Playing in the centre of a back three, the 26-year-old has become a firm crowd favourite and after delivering some magnificent displays, his efforts at Blackpool living long in the memory, was deservedly named in the Championship Team of the Year. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n He has also become a threat at the other end for the first time in his career, scoring three goals in his last four outings, his most prolific spell thus far. \n Marvelous Nakamba (MID) \n The Zimbabwe international was brought in on-loan from  Aston Villa  in the January transfer window and he is already being talked about as the best loan signing in the club\u2019s history. \n Playing the holding role to a tee, the former Vitesse Arnhem and Club Brugge midfielder has solidified the Hatters and proved to be just the signing they needed to push on for the playoffs, barely conceding any goals in open play when he has been on the pitch. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n With his own song to the tune of the Tequila by the Champs, Town fans would love to see him back as a Luton player in the top flight next season. \n Carlton Morris (FWD) \n Town\u2019s top scorer was brought in for a club-record fee by the Hatters in the summer to add what was seen as the final piece of the jigsaw. Although not prolific at his former clubs, the ex-Norwich City youngster scored a terrific solo goal for Barnsley against Luton at Kenilworth Road last year which alerted the attention of former boss Jones. \n He was up and running on his fifth appearance with a fine finish against Swansea and has taken off since then. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Capable of scoring from anywhere on the pitch, with any part of his body, Morris has netted close-range efforts, long-range strikes, headers, right foot, left foot and even a penalty too. \n All of which has seen him become the first Luton forward to score 20 goals in the second tier since the legendary Brian Stein back in the 1981/82 season, when the Hatters coincidentally last won promotion to the top flight. \n Luton News sports editor Mike Simmonds has covered the club home and away for over a decade.  @LutonNews_LTFC \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Coventry's long road to the playoff final Part 2:  Coventry's key men Part 3:  How Luton fell far and rose high again \n",

As the table below shows, United are facing fewer shots and are reducing the Expected Goals Against (xGA) when Casemiro plays.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n Man Utd's defensive comparison \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n Without Casemiro \n With Casemiro \n \n \n \n \n Shots faced/90 \n 15.7 \n 9.0 \n \n \n xGA/90 \n 1.61 \n 0.83 \n \n \n \n Almost all of Casemiro\u2019s contributions take place between both penalty boxes, within a corridor that is the width of those areas down the centre of the pitch.\u00a0He is rarely drawn out of position. \n In possession he drops in to receive passes, or to take a marker with him that creates space for others. Off the ball he focuses on regains and protecting the centre-backs behind him. \n He produced an outstanding individual performance in the  1-1 draw at Chelsea , highlighting his role in the team. \n Interestingly, Casemiro\u2019s only touch inside the  Chelsea  box was his brilliant headed equaliser, one of just three touches in the opposition area he has made in 619 minutes of action. \n \n \n \ud83d\udca5  @Casemiro 's first United goal couldn't have come at a better time! \u2764\ufe0f #MUFC  ||  #CHEMUN \n\u2014 Manchester United (@ManUtd)  October 22, 2022 \n \n Casemiro was also in fantastic form during United\u2019s  2-0 win at home to Tottenham Hotspur . \n That night he won four tackles, made two interceptions, and also claimed 10 ball recoveries for Ten Hag\u2019s side. \n When the time is right, Casemiro will leave his station to recover possession for his team. \n Smart acquisition \n Keeping the ball well, he also feeds a lot of sharp forward passes into team-mates ahead of him. \n In his primary role as a ball winner, the Brazilian has also excelled. \n Just six starts into his Premier League career, Casemiro leads the United rankings for most of the key defensive metrics. \n Casemiro's defensive ranking* \n \n \n \n Stat \n Per 90 \n MUN rank \n \n \n \n \n Ball recoveries \n 7.71 \n 1st \n \n \n Possession won \n 4.22 \n 1st \n \n \n Interceptions \n 1.60 \n 1st \n \n \n Tackles won \n 1.89 \n 1st \n \n \n \n *Min five starts \n Casemiro experienced his first below-par performance in the  3-1 defeat at Aston Villa  last weekend. \n United\u2019s shape was pulled around too easily that day and, as a collective, they struggled to cope with Villa\u2019s aggressive counter-pressing. \n On Sunday they face  Fulham , who have been fantastic in central midfield this season, thanks in part to a strong partnership between  Harrison Reed  and  Joao Palhinha . \n Reed is suspended for this match, and his absence might just hand United the initiative they seek inside the middle third. \n With the world-class Casemiro in the starting XI, do not be surprised if United dominate that midfield battle at Craven Cottage. \n Also in this series \n See:  How Villa have embraced Emery's style of play \n",

        "text": "\n With several expensive defenders struggling for big returns, The Scout's panel of  Fantasy Premier League  experts debate if it is time to go with cheaper alternatives, such as  William Saliba (\u00a35.0m) , the only defender among the 13 highest-scoring players in FPL.\u00a0 \n What the experts say \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n I wouldn't clear out all your premium defenders. Under Graham Potter,  Reece James (\u00a36.0m)  can get double-digit hauls.  Joao Cancelo (\u00a37.2m) , too. But, I wouldn't back  Liverpool  for clean sheets for the next two weeks. So if you\u2019ve got  Trent Alexander-Arnold (\u00a37.3m) , he's probably a sell, given he's not producing the attacking returns either. Keep:  James, Cancelo Sell:  Alexander-Arnold \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n I still think the likes of James and Cancelo offer excellent potential at both ends.  Kieran Trippier (\u00a35.5m)  is also offering premium-defender potential at a fraction of the price and has many routes to points even without clean sheets. Keep:  James, Cancelo, Trippier Sell:  Liverpool defenders \n Ben Crabtree\u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n \"Big at the back\" isn't dead, it's sleeping. Teams challenging for something at the run-in tend to tighten up. It only takes Liverpool to sort their defence out and you have Alexander-Arnold plus  Andrew Robertson (\u00a36.7m)  becoming two of the best-value players in the game. Don't pick four expensive defenders now, but don't rule it out for later in the season. Keep:  Some premium defenders \n Sam Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n As someone who doubled up on the  Manchester City  defence, the era of investing heavily in defence is coming to an end. This in part is due to the lack of clean sheets this season, but also to do with the attacking assets.  \n Normally, I like to invest in the City defence for the clean sheets. However,  Ederson (\u00a35.5m)  is only the fifth-highest scoring goalkeeper and while Cancelo is the second-highest scoring defender, by not owning either, I can use my precious City spots for their attacking assets who are scoring goals for fun. This theory is strengthened by Cancelo having only scored one point more than Trippier but being \u00a31.7m more expensive. Sell:  Ederson, Cancelo \n Paul Gee ( @FpLPaulGee ) \n This year we need to be flexible. Liverpool's defence at the moment looks terrible. However, Cancelo, Trippier and James   are all must picks at the moment. So I'd say two or three premiums is a must, but be prepared for more, especially when Liverpool's fixtures change for the better and when Man City blank in Gameweek 12. Keep:  James, Cancelo, Trippier \n Gianni Buttice ( @GianniButtice ) \n James and Cancelo   will prove exceptional FPL assets this season. We haven't seen too many clean sheets from last season's top four, but I expect that to change soon. Keep:  James, Cancelo \n Pras ( @Pras_fpl ) \n We should not be knee-jerking and ejecting some of the best players in the game. Yes, Liverpool and specifically Alexander-Arnold look defensively suspect, but James, Trippier and Cancelo   still offer a fantastic route to points at both ends of the pitch . \n  Moreover, we need to think about team structure. If there were budget constraints, for example if a manager wanted to go three premium players, there is merit to this budget-defenders strategy. At the moment one or two premium defenders is optimal. Keep:  James, Cancelo, Trippier Sell:  Alexander-Arnold \n Jamie Pigott ( @Futbolislifefpl ) \n \"Big at the back\" isn't fully dead but there's a middle ground to find.  \n It's certainly getting more difficult to justify Alexander-Arnold. But I like using a smaller portion of my transfers on defenders. So James, Cancelo, Trippier all still offer great value, can return at both ends and are set-and-forget options. With  Erling Haaland (\u00a312.2m)  the standout captaincy option most weeks, there's less reason to shoehorn a second or third premium player, leaving us with plenty of budget to invest in defence. Keep:  James, Cancelo, Trippier Sell:  Alexander-Arnold \n",

When Calvert-Lewin has been unavailable for Dyche the figure drops to 18.6 per cent.\u00a0 \n With Calvert-Lewin as their focal point Everton have been able to make those forward passes stick with greater regularity.\u00a0 \n Feeding off second balls, flicks and lay-offs, it has helped the likes of  Dwight McNeil ,  Alex Iwobi  and  Abdoulaye Doucoure  make more of an impact, too.\u00a0 \n All three players have scored in the last two fixtures.\u00a0 \n Dyche\u2019s brand of football suits Calvert-Lewin and in turn the rest of the side when he is fit and available.\u00a0 \n Everton\u2019s shots and expected goals per 90 minutes have been considerably higher when Dyche has used the striker, compared with when Calvert-Lewin played under Lampard.\u00a0 \n Everton with Calvert-Lewin 22/23 \n \n \n \n Manager \n xG \n Shots \n Long pass % \n \n \n \n \n Lampard \n 0.9 \n 7.5 \n 14.1% \n \n \n Dyche \n 1.7 \n 13.6 \n 21.3% \n \n \n \n A different test for City \n The challenge for Dyche and his players will be to trying to impose their style on an opponent with as much quality as City.\u00a0 \n In his first match in charge, a  1-0 win at home to then leaders Arsenal , they did succeed in this, turning the contest into the type of match which suited them.\u00a0 \n Everton unsettled the Gunners\u2019 rhythm on the ball, gained territory quickly, and asked awkward questions of the visiting defenders.\u00a0 \n From a tactical perspective, Dyche will want to test the resolve of City\u2019s defensive players and take them outside of their comfort zone.\u00a0 \n This will mean firing as many high balls, channel passes and crosses in the direction of Calvert-Lewin as they can.\u00a0 \n As the table below shows, City\u2019s defenders are not accustomed to experiencing a high volume of aerial duels.\u00a0 \n Guardiola\u2019s defenders are strong in the air, but cracks may appear if they are forced into dealing with a stream of crosses or longer balls.\u00a0 \n DCL v City defence per 90 22/23 \n \n \n \n Player \n Aerial duels \n Aerial duels won \n \n \n \n \n Calvert-Lewin \n 10.6 \n 5.0 \n \n \n Dias \n 3.3 \n 2.1 \n \n \n Ake \n 2.8 \n 1.7 \n \n \n Stones \n 2.5 \n 1.7 \n \n \n Akanji \n 2.3 \n 1.0 \n \n \n Walker \n 1.6 \n 1.1 \n \n \n \n Calvert-Lewin is the division\u2019s strongest target man in the air, so containing his threat is sure to be an examination for them.\u00a0 \n Top forwards for aerial success 22/23 \n \n \n \n Forward \n Aerial duels won/90 \n \n \n \n \n Calvert-Lewin \n 4.99 \n \n \n Mitrovic \n 4.61 \n \n \n Moore \n 4.56 \n \n \n Toney \n 3.32 \n \n \n Adams \n 2.75 \n \n \n \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 How Jorginho has benefited from defensive change Part 2:\u00a0 Harrison and Rodrigo can put Leeds on the front foot Part 3:  Fabinho finding form at right time to stop Maddison \n",

Steele has 17 points in three matches, keeping a clean sheet on two of those occasions. \n Kieran Trippier (NEW) \u00a36.1m Newcastle United \u2019s right-back offers many routes to returns against Man Utd and  West Ham United . Trippier has combined a goal and six assists with 14 clean sheets and 31 bonus points on his way to the top of the defender standings.\u00a0 \n Luke Shaw (MUN) \u00a35.2m Man Utd\u2019s left-back is the most-bought defender in the Gameweek, earning 110,000+ new owners.

Chilwell has 19 points over his previous three appearances, returning one goal, one assist and a clean sheet. \n Bruno Fernandes (MUN) \u00a39.6m The Portuguese totalled 31 points over Man Utd\u2019s Double Gameweek 20 and Double Gameweek 22, just a single point behind  Rashford  (\u00a37.3m).

Maddison\u2019s 58 shots and 48 key passes are both team-leading totals for the Foxes this season. \n Marcus Rashford (MUN) \u00a37.3m Man Utd\u2019s England star has averaged 8.1 points per start since the season resumed. Rashford has 10 goals and two assists in 12 appearances in that period, with his 94 points joint-top among all players in Fantasy. \n Kaoru Mitoma (BHA) \u00a35.5m The Japanese has been one of the most reliable players in Fantasy this term, blanking in just three of his 13 starts for Roberto De Zerbi. Mitoma has returned all three of his double-figure hauls for 2022/23 in his previous seven appearances.\u00a0 \n Alexis Mac Allister (BHA) \u00a35.5m A recent move to a No 10 role has lifted the attacker's goal threat. Mac Allister\u2019s totals of 15 shots, 10 shots in the box and six shots on target in his last four matches were all more than any other Brighton player. \n Erling Haaland (MCI) \u00a312.0m Despite having a single fixture in Double Gameweek 29, Man City\u2019s Norwegian remains among the best armband options.

There are three standout areas to work on. \n Set-piece goals \n Since the start of last season, the Foxes have conceded 24 set-piece goals, with 19 of those coming from corners, the worst return of all Premier League clubs. \n Goals let in from corners since Aug '21 \n \n \n \n Team \n Goals conceded \n \n \n \n \n Leicester \n 19 \n \n \n Everton \n 17 \n \n \n Southampton \n 15 \n \n \n Brentford \n 14 \n \n \n \n So far in 2022/23, they have leaked five goals from set-plays. Of these, three have been conceded from corners, one from a long throw and another from a direct free-kick. \n Rodgers likes to set his team up with a mix of zonal defenders along the six-yard box and man-to-man markers elsewhere in the penalty area. \n But his players have lacked physicality and awareness, and struggled with marking. \n Opponents have sensed this weakness, often crowding the six-yard box to apply additional pressure. \n Leicester\u2019s Achilles heel has been near-post deliveries from corners. These have cost them 10 goals since the start of last season. \n They will hope the arrival of set-piece coach Lars Knudsen earlier this month makes a difference. \n Leicester goals let in from corners 22/23 \n \n \n \n Type of goal \n Total \n \n \n \n \n Near post \n 10 \n \n \n Short \n 3 \n \n \n No reaction to second ball \n 3 \n \n \n Lost headed duel centre of box \n 2 \n \n \n Far post \n 1 \n \n \n \n Making possession count \n Rodgers\u2019 side have played some attractive passing football this season. \n Comfortable on the ball, they have moved it around nicely, and this was the case for long periods of their loss at  Spurs . \n In fact, Leicester have produced 107 sequences of 10 or more passes, which is second only to  Manchester City . \n Subsequently, they have made the second-highest number of successful passes in the division. \n But too much of that possession has been in the defensive and middle thirds, without penetration. \n Successful passes v threat 2022/23 \n \n \n \n Most succ. passes \n Fewest shots in opp. box \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n 4,602 \n BOU \n 29 \n \n \n LEI \n 3,202 \n LEI \n 41 \n \n \n LIV \n 3,150 \n AVL \n 41 \n \n \n ARS \n 3,097 \n WOL \n 44 \n \n \n TOT \n 2,899 \n CRY \n 46 \n \n \n \n Leicester have been taking extra touches and overcomplicating passages of play, finding it difficult to get in behind the opposition. \n AFC Bournemouth  are the only side to have had fewer touches in the opposition box, and they are also the only team to have mustered fewer shots inside the penalty area. \n Moving forward, Rodgers and his players might want to look at producing more counters or direct attacks that catch defenders off guard. \n Sharper movement ahead of the ball would also help to create better goalscoring opportunities for the likes of  Harvey Barnes ,  Jamie Vardy  and  Patson Daka . \n Toughening up the mentality\u00a0 \n Leicester have also frequently given up the lead this season. \n They scored first against  Spurs ,  Brighton & Hove Albion ,  Southampton  and  Brentford , only to collect a total of one point from those four matches. \n The Foxes have conceded too many goals in clusters. \n It is vital they change this habit of letting their confidence drop following setbacks. \n Ahead of a high-pressure encounter, there is plenty for the players and coaching staff to work on. \n",

This fits well with his flexible, strategically fluid style of in-game management. \n Under  Thomas Tuchel ,  Chelsea  usually lined up in a 3-4-2-1 or 3-4-1-2 formation, but from the start and middle of matches, Potter will ask his players to fit into a wide range of shapes. \n During 2021/22, he used 13 different systems of play at  Brighton & Hove Albion , the most of any Premier League head coach. His preferred set-up was 3-5-2, but this only featured in 23.7 per cent of Brighton's matches. \n Potter likes to keep rival managers guessing when it comes to the tactical structure of his team. \n Most formations used 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Manager \n Different formations \n Main formation \n Times used \n \n \n \n \n Potter \n 13 \n 3-5-2 \n 9 \n \n \n Rodgers \n 10 \n 4-2-3-1 \n 16 \n \n \n Smith \n 10 \n 4-2-3-1 \n 11 \n \n \n Hasenhuttl \n 8 \n 4-4-2 \n 28 \n \n \n \n In Potter's first match in charge of Chelsea, a 1-1 draw with RB Salzburg in the UEFA Champions League, we witnessed some of his early ideas. \n The use of  Raheem Sterling  as a left-wing back will have shocked some observers, but at Brighton he would often put  Leandro Trossard , a similar attacking player, in that role, too. \n Sterling was not inhibited by this unusual role, enjoying eight touches in the opposition box and putting his team ahead. \n Possession won in final and middle third \n \n \n \n Club \n Poss. won in final third \n Club \n Poss. won middle third \n \n \n \n \n LIV \n 287 \n LIV\u00a0 \n 1106 \n \n \n MCI \n 240 \n LEE \n 1037 \n \n \n BHA \n 219 \n BHA \n 1003 \n \n \n CHE \n 181 \n CHE \n 983 \n \n \n \n Pressing with organisation and detail also forms a key part of Potter's philosophy. \n He likes to set up traps, especially when opponents pass out from the back. \n So, keep a lookout for changes to the way Chelsea defend inside the opposition half. \n Central midfielders and wide attackers will be asked to step forward and pressurise opponents with greater frequency. \n After seven rounds of matches, Brighton are joint leaders for shots from high turnovers, with 10. Potter's new team, Chelsea, boast just five by comparison. \n Chelsea's upcoming opponents must be wary of this change of tact when they keep possession inside their own half. \n Goals to come? \n Brighton had a reputation for creating lots of opportunities, but scoring relatively few goals. \n Their 8.9 per cent conversion rate was the lowest of all 17 sides who did not get relegated last term. \n They also ranked 16th for the number of shots they attempted per goal, way behind Chelsea (sixth), who needed an average of 3.6 fewer shots to find the back of the net compared to Brighton. \n Most shots per goal 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Club \n Shots per goal \n \n \n \n \n Leicester \n 7.0 \n \n \n Spurs \n 7.1 \n \n \n Man City \n 7.2 \n \n \n West Ham \n 7.5 \n \n \n Liverpool \n 7.7 \n \n \n Chelsea \n 7.8 \n \n \n Brighton \n 11.4 \n \n \n \n Working with better finishers at Stamford Bridge, there is a hope that Potter's formula will yield far more goals at Chelsea. \n This is an exciting opportunity for Potter, who has rightly been recognised as one of the brightest coaches in the division. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:\u00a0 How O'Neil's changes have lifted AFC Bournemouth Part 3:\u00a0 How Ten Hag's short-term planning has revived Man Utd Part 4:  Bowen and Antonio can provide missing spark for West Ham Part 5:  Gundogan and Eriksen battle key to derby success Part 6:  Xhaka relishing more freedom at Arsenal \n",

Kevin De Bruyne (\u00a312.2m) looks the next best alternative, but  Crystal Palace  can be a tough nut to crack.\u00a0 \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n AFC Bournemouth will go to Anfield and sit in, minimising space in behind for Salah and Luis Diaz (\u00a38.0m). With Thiago (\u00a35.3m) missing, Liverpool will find the Cherries hard to break down. So I'm going with the man in form at  Arsenal ,  Jesus . \n The Brazilian got a huge 19-point haul in Gameweek 2 and has been unlucky not to bring home double-digit points in the other two matches he's played. He's been outstanding.\u00a0 \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n I'm really torn this week. I don't own Harry Kane (\u00a311.4m), otherwise I would captain him.

However, while Liverpool are out of form, Salah is still returning. It's between the two, but I am leaning towards  Jesus  at the moment.\u00a0 \n Sonaldo ( @FPL_Sonaldo ) \n Erling Haaland (\u00a311.7m), De Bruyne, Salah and Jesus present themselves as great captaincy options this week with solid home fixtures. While you could pick any of the above, I try not to get too differential with the captaincy picks, particularly this early in the season.  Salah  at home to a defensively weak AFC Bournemouth is a straightforward as it gets.\u00a0 \n Jamie Pigott\u00a0 ( @Futbolislifefpl ) \n I can't overlook  Salah  at home to AFC Bournemouth. it feels like a prime fixture to target. I'm not worried about Liverpool's recent form as they'll be motivated to turn it around and change the narrative. \n \n \n \n Paul Gee ( @FPLPaulGee ) \n It has to be  Salah . AFC Bournemouth look they are going to be the whipping boys. Haaland is a good alternative as he looks nailed on after limited minutes in the midweek friendly against Barcelona. \n Kelly Somers\u00a0 ( @KellySomers ) \n If I owned Kane I\u2019d be tempted by him at  Nottingham Forest  but, as I don\u2019t, it\u2019s  Salah  because of his incredible record against AFC Bournemouth. I\u2019m expecting a response at home to the promoted side and his record of eight goals and one assist in his last six league meetings with the Cherries is too hard to ignore. \n Nick\u00a0 ( @WGTA_Nick )\u00a0\u00a0 \n Liverpool may not be at their barnstorming best right now but  Salah  has still been on the scoresheet and I expect them to come back firing against AFC Bournemouth at home, which is the perfect fixture for the Reds to find some form.\u00a0 \n Pras ( @Pras_fpl ) \n Despite Liverpool's recent struggles, a home contest against a promoted team is too good to ignore.  Salah  is the standout captain this week. \n While his rivals Haaland, Kane and Jesus are also on penalties, what separates the Egyptian is the extra point for a goal and a likely clean sheet point. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  GW4 Captains: De Bruyne to challenge popular trio Part 2:\u00a0 Scout Selection: Best FPL team for Gameweek 4 \n Don't forget the Gameweek 4 deadline is 11:00 BST on Saturday 27 August. \n",

Cancelo boasts a significant goal threat  against West Ham United . His total of 81 shots in 2021/22 was more than any team-mate. \n Reece James (CHE) \u00a36.0m \n Chelsea's wing-back travels to Everton  on the back of some outstanding away form last term.

He is a good fit to replace  Jorginho , who  joined Arsenal this week . \n During his time with Benfica, no other midfielder in Portugal could match Fernandez's 92.8 accurate passes per 90 minutes. \n Prompting at the base of  Graham Potter \u2019s midfield, he will also look to provide a stream of long diagonal passes towards the flanks. \n He did this to great effect in the World Cup final against France, regularly picking out  Angel Di Maria . \n In the Primeira Liga he averaged a division-high 10.4 accurate long passes per 90 for Benfica. \n During his debut UEFA Champions League (UCL) group stage, Fernandez was second only to Toni Kroos for successful long passes. \n UCL's best long passers 2022/23 \n \n \n \n Player \n Most accurate long passes \n \n \n \n \n Toni Kroos (Real Madrid) \n 48 \n \n \n Enzo Fernandez (Benfica) \n 32 \n \n \n Josip Misic (Dinamo Zagreb) \n 29 \n \n \n Hans Vanaken (Club Brugge) \n 28 \n \n \n Rodri (Man City) \n 25 \n \n \n \n When Chelsea's attacking full-backs  Reece James  and  Ben Chilwell  return to full fitness they will benefit greatly from Fernandez's tremendous passing range. \n Mykhailo Mudryk  will also relish playing with his fellow January recruit, racing on to his forward passes and using his pace to run in behind opposition full-backs. \n That combination will certainly stretch Premier League defences. \n All-round versatility \n Potter likes to work with versatile players and Fernandez certainly fits that mould. \n He can sit in front of the back four but will also squeeze up to regain possession. \n In the World Cup final, he showed this combative feature, attempting 10 tackles during the match. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Enzo Fernandez is combative, making 10 tackles in the World Cup final\n             \n \n Fernandez is also comfortable travelling with the ball at his feet and can break the lines with a dribble or pass. \n Only two players in the Portuguese top flight have averaged more ball carries this term. \n Primeira Liga most ball carries 22/23 \n \n \n \n Player \n Ball carries/90 \n \n \n \n \n Matheus Reis (Sporting) \n 23 \n \n \n Goncalo Inacio (Sporting) \n 22 \n \n \n Enzo Fernandez (Benfica) \n 21 \n \n \n Nicolas Otamendi (Benfica) \n 19 \n \n \n David Neres (Benfica) \n 19 \n \n \n \n Chelsea have been impressive in keeping the ball this season.

        "text": "\n A much-loved European legend,  Gianluca Vialli  brought continental style, skill and success to the Premier League as both a player and manager, showing the way for the Italians who have lit up the competition after him. \n After achieving the rare treble of winning the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup and UEFA Cup Winners\u2019 Cup, Vialli\u00a0took his winning habit to  Chelsea . \n His arrival at Stamford Bridge\u00a0in the summer of 1996 as a European champion with Juventus was a significant moment in the history of the Premier League. \n It represented the beginning of the internationalisation of the competition as an attractive destination for the world's elite players. \n On the pitch, he produced 21 goals and 11 assists in 58 Premier League appearances. And when he became the league\u2019s first  Italian manager , he led the Blues to five trophies in two-and-a-half years. \n Vialli\u2019s journey to Stamford Bridge began 32 years earlier on 9 July 1964 in Cremona, where he was raised alongside his four siblings. \n Successive promotions \n He rose quickly through the youth system at Cremonese, eventually making his senior debut with them in Serie C1, aged just 16. \n \n \n Resterai un esempio indelebile della nostra essenza, Luca  #Vialli  \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udd18\ud83d\udd34  pic.twitter.com/zwqmLHyQna \n\u2014 U.S. Cremonese (@USCremonese)  January 6, 2023 \n \n Helping Cremonese win two promotions, reaching Serie A for the first time since their maiden campaign in 1929/30, Vialli caught the eye of Sampdoria, who signed him in 1984. \n A year later he made his Italy debut, going on to play in all four of their matches at FIFA World Cup 1986. \n Vialli would play at the tournament again four years later and help his side finish third. Overall, he won 59 caps and scored 16 times for his country. \n Glittering success \n During his eight seasons with Sampdoria, Vialli\u2019s goals helped deliver the club\u2019s only Serie A title in 1990/91, while he also won the UEFA Cup Winners\u2019 Cup. \n \n \n \ud83d\udc94 Ciao Luca.  pic.twitter.com/8KAo9BsYaC \n\u2014 U.C.

He went on to oversee victory in the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid. \n In 1998/99, Vialli secured a third-placed finish - the club\u2019s best performance for 29 years - and in 1999/2000 he won his second FA Cup, before masterminding a triumph over  Manchester United  in the Charity Shield. \n \n \n \n You\u2019ll be missed by so many.

Many Chelsea fans feel his arrival and tenure laid the foundations for the success that has followed ever since. \n The connection was mutual, with Vialli continuing to live in southwest London.\u00a0 \n \"I\u2019ve been quite lucky during my career because I\u2019ve played for only four clubs and every time I\u2019ve managed to fall in love,\" he said, when reflecting upon his career. \"With Chelsea fans, I had a fantastic relationship. We fell in love with each other. They never stopped encouraging me and when I became the manager the love and the passion went on.\" \n It was perhaps fitting that his final European triumph came just a few miles away, with Vialli working as chief of delegation for the Italy squad who won the 2020 European Championship at Wembley Stadium. \n",

        "text": "\n Signings go a long way to turning a good team into a great team, and the first 10 in  Jose Mourinho 's first spell as  Chelsea  manager proved to be pivotal. \n As the Premier League celebrates its 30th anniversary, we take a look at how the players Mourinho brought in took the Blues to another level.\u00a0 \n Paulo Ferreira \n The versatile Portuguese defender became the first player to follow Mourinho from Porto and was integral to their first two title wins, going on to spend nine seasons with the club. Following his retirement, Ferreira took up a role as loan player technical coach and was also a club ambassador, before departing Stamford Bridge earlier this year. \n Alex \n Despite arriving from Santos in 2004, the Brazilian defender would have to wait another three years to make his debut for Chelsea, having spent that time on loan at PSV. A free-kick expert, Alex helped the club to claim the title in 2009/10. He announced his retirement in 2016. \n Arjen Robben \n The Dutchman was one of the most promising wingers in European football following his switch from PSV and would become a fan-favourite during his three seasons with Chelsea. After winning two PL winner's medals, he departed in 2007 and would enjoy a stellar career with Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. Robben retired for a second time in 2021, following a brief spell at Groningen, the club where he started. \n Mateja Kezman \n Much was expected of Kezman following a prolific spell with PSV Eindhoven, but the forward managed only four Premier League goals in his one season at Stamford Bridge. He did, however, net the winner in the League Cup final to earn Mourinho his first piece of silverware with the club. Kezman retired in 2012 and became a football agent. \n Didier Drogba \n Signed from Marseille, the Ivorian would eventually go on to become one of the competition's most dominant strikers. He won three titles and two Golden Boots in his first spell at Stamford Bridge, before returning in 2014 to claim a fourth winners' medal when reunited with Mourinho. Drogba ended his playing career in the United States with Montreal Impact and Phoenix Rising before retiring in 2018. \n Tiago \n An often overlooked member of Mourinho's first Chelsea squad, Tiago featured 34 times in the Premier League and was a reliable performer. Following a single season at the club, the midfielder would go on to play for Lyon, Juventus and Atletico Madrid, retiring in 2017. He enjoyed a stint as Atletico Madrid assistant manager in 2017/18, before a short spell as Vitoria Guimaraes manager in 2020. \n Ricardo Carvalho \n Carvalho was another member of Mourinho's Porto side that made the switch to Stamford Bridge in 2004. The Portuguese would play a central role as Chelsea broke numerous defensive records during his debut campaign. After three PL titles, he joined Real Madrid in 2010, before retiring seven years later. Carvalho worked as assistant manager under former Chelsea boss  Andre Villas-Boas  between 2019 and 2021. \n Jiri Jarosik \n A January transfer window signing, Jarosik made 14 appearances before joining Birmingham City on loan for the 2005/06 season. After a loan spell with Celtic, he played for clubs including Real Zaragoza and Sparta Prague, before hanging up his boots in 2015. Jarosik has since forged a successful coaching career, and he is currently manager of FK Teplice. \n Asier Del Horno \n The Spanish left-back joined from Athletic Bilbao in June 2005 and in a brief spell at the club, he made 25 appearances, scoring once. After one season at Stamford Bridge he returned to Spain with Valencia. Del Horno retired in 2012. \n Lassana Diarra \n A bit-part player for Chelsea, the midfielder made 13 Premier League appearances during his three seasons with the Blues. After spells at clubs including  Arsenal , Portsmouth, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, Diarra retired in 2019. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  PL30: The Special One Part 2:  PL30: Chelsea's special 2004/05 title win Part 3:  Test your knowledge of Mourinho's Premier League career \n",

It means Casemiro has scored in back-to-back matches, and has found the net in both of his Premier League meetings with Chelsea.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n MUN \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 1 \n \n CHE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Chelsea then wasted two more big chances,  Kai Havertz  heading wide from an identical position to Mudryk before  Conor Gallagher  missed the target after being played in by  Enzo Fernandez . And again they were made to pay. \n In first-half stoppage time, Casemiro played a sublime no-look pass to  Jadon Sancho , who squared the ball for  Anthony Martial  to tap in. Martial has now been directly involved in six goals in his last five starts against Chelsea.\u00a0 \n The sour note of the first half for Man Utd was  Antony  being taken off on a stretcher with an apparent ankle injury just nine days before their FA Cup final against  Manchester City .  Luke Shaw  was also taken off at half-time. \n See:  Ten Hag on Antony and Shaw injuries \n The second half continued in end-to-end fashion, with  Bruno Fernandes  smashing against the woodwork and  David De Gea  saving from Hall, the 18-year-old left-back who was one of few bright sparks for Chelsea. \n Any Man Utd nerves were put aside in the space of five second-half minutes, when Fernandes won and scored a penalty, given away by  Wesley Fofana , before substitute  Marcus Rashford  struck his first goal since 27 April, capitalising on a Chelsea mistake.\u00a0 \n It makes Rashford\u00a0the first \u00a0Man Utd \u00a0 player to score 30 goals in a season in all competitions since  Robin van Persie  in 2012/13, and the first to net 20 at Old Trafford since  Wayne Rooney  in 2009/10. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Chelsea did get a consolation goal in the 89th minute, ending Man Utd's run of six home matches without conceding when two substitutes combined,  Joao Felix  collecting  Hakim Ziyech 's pass and advancing to score. \n Chelsea remain in 12th, on 43 points, guaranteed to finish the season with their lowest-ever Premier League points tally. \u00a0 \n In extending their unbeaten run against Chelsea to a club-record 11 Premier League matches, Man Utd move on to 72 points and will confirm a third-place finish with a home win over  Fulham  on the final day. \n Final day on Sunday! \n Premier League action returns for one last time on Sunday as 2022/23 comes to a close with 10 matches all kicking off at 16:30 BST. \n All eyes will be on the bottom of the table as we find out who will follow  Southampton  in being relegated. \n Everton ,  Leicester City  and  Leeds United  all have home matches but only one of them can stay up, with Everton the only one of the three with their destiny in their own hands.\u00a0 \n Final-day fixtures \n \n \n \n \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n 5 - 0 \n \n WOL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n AVL \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 1 \n \n BHA \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n BRE \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 0 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n CHE \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 1 \n \n NEW \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n CRY \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 1 \n \n NFO \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n EVE \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 0 \n \n BOU \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n LEE \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 4 \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n LEI \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 1 \n \n WHU \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n MUN \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 1 \n \n FUL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n SOU \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 4 \n \n LIV \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n See:  Relegation battle: What each club need \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at key tactical points and players who can be decisive in Matchweek 19. \n Chelsea \n To get their season back on track, Chelsea must quickly find a cure for their bluntness inside the final third. \n \n \n \n \n \n CHE \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 1 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n The Blues are by some distance the lowest scorers inside the Premier League\u2019s top 10, finding the back of the net just 20 times across their first 16 matches. \n Second-placed  Manchester City , who visit Stamford Bridge on Thursday evening, have notched 44 goals in the same number of matches. \n Lack of a clinical edge \n Finding a way to turn control into clear-cut chances is a matter of priority for head coach  Graham Potter . \n Averaging over 59 per cent of possession, Chelsea spend a lot of time on the ball inside the opposition half, but the bulk of their football is played out in front of rival teams. \n Too many players want the ball to feet instead of making runs in beyond their markers, and collectively they do not display enough sharp or rotational movement. \n This means they find it difficult to pull defenders out of position. \n Last time out in a  1-1 draw at Nottingham Forest  this was particularly evident during a tame second-half display. \n Chelsea's attacking stats 2022/23 \n \n \n \n Statistic \n Total \n PL rank \n \n \n \n \n Shots \n 178 \n 17th \n \n \n Expected goals \n 18.3 \n 15th \n \n \n Big chances \n 27 \n =13th \n \n \n Shots in box \n 124 \n 12th \n \n \n \n While Chelsea have played one match fewer than most teams, their attacking statistics do not make for pleasant reading. \n Firing 11 shots per match on average, creating precious few 'big chances', they rank a lowly 15th for expected goals this term. \n Their xG of 18.3 is a chasm behind the likes of Arsenal (33.32) and Man City (34.29). \n Missing Reece James \n Injuries to wing-backs  Ben Chilwell  and  Reece James  have certainly had a detrimental effect. \n James is especially influential, producing 24 crosses into the box from open play this season, the most of any Blues player, despite featuring in only half of their matches. \n They also miss the England international\u2019s pace and drive. \n Chelsea with James v without James \n \n \n \n Statistic \n With James \n Without James \n \n \n \n \n Matches \n 8 \n 8 \n \n \n Expected goals \n 11.6 \n 6.8 \n \n \n Shots \n 108 \n 70 \n \n \n Points \n 19 \n 6 \n \n \n \n When he works in tandem with  Raheem Sterling , the duo regularly get to the byline or advanced areas of the pitch with fast interchanges. \n Chelsea\u2019s record with and without James is markedly different. \n They have collected 19 of their 25 points in matches that featured the 23-year-old. \n Cesar Azpilicueta  is more accustomed to supporting the wide forward from behind or inside, than creating 2v1 overloads on the outside. \n And with  Marc Cucurella  similar in style on the other flank, Chelsea\u2019s inverted wingers are often forced infield where space is at a premium. \n Key trio \n So much of Chelsea\u2019s attacking play centres around the contributions of Sterling,  Kai Havertz  and  Mason Mount . \n Sterling creates the most chances from open play (22) but this only ranks him 14th in the division, with Mount next in line (14) in joint-57th place. \n Those three players also produce the most attempts on goal, with  Christian Pulisic  the only other player in double figures for shots in the campaign so far. \n 'Big six' clubs' players with 10+ shots \n \n \n \n Team \n Total \n \n \n \n \n Man City \n 10 \n \n \n Man Utd \n 9 \n \n \n Spurs \n 9 \n \n \n Liverpool\u00a0 \n 9 \n \n \n Arsenal \n 8 \n \n \n Chelsea \n 4 \n \n \n \n When you compare the spread of attacking threat Chelsea possess compared to their 'big six' rivals, it is clear that Potter must extract more from other members of his squad. \n Tactically they have lacked dynamism and variety, and not enough individuals are pushing themselves into positions where they can impact the game with a shot or key pass. \n The visit of Man City will sharpen minds and potentially bring the best out of Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. \n But to make a realistic push for a top-four finish, significant improvements to their fluency and creativity have to be made. \n",

However, despite being the second highest-scoring player in the game the Tottenham Hotspur talisman has yet to return an explosive FPL haul.  \n He has returned two double-digit hauls in his last three meetings with Gameweek 11 opponents Everton. He averages 7.36 points per match against the Toffees in the Premier League, so this week could be the week for a big Kane return. If it wasn't for \u00a0Haaland \u00a0I would hand Kane the captain's armband this weekend. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Aston Villa have only scored six goals so far this season and I'm fully expecting a clean sheet for the Chelsea defence.\u00a0 Reece James  (\u00a36.1m) was substituted with an injury concern in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday evening. However, if he is fit then I expect him to come back into the Chelsea team in time to face the shot-shy Villans in Gameweek 11. James also sits third-best among defenders for xGI (Expected Goal Involvement), so potential for returns at both ends of the pitch look on. \n Kelly Somers ( @KellySomers ) \n It will undoubtedly be Haaland who is the top points scorer this weekend, however  Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a38.0m) will likely be second. He plays in an Arsenal team who are full of attacking talent. They will keep creating chances and he is the perfect man to take them. This weekend he faces a Leeds side who have conceded the majority of their chances this season down the centre of the pitch where you will find Jesus.\u00a0 \n Ben Crabtree ( @FCCrab_Dogg ) \n Chelsea's  James  hasn't had a haul yet so far this season. I'm backing him to get an attacking return along with a probable clean sheet against a struggling Aston Villa this weekend, so long as he is fit after the Champions League knock.\u00a0 \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n On current form,  Kane  has the potential to post a big score at home to Everton. He's making a habit of scoring in every game he plays at the moment. Plus he's on penalties. \n Pras ( @Pras_fpl ) \n In a week where last year's top two sides play each other,  Kane  is a good shout. He is yet to blank since Gameweek 1, and looks good for another haul against Everton at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. \n Pranil Sheth\u00a0( @Lateriser12 ) \n Bukayo Saka  (\u00a37.8m) plays a Leeds side who have improved a lot. However, Arsenal's firepower might be too much for them. I expect him to be the highest-scoring player this weekend. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n No team have conceded more shots than Everton over the last six Gameweeks. In reality they have been fortunate not to concede more. I fancy  Kane  to go big this weekend and be the top points scorer.\u00a0 \n Nick ( @WGTA_Nick )\u00a0\u00a0 \n I can see the Arsenal attackers return big points hauls against Leeds this weekend.  Jesus  may well be the one who repeats his heroics from Gameweek 2 and be the top-scoring player this week.\u00a0 \n See:\u00a0 Your essential FPL tips for Gameweek 11 \n GW11 deadline: 18:30 BST, Fri 14 Oct \n",

But in all three matches he has chosen to revert to a back three during the second half. \n The key difference with that pattern is that the players are pushing higher up to make that shape more of an offensive 3-4-2-1. \n O\u2019Neil\u2019s tactical shift made a huge difference at Forest, where his side came back from 2-0 down to win. \n In that match, it was noticeable how much he encouraged his midfielders and wing-backs to take more risks by making runs into advanced areas. \n The stats below prove that AFC Bournemouth have been bolder in an attacking sense since the change was made. \n BOU touches in opponents' box \n \n \n \n Manager \n Opponent \n Touches \n \n \n \n \n O'Neil \n Nott'm Forest \n 17 \n \n \n O'Neil \n Wolves \n 16 \n \n \n Parker \n Arsenal \n 12 \n \n \n O'Neil \n Newcastle \n 10 \n \n \n \n When Billing converted against Newcastle in their last encounter, five Cherries players were inside the Magpies' penalty box. \n O\u2019Neil has reduced caution and given his players the confidence to try and get at their opponents. \n They may have had the fewest shots in the division, but AFC Bournemouth are a fit, hard-working side who have outrun each of their seven opponents. \n That said, O\u2019Neil\u2019s arrival has still sparked a significant upturn in the distance covered by the players per 90 minutes. \n BOU distance covered (km) 22/23 \n \n \n \n Manager \n Opp. \n Km \n Manager \n Opp. \n Km \n \n \n \n \n Parker \n AVL \n 109.2 \n O'Neil \n WOL \n 115.4 \n \n \n Parker \n MCI \n 102.7 \n O'Neil \n NFO \n 110.1 \n \n \n Parker \n ARS \n 109.7 \n O'Neil \n NEW \n 110.0 \n \n \n Parker \n LIV \n 107.9 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Following their  9-0 defeat at Liverpool , AFC Bournemouth players ran an extra 7.5km in their next match at home to Wolves, totalling 115.4km. \n That was O\u2019Neil\u2019s first match and the team have followed that up by recording their second and third-highest numbers for distance covered in the next two outings. \n They are posing an increased goal threat because of additional forward runners, and in defence that collective endeavour has given them a more compact defensive shape. \n O\u2019Neil\u2019s efforts so far have been very impressive. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Chelsea set to benefit from Potter's flexible changes Part 3:\u00a0 How Ten Hag's short-term planning has revived Man Utd Part 4:  Bowen and Antonio can provide missing spark for West Ham Part 5:  Gundogan and Eriksen battle key to derby success Part 6:  Xhaka relishing more freedom at Arsenal \n",

        "text": "\n We take a look at the key lessons from the midweek UEFA Champions League matches, ahead of the weekend's Premier League fixtures. \n Rare disappointment \n It has not been a great couple of weeks for Premier League teams in Europe's leading club competition. \n Tottenham Hotspur  and  Chelsea  both suffered 1-0 away defeats at AC Milan and Borussia Dortmund respectively, before  Liverpool  conceded a 2-0 lead to be crushed 5-2 by defending champions Real Madrid and  Manchester City  were held 1-1 against RB Leipzig. \n For the first time in nine years, and for only the second time since the round of 16 was introduced into the UEFA Champions League, all four English sides failed to win their first-leg encounters. \n On that occasion, only two Premier League sides progressed into the quarters. With English clubs making up six of the last 10 finalists, a lot of work needs to be done to continue to have such representation in Istanbul on 10 June. \n Liverpool\u2019s defensive frailties exposed\u00a0 \n The Premier League club with the most to do are Liverpool. \n Jurgen Klopp 's team showed at Anfield the defensive frailties that have often been exposed in the league this season. \n \"OK, the second goal, we cannot defend better because it is a slapstick [moment],\" Klopp said of the Alisson error that led to it. \n The manner of the other four goals conceded to Real were far more alarming, though, and something that their next opponents,  Crystal Palace , could look to replicate this Saturday. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Liverpool's 28 conceded goals this season, the fourth-best record in the top eight, is two more than they did for the whole of 2021/22.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n CRY \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 0 \n \n LIV \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n As Adrian Clarke points out, Palace are likely to adopt a similar approach to Real did at Anfield with a low defensive block, looking to exploit Liverpool on the counter. \n See:  Firmino gives right balance to Liverpool's attack \n Patrick Vieira 's men are going to be fresher than Klopp's, so it might represent a great chance for Palace to get a first win of the year. \n Hope for the Reds? \n That said, there were some attacking moments from Liverpool that could provide hope for their fans.\u00a0They scored twice for a third consecutive match, with key players  Darwin Nunez  and  Mohamed Salah  combining well again. \n Nunez has goals in back-to-back matches and his confidence is rising, while Salah has either scored or assisted for three matches in a row in all competitions. With  Roberto Firmino  also providing a threat from the bench against Real, Klopp's issues up front appear to be receding. \n Now, just that defence and midfield enforcement to sort. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for Man City \n For the second successive match, City were held to a 1-1 draw after dominating the first half. \n That said, Leipzig did bring more of a threat in the second half than  Nottingham Forest  on Saturday. Their equaliser was not their first shot on target, as was the case with Forest. \n Pep Guardiola  was not too displeased in public and he decided not to use his bench, even if his team had only three shots on target and struggled for chance creation in the absence of the ill  Kevin De Bruyne . \n \"We don't have the team to compete with them in the transitions,\"  Guardiola said . \"They are better than us, they are faster and quicker. \n \"In these situations, German teams are better than us. We had to have a lot of control. \n \n \n \n \n \n BOU \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 4 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n \"We had four games in 10 days, we come here, and then the day after tomorrow we fly to Bournemouth.\" \n At  AFC Bournemouth , they are unlikely to encounter an opponent as fast as Leipzig but one who will set up similar to how Forest did. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n The Cherries will have been buoyed by Forest's display as they seek their first point against Man City. \n After some wayward finishing on Saturday,  Erling Haaland  had a quiet match in Leipzig. His first touch in the opposing penalty area came in the 68th minute. \n At one point towards the end of the match, the Norwegian cut a frustrated figure, flinging his arms up in frustration as his run ignored by a team-mate. \n Haaland, who has one goal in his past four Premier League matches, did not score in  City's 4-0 win in the reverse fixture  and was subbed off in the 74th minute. \n",

\u00a0 \n The manner of Manchester City\u2019s  2-1 defeat to neighbours Man Utd  highlighted concerns at both ends of the pitch for  Pep Guardiola \u2019s side.\u00a0 \n Jack Grealish \u2019s goal was  Man City \u2019s only shot on target, while  Erling Haaland  has now failed to score in three consecutive appearances in all competitions for the first time since joining the club last summer.\u00a0 \n There are also issues in defence, with two goals having been conceded in each of their last two matches in all competitions.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 2 \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n John Stones  missed both of those contests due to injury, so Guardiola will be desperate for the centre-back to be available again for Thursday\u2019s home meeting with Spurs.\u00a0 \n Man Utd exploited the City defence on the counter-attack, and that is something  Antonio Conte  will hope to replicate, just as his side did in last season\u2019s  3-2 win at the Etihad Stadium .\u00a0 \n Isak can make the difference\u00a0 \u00a0 \n Heading towards a third successive goalless draw, the returning  Aleksander Isak  provided the inspiration  Newcastle United  needed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \n The Sweden international, making his first Premier League appearance since September, combined with  Callum Wilson  to break  Fulham \u2019s resistance. \u00a0 \n It was the first time the pair have been on the pitch at the same time in the league, and it could be a partnership that helps the Magpies improve in attack \u2013 their total of 33 goals has been bettered by five other teams.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \n Newcastle did ride their luck on their way to a league-high 11 th  clean sheet, with  Aleksandar Mitrovic \u2019s penalty ruled out after he  accidentally hit the ball twice. \u00a0 \n Despite  Sean Longstaff  ably deputising for the injured  Bruno Guimaraes  in the second half,  Eddie Howe  will know he needs the Brazilian star fit for his side to maintain their top-four push. \u00a0 \n Seagulls adding goals under De Zerbi \u00a0 \n Brighton & Hove Albion \u2019s stunning  3-0 victory over Liverpool  helped the Seagulls leapfrog their opponents up to seventh and was the perfect example of how they have evolved under head coach  Roberto De Zerbi . \u00a0 \n Since the Italian was appointed as  Graham Potter \u2019s successor, only Arsenal and Newcastle, with 25 goals,\u00a0 have \u00a0found the back of the net more often than Brighton (24). \u00a0 \n \n \n The best seat in the house! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83c\udf7f \n\u2014 Brighton & Hove Albion (@OfficialBHAFC)  January 16, 2023 \n \n Potter\u2019s Brighton won many plaudits for the way they played out from the back and were able to move the ball through the thirds, but the finishing touch often eluded his side. \u00a0 \n But in handing starting roles to  Kaoru Mitoma  and more recently youngster  Evan Ferguson , along with pushing  Solly March  further forward, De Zerbi looks to have resolved those issues. \u00a0 \n Could European qualification be on the cards for Brighton? \u00a0 \n Ward-Prowse revels in advanced role \u00a0 \n In what was a crucial match at the bottom of the table,  James Ward-Prowse  provided two defining moments in the  2-1 victory at Everton  that moved  Southampton  to  within a  point of safety and earned manager  Nathan Jones  a first Premier League win. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n SOU \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 1 \n \n AVL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Often used in a more deep-lying midfield role this season, Ward-Prowse was pushed forward into a No 10 role at Goodison Park. \u00a0 \n The Southampton captain\u2019s anticipation and quick feet to produce the equaliser against  Everton  highlighted the quality he can deliver in the final third if he is used in a more advanced position. \u00a0 \n On the back of three consecutive victories in all competitions, Saints will hope to extend their unbeaten run at home to  Aston Villa  on Saturday, with Ward-Prowse and Jones showing signs they can lead Southampton to safety. \u00a0 \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout\u2019s  panel of experts  discuss their chip strategies for the reduced Gameweek 8 round of fixtures in  Fantasy Premier League . \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n For a lot of FPL managers it will be possible to get close to a full team out this Gameweek, and therefore it will be OK to play through without a chip. However, now could be a good time to Wildcard if you want to make changes to your team. \n There are big fixture swings for teams such as  Arsenal . By Wildcarding now, managers could target those with the best long-term fixtures, as well as picking some differentials for GW8. It also allows managers to use the money from Blank Gameweek 8 players such as  Trent Alexander-Arnold  (\u00a37.5m) and  Mohamed Salah  (\u00a312.9m) rather than just benching them. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n It's a good time to Wildcard and I've activated mine this week. A shift away from  Salah , a change of goalkeeper and a switch of formation with three in-form strikers up top are all on the agenda.\u00a0 \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n The Free Hit chip will likely be useful later in the season when we have Blank Gameweeks due to cup fixtures. It's a great time to use the Wildcard now. You can leave players like  Wilfried Zaha  (\u00a37.2m) and  James Maddison  (\u00a37.9m) on your bench for later and still put out a great XI. \n Ben Crabtree ( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n If you can get 10 players with a four-point hit, there's no need to use a chip. I'd be OK with just nine players if you have the main options covered, such as the Arsenal attack and  Newcastle United  defence. If you're happy with your squad, but lacking players this week, Free-Hitting looks fine as Blank Gameweeks are the best use for this. If you are unhappy with the current team and lacking players, I'd Wildcard, knowing we have unlimited free transfers in Gameweek 16. \n Paul Gee ( @FPLPaulGee ) \n This is a team-dependent decision, but if you can't field a full XI with a four-point hit, I would Wildcard. The fixtures swings of Newcastle,  Fulham  and  West Ham United  might make it work out. That Liverpool have a Blank Gameweek and then go on a tough run might make the switch from Salah on a Wildcard a bit easier. \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n Now is a great time to Wildcard. Drop underperforming assets from Liverpool as their fixtures turn and bring in players with favourable fixtures. If you've already used the Wildcard, take points hits to improve your long-term squad this week and save the Free Hit for later in the season.\u00a0 \n Pras ( @Pras_fpl ) \n If you have six or seven missing players this weekend, a chip must be deployed. If you have both the Wildcard and Free Hit available, the former may be better due to the tough fixture runs of Arsenal and  Brighton & Hove Albion . Offloading their players on a Wildcard may not be a bad thing. It makes sense to use the Wildcard over the Free Hit since we have to use one before Gameweek 16 anyway. \n The Free Hit chip may be needed later down the line when either the Gameweek 7 matches are rescheduled, or during the FA Cup quarter-finals Blank Gameweek. If you can put out a strong team this week (even with a -4) without using a chip, there is merit in saving the Wildcard chip for the international break or Gameweeks 12 or 13. \n Jamie Pigott\u00a0 ( @Futbolislifefpl ) \n Gameweeks 8, 9, 12 appear the best strategic times to Wildcard, based on fixtures. \u00a0Wildcard decisions are always team-dependent but if you have three or four blanks and are struggling to get to XI without more than a -4, Wildcarding is perfectly fine. I wouldn't play a Free Hit, save for Double Gameweeks later in the season where there is more upside. \n Sonaldo ( @FPL_Sonaldo ) \n I believe the Free Hit chip will become extremely useful later in the season. Usually a Free Hit would work best in a Blank Gameweek. If you can\u2019t get to 10 starters without hits this week, playing the Wildcard makes sense. With just nine Gameweeks until the FIFA World Cup, it\u2019s just about the right amount of time to maximise the Wildcard. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Gameweek 8: What FPL managers need to know Part 2:  How to approach reduced Gameweek 8 Part 3:\u00a0 GW8 Ones to watch: Mitrovic to continue goal run Part 4:  GW8 Differentials: Isak has schedule to thrive Part 5:  FPL expert: Who to put in your Free Hit team Part 7:\u00a0 GW8 Captains: De Bruyne and Kane can rival Haaland Part 8:  Scout Selection: Best FPL team for Gameweek 8 \n GW8 deadline: 18:30 BST Friday 16 Sept \n",

an identical return to his experience across his first four matches at  Crystal Palace . \n Allardyce's first four matches in charge \n \n \n \n Club \n Season \n W \n D \n L \n Pts \n \n \n \n \n Crystal Palace \n 2016/17 \n 0 \n 1 \n 3 \n 1 \n \n \n Everton \n 2017/18 \n 3 \n 1 \n 0 \n 10 \n \n \n West Brom \n 2020/21 \n 0 \n 1 \n 3 \n 1 \n \n \n \n Allardyce inherits a Leeds side who have leaked 23 goals in their last seven matches. \n For this reason, you can expect him to focus his attention on improving team shape and defensive organisation. \n He is not set on one specific formation, but it is unusual for an Allardyce side to line up without a lone striker. \n Out of possession his sides tend to drop into a 4-5-1, but on the ball he likes to deploy two wingers in support of the main centre-forward. \n Allardyce's favoured formations \n \n \n \n Palace \n Everton \n West Brom \n \n \n \n \n 4-2-3-1 \n 57% \n 4-2-3-1 \n 50% \n 4-1-4-1 \n 40% \n \n \n 4-1-4-1 \n 14% \n 4-3-3 \n 25% \n 4-4-1-1 \n 36% \n \n \n \n Both  Jesse Marsch  and  Javier Gracia  preferred a 4-2-3-1, so we may see a continuation of that shape. \n Leeds have earned only five clean sheets from 34 matches. \n In open play they have given up too many quality opportunities to their opponents. \n Their Expected Goals Against (xGA) from open play is a division-high 44.1, and this is reflected in the 52 goals they have conceded this way, the most of any Premier League side. \n Clean-sheet mentality \n Allardyce has always tried to build a clean-sheet mentality within his squad. \n Over the course of his career he has earned shutouts in 27.7 per cent of his matches. \n If that level had been replicated across this season by Leeds, they would have amassed between nine and 10 clean sheets. \n This could have made a tremendous difference to their league position. \n Allardyce teams' defensive records \n \n \n \n Club \n P \n Goals conceded/match \n Clean sheet % \n \n \n \n \n Bolton \n 226 \n 1.3 \n 27.4% \n \n \n West Ham \n 114 \n 1.3 \n 29.8% \n \n \n Blackburn \n 76 \n 1.4 \n 32.9% \n \n \n Sunderland \n 30 \n 1.5 \n 23.3% \n \n \n West Brom \n 25 \n 2.0 \n 16.0% \n \n \n Everton \n 24 \n 1.3 \n 33.3% \n \n \n Newcastle \n 21 \n 1.6 \n 14.3% \n \n \n Crystal Palace \n 21 \n 1.5 \n 28.6% \n \n \n Total \n 537 \n 1.4 \n 27.7% \n \n \n \n Leeds have tried to play through the lines for the majority of 2022/23. \n On average just 12 per cent of their passes have been classified as long, but this figure is likely to jump across the remaining matches. \n Allardyce's teams go from back to front quickly, often taking the aerial route, so we could see a noticeable shift at Man City on Saturday. \n In at least three of their four remaining fixtures - with the possible exception of their match at West Ham - we are also likely to see Leeds have far less possession than their season average of 48 per cent. \n Allardyce teams' possession/long passes\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Club \n Possession \n % long passes \n \n \n \n \n Bolton \n N/A \n N/A \n \n \n West Ham \n 43.6% \n 18.5% \n \n \n Blackburn \n 44.1% \n 20.9% \n \n \n Sunderland \n 39.9% \n 21.0% \n \n \n West Brom \n 34.8% \n 21.7% \n \n \n Everton \n 44.2% \n 19.3% \n \n \n Newcastle \n 50.3% \n 18.9% \n \n \n Crystal Palace \n 41.7% \n 21.5% \n \n \n \n There is a strong possibility Allardyce will instruct his players to drop into a compact shape with 10 or 11 men behind the ball, before launching fast and direct counter-attacks. \n Without leaving a high defensive line, he will also want to crowd space in midfield by working in packs to press the man on the ball. \n This was his tactical approach in a  5-2 win  by his West Brom side at  Chelsea  in April 2021. \n In a 5-4-1 that day they showed resilience, before efficiently picking off  Thomas Tuchel \u2019s side on the break, with just 34 per cent of possession. \n It will be tough to replicate that formula at the Etihad Stadium this Saturday, but it is a ploy which has worked for Allardyce in the past. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  Isak poses biggest threat to Arsenal's title hopes Part 3:  Key battles of Monday's matches \n",

A terrific counter-press from him and  Kevin De Bruyne  forced a loose pass from  Gabriel  that was intercepted by the Portuguese star. \n From that crucial turnover, Bernardo slipped  Erling Haaland  in behind, before City worked the ball well from right to left, eventually finding an unmarked  Jack Grealish  at the far post. \n Grealish scores City's second goal \n \n \n . @JackGrealish 's passion is everything! \ud83d\ude4c  pic.twitter.com/3kgbAPzetz \n\u2014 Manchester City (@ManCity)  February 16, 2023 \n \n In addition to these personnel changes, Guardiola's change of tack was built around asking his players to press with greater aggression in much more advanced areas. \n This forced key errors from the Gunners, who found themselves stifled and unable to find any flow with their passing. \n Big possession, few chances \n Impressively, Arsenal had 68 per cent of possession in the second half. \n Indeed, across the whole match they restricted Man City to just 36 per cent of the ball,\u00a0the lowest share in a league match in Guardiola's top-flight managerial career. \n Yet  Mikel Arteta 's side had to wait until the 83rd minute for the first of only three second-half shots. \n Before the break, Arsenal moved the ball smoothly through the thirds and created the best chances. \n Largely untroubled by a tame Man City press, the champions were only able to win possession back from inside the Gunners half on seven occasions. \n Pushing his players 10 yards higher up the pitch after the break, Guardiola's side forced a significant amount of turnovers. \n Higher press paid off \n Overall, City won possession on 21 occasions inside Arsenal territory between the 46th-minute and full-time; three times as often as they had during a passive opening period. \n Their third goal also stemmed from a regain inside Arsenal's half of the field. \n Leandro Trossard  was surrounded by three light blue shirts and relinquished possession under duress. \n From that transition, De Bruyne and Haaland stayed between defenders brilliantly to seal the win. \n \n \n . @ErlingHaaland 's 32nd goal of the season! \ud83d\udd25  pic.twitter.com/6IUnUSBYm9 \n\u2014 Manchester City (@ManCity)  February 16, 2023 \n \n Going longer \n In recent weeks Arsenal's defenders have experienced one or two problems dealing with long aerial passes. \n In a bid to test their resolve once more, Guardiola was happy to encourage his players to follow suit. \n Over the course of the match, 17.6 per cent of City's passes were classified as long. \n Putting that into context, only 8.4 per cent and 5.4 per cent of their distribution fell into that category during their last two matches against  Aston Villa  and  Tottenham Hotspur . \n During the second half that figure leapt to an incredible 22 per cent, the highest proportion \u00a0 of long passes they have made in a half of Premier League football under Guardiola. \n Man City's passing stats compared \n \n \n \n Opp \n Date \n Passes \n Long passes \n % Long \n Half \n \n \n \n \n ARS \n 15/02/2023 \n 127 \n 28 \n 22% \n 2nd \n \n \n CRY \n 19/11/2016 \n 193 \n 36 \n 18.7% \n 2nd \n \n \n EVE \n 06/02/2019 \n 219 \n 37 \n 16.9% \n 2nd \n \n \n CRY \n 19/11/2016 \n 254 \n 42 \n 16.5% \n 1st \n \n \n TOT \n 14/04/2018 \n 252 \n 40 \n 15.9% \n 2nd \n \n \n \n Goalkeeper  Ederson  found Haaland with five passes, more than anybody else at Emirates Stadium. \n De Bruyne's opening goal stemmed from one of the goalkeeper's lengthy clearances aimed towards Haaland. \n William Saliba  initially failed to clear and under pressure,  Takehiro Tomiyasu 's back pass was intercepted by De Bruyne, who curled home with aplomb. \n \n \n KDB's opener! \u26a1  pic.twitter.com/Z3jiSf82No \n\u2014 Manchester City (@ManCity)  February 16, 2023 \n \n Asking questions and picking up second balls from individual errors, Man City's direct style of play was problematic for Arsenal. \n Arsenal will rue their preventable defensive mistakes and missed chances in the first half. \n Inside both boxes Man City were the better side, finding a way to win with a clever second-half tactical shift. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Haaland equals club record as City go top of the table Part 3:  Guardiola: Arsenal are still top of the league Part 4:  What's next in the title race after Man City beat Arsenal? \n",

        "text": "\n Following a thrilling weekend delivering drama from top to bottom in the Premier League, Alex Keble looks at the key talking points and tactical lessons. \n Arsenal\u2019s drop-off highlights lack of squad depth \n A third consecutive draw, this time courtesy of a disastrous first 15 minutes against rock-bottom  Southampton , has expanded  Arsenal \u2019s mini-wobble into a run that threatens to envelope half of the 2022/23 season. \n \n \n \n \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n 3 - 3 \n \n SOU \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Zooming out,  Mikel Arteta \u2019s side have won seven of their last 13 matches and collected only 25 points. This is a points-per-match record of 1.92 that would provide 73 over a whole season. \n In other words, since the halfway point of the season, Arsenal have regressed to their 2021/22 form. \n This is not just about bad luck or wasteful moments, either. \n Arsenal have continued to score at about the same rate: 2.46 goals per match, compared with 2.36 across their first 19. But the underlying numbers show a drop-off in their defending: \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n First 19 matches \n Last 13 matches \n \n \n \n \n Goals conceded (per 90) \n 14 (0.78) \n 17 (1.31) \n \n \n Clean sheets \n 9 \n 3 \n \n \n xG against (per 90) \n 16.83 (0.94) \n 16.83 (1.30) \n \n \n Shots on target (per 90) \n 8.7 (3.0) \n 9.3 (3.9) \n \n \n \n The simplest explanation is that Arsenal are worse without  William Saliba  in the side, although this is as much to do with his on-the-ball work as his traditional defending. \n Rob Holding \u2019s pass accuracy of 85.5 per cent is notably lower than Saliba\u2019s 91.0 per cent. Holding attempts more than twice as many long passes - 11.7 per match, compared with Saliba\u2019s 5.4, reflecting the Frenchman\u2019s superior composure and line-breaking qualities. \n This has made Arsenal less able to control matches, calmly evade the opposition press, or keep teams penned in for long periods, hence their deterioration over the last three fixtures, in particular. \n It might even explain why  Aaron Ramsdale  avoided the simple passing option out to Holding in the opening minute, instead of seeking to break the lines himself, which led to the opener. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Aaron Ramsdale ignored passing to Holding (just out of shot) along the yellow path, instead trying to pass to Zinchenko (red path) and was intercepted for the opener\n             \n \n Arsenal\u2019s loss of fluency and measured possession without Saliba forms part of a wider trend that highlights their lack of squad depth. \n Arteta\u2019s side are yet to drop a single Premier League point this season with his preferred 11 and have come unstuck many times when just one component part is removed. \n They were more disjointed, and vulnerable to being caught in the transition, when,  a)  Albert Sambi Lokonga  held the base of midfield in a  3-1 defeat to Manchester United  in September;  b)  Oleksandr Zinchenko  was absent in the  1-1 draw with Southampton  in October and the  2-2 draw with West Ham United  in April;  c) the more static  Eddie Nketiah  replaced  Gabriel Jesus  in February's  1-0 defeat to Everton  and  1-1 draw with Brentford . \n With reports suggesting Saliba may not play again before the end of the season, Arsenal must find a way to adapt, starting with  Wednesday\u2019s trip to Manchester City , which now looks like a must-win match. \n Spurs\u2019 chaotic defence a nadir \n A clumsy season is bending towards catastrophe for  Tottenham Hotspur , who now have their third head coach in the space of a month after sacking  Cristian Stellini  on Monday and putting  Ryan Mason  in charge. \n See:\u00a0 Stellini leaves Spurs as Mason takes charge again \n You could argue whether blame for Sunday's capitulation at  Newcastle United \u00a0ultimately lies with the succession of poor decisions \u2013 from transfers to managerial appointments \u2013 that have led to this point. \n \n \n \n \n \n NEW \n \n \n \n \n 6 - 1 \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n The decision to promote Antonio Conte\u2019s assistant Stellini and keep a tactical model that was faltering looks flawed and has now been abandoned. \n Stellini's attempt at a completely new strategy at St James' Park also did not work. \n Not since January 2022, or 50 Premier League matches ago, had Spurs lined up with a back four \u2013 and it showed. \n The players seemed unsure of how to play in the 4-2-3-1 formation. Worse still, they had apparently been instructed to deploy a high defensive line but without the requisite pressing. \n You cannot have one without the other, or else the opposition have the time and space to clip passes over the top of the defensive line, as Newcastle did for the second and fourth goals. \n However, just as important was the disorganisation where a zigzag defensive line formed helplessly as the home side poured forward. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Joe Willock picks out Alexander Isak for Newcastle's fourth goal\n             \n \n Stellini's decision to use  Ivan Perisic  and  Pedro Porro  as full-backs in a back four, despite both being natural wingers who were converted into wing-backs, was a mistake. \n It\u2019s no wonder they struggled to track Newcastle runners or cover the gaps across the back four. It looked a formation and strategy that was alien to most of the squad. \n Spurs have now conceded nine goals in their last two matches, hardly an ideal way to enter a week in which they  face Manchester United , buoyed by their progression to the FA Cup final, and  Liverpool , who have scored nine in their last two matches. \n As he reflects on his departure, Stellini may well feel he was stuck between a rock and a hard place: fans wanted an end to the conservative football, but his first attempt to move towards a more attacking set-up was a disaster. \n Liverpool set-piece precision shows they remain invaluable \n In the modern pursuit of tactical perfection in open play, as the concepts of pressing traps, transitions and half-spaces become common parlance, sometimes the traditional routes to goal can be overlooked by analysts. \n \n \n \n \n \n LIV \n \n \n \n \n 3 - 2 \n \n NFO \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n All managers recognise the simple value of a good set-piece, but it says a lot about our perceptions of the great tacticians that someone like  Jurgen Klopp \u00a0is very rarely praised for consistently coaching attacking set-pieces so well. \n Over the past five seasons, Liverpool have been right up there with the division\u2019s best. \n Liverpool set-piece goals by season \n \n \n \n Season \n Set-piece goals (excl penalties) \n Rank \n \n \n \n \n 2022/23 \n 14 \n 1st= \n \n \n 2021/22 \n 19 \n 2nd \n \n \n 2020/21 \n 12 \n 5th \n \n \n 2019/20 \n 17 \n 1st= \n \n \n 2018/19 \n 20 \n 1st \n \n \n \n Diogo Jota  scored two from such situations in the 3-2 victory over  Nottingham Forest  and  Liverpool  as a team, scored all three of their goals from set-pieces. \n After the match, Jota revealed they had been focusing on this area in particular. \n \u201cIt\u2019s always hard when you need to attack a low block with a lot of defenders and a lot of people around,\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew that set-pieces could be a real advantage for us today.\u201d \n Liverpool\u2019s quality during the Klopp era has frequently forced worried opponents to sit deep and Forest\u2019s low block at Anfield was an extreme example. \n Steve Cooper \u2019s side held just 20 per cent and Liverpool\u2019s 80 per cent was their highest in a Premier League match this season. \n When there are that many players crowding the area, it is inevitably difficult to create chances in open play, while the likelihood of fouls and corner concessions increases. That\u2019s why Liverpool work so hard on the uglier, and less tactical, side of the game. \n It certainly wasn\u2019t the prettiest win, but at this stage of the season that hardly matters. \n Liverpool have now won consecutive Premier League matches and, having only claimed three wins in a row once before this season, must finally put a sequence together if they are to qualify for the UEFA Europa League. \n But they\u2019ll need a different method to beat  West Ham  on Wednesday. The Hammers have conceded only three goals from set-pieces, the fewest in the Premier League. \n Everton sink but Calvert-Lewin offers hope \n Everton  dropped back into the bottom three this weekend with a 0-0 draw against  Crystal Palace  that extended their winless run to five, yet  Sean Dyche  has every right to feel optimistic about his team\u2019s chances across the final six matches. \n \n \n \n \n \n CRY \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 0 \n \n EVE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n For starters, Everton kept their first away clean sheet since October and against a Palace side who had scored nine goals in their last three. \n It was deserved, too, with Everton\u2019s 0.5 xGA (Expected Goals Against) their joint-lowest in a match this season and lowest away from Goodison Park. \n With the defensive side improving, Everton fans will hope the return of  Dominic Calvert-Lewin  inspires the full implementation of Dyche-ball. \n Calvert-Lewin won six aerial duels, his joint-most this season, while Everton won a season-record 35 aerial duels thanks in part to their increased long-ball game: they attempted 83 in total, their second most in a Dyche-led Everton match this campaign. \n It almost led to a winner. \n Everton\u2019s best chance came from a long  Jordan Pickford  clearance and  Alex Iwobi  winning the second ball after Calvert-Lewin\u2019s aerial challenge. Iwobi slipped a pass back to Calvert-Lewin, who fired just wide. Had it gone in, it would have been the archetypal Dyche winner and an archetypal Dyche 1-0 win. \n Buendia finally thriving \n Aston Villa  rode their luck in the 1-1 draw at  Brentford , where the hosts could easily have put the match to bed before a late equaliser from  Douglas Luiz . \n \n \n \n \n \n BRE \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 1 \n \n AVL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Nevertheless,  Unai Emery \u2019s triple substitution in the 67th minute completely changed the rhythm of the match. Villa, now with  John McGinn  controlling central midfield, held 70 per cent possession, outshooting Brentford 8-2 from that point on. \n Villa\u2019s best player, and not for the first time in recent weeks, was  Emiliano Buendia , who after a slow start to his Villa career has found his feet under the tutelage of Emery. \n On Saturday, he hit a season high for shot-creating actions (eight), progressive carries (four), and take-ons (four), as well as providing the assist for Douglas Luiz. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Emiliano Buendia's touches v Brentford\n             \n \n Over the last two years, Buendia, has often looked a little too lightweight to cope with opposition pressure when receiving the ball between the lines as a No 10, but that has changed thanks to the detail of Emery\u2019s coaching. \n Buendia tends to take possession in larger areas of space these days, giving him an extra second to find the composure \u2013 and strength \u2013 to shield the ball and thread a pass. \n All of a sudden, he is fulfilling the promise he showed in the Championship season that preceded his transfer to Villa, when Buendia amassed 15 goals and 15 assists for Norwich City. \n Even when Villa don\u2019t win, there is something fresh to say about the Emery revolution. European football back at Villa Park looks increasingly likely. \n",

        "text": "\n This is not the first time that  Jurgen Klopp  has turned to an acquaintance from the city of Dusseldorf at a difficult time.\u00a0 \n After  Liverpool \u2019s UEFA Champions League final defeat to Real Madrid in Kyiv in 2018, the Reds\u2019 boss spent the night commiserating with friends including Andreas \"Campino\" Frege, the lead singer of popular Dusseldorf rock band  Die Toten Hosen  \u2013 and a big Liverpool fan.\u00a0 \n And now, after a tough season, it appears Klopp suggested that Jorg Schmadtke, another son of the western German city, and indeed a fellow friend of Campino, fill the vacant sporting director role at the club. \n Introducing Jorg Schmadtke \n While largely unknown in England, Schmadtke is a well established name in German football after successful spells as sporting director at Alemannia Aachen, Hannover 96, FC Cologne and VfL Wolfsburg, all of whom he has helped steer into European competition in the last 20 years.\u00a0 \n Klopp will have been aware of Schmadtke\u2019s work at Hannover in particular. He experienced it up close during his time at Borussia Dortmund. It took the young Dortmund coach four attempts to register a win against Germany\u2019s \u201cReds\u201d, who qualified for the UEFA Europa League in 2011 and 2012 but have since become part of the furniture in Bundesliga 2, Germany's second tier.\u00a0 \n In September 2011, champions Dortmund even lost at home to a Hannover side featuring typically clever Schmadtke signings such as midfielder Lars Stindl, who would go on to captain Borussia Monchengladbach in the UEFA Champions League and star for Germany at the 2017 Confederations Cup in Russia.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Jurgen Klopp, then head coach of Dortmund, greets Jorg Schmadtke of Hannover prior to a 2012 Bundesliga match\n             \n \n It was also at Hannover that Schmadtke took his first dip into the English transfer market, picking up  Mame Biram Diouf  from  Manchester United . The Senegal striker did not make the grade at Old Trafford, but scored 35 goals in 71 appearances for Hannover, including in the Europa League.\u00a0 \n After Hannover, Schmadtke oversaw a similarly successful era at Cologne, pulling the strings as the notoriously unpredictable side won promotion to the Bundesliga and then qualified for Europe for the first time in 25 years.\u00a0 \n He hired future Dortmund head coach Peter Stoger and established a team around players such as Germany left-back Jonas Hector and French striker  Anthony Modeste , once of Blackburn Rovers and now at Dortmund. \n In recognition of his work on the banks of the Rhine, Schmadtke was named Sporting Director of the Year in 2017 by German football magazine  11Freunde .\u00a0 \n Surprising move to Anfield \n Nonetheless, Liverpool\u2019s interest in Schmadtke\u2019s services have still taken many by surprise in his homeland, not least because the 59-year-old had recently announced that his role as Wolfsburg's sporting director would be his last before retiring from professional football.\u00a0 \n Among the players Schmadtke enticed to Wolfsburg were Dutch striker  Wout Weghorst , now at Man Utd,  Lukas\u202fNmecha , originally on loan from  Manchester City , and Austrian midfielder Xaver Schlager, now of RB Leipzig.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Wout Weghorst, now at Man Utd, was one of the players Schmadtke brought to Wolfsburg\n             \n \n In his time at Wolfsburg, Schmadtke oversaw the qualification for the Europa League in 2018 under head coach Bruno Labbadia, before they reached the Champions League with Oliver Glasner at the helm a year later.\u00a0 \n But neither coach remained in Wolfsburg, citing difficulties working with Schmadtke. Glasner even gave up the chance of coaching in the Champions League to take charge of Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League, which he won.\u00a0 \n Labbadia and Glasner weren\u2019t the first to fall out with Schmadtke. His successes at his various clubs have always been tempered by disagreements with head coaches and other club employees.\u00a0 \n Under his management, Bundesliga 2 club Aachen reached the German Cup final, qualified for the UEFA Cup and won promotion to the Bundesliga, clearing the club\u2019s debts in the process. But his time there ended in an acrimonious TV interview.\u00a0 \n \u201cSchmadtke works best when you follow his rules,\u201d wrote the local  Aachener Zeitung  newspaper at the time, before further differences of opinion followed with Mirko Slomka in Hannover and Stoger in Cologne.\u00a0 \n Indeed, the German adjective that appears most in connection with Schmadtke is  kauzig  \u2013 a bit edgy, a bit stubborn or, perhaps colloquially in the north west of England, a bit \u201crum\u201d.\u00a0 \n 'A great personality' \n Since the news broke,  Spiegel  magazine has referred to Schmadtke as \"Klopp\u2019s grumpy one\", but the Liverpool manager will know him better and described Schmadtke as \u201ca great personality\u201d back in January.\u00a0 \n His character will now be tested. At Anfield, Schmadtke will encounter a club on a different scale to those he\u2019s worked with before, in a country where the role of sporting director is less powerful than in Germany.\u00a0 \n Following in the footsteps of departed Liverpool sporting directors Michael Edwards and Julian Ward, Schmadtke will be expected to adapt and work closely not only with Klopp but also with long-term scouts Dave Fallows and Barry Hunter.\u00a0 \n Can he make the step up and prove the doubters in Germany wrong? \n Matt Ford ( @matt_4d ) is a freelance journalist specialising in German football, fan culture and sports politics \n",

Some will be back with their reputations enhanced after starring on the global stage. Others have suffered heartbreak with their nations. \n Who will immediately hit top form after a short time back with their team-mates and who will need a little more time? How will managers handle their squads?

He could also surpass  Alan Shearer \u2019s leading total of 23 for the most goals over the whole festive period. Kane is just four goals away.\u00a0 \n On top of that, the Spurs striker is just five shy of his 200th Premier League goal. And with his team-mate  Son Heung-min  needing four more to reach 100, there could be milestones to celebrate in north London over the turn of the year. \n See: \u00a0 Kane targets festive goal records \n Can Haaland pick up where he left off? \n Erling Haaland  is well on course to win the  Castrol Golden Boot  in his debut Premier League season, returning to action with 18 goals to his name already. \n Worryingly for rival defences, the Norwegian has been resting during the World Cup and scored in his only friendly match during the tournament. Can anyone stop him from rewriting the records books? \n See:  Clinical Haaland has edge over chasing pack \n Can rested Salah find his form? \n Three-time Golden Boot winner  Mohamed Salah  is playing catch-up this season, scoring only six times so far. But, like Haaland, the Egyptian has had the benefit of a rest during the World Cup. \n With fresh legs and a more central role up front in a new  Liverpool  formation, it would be no surprise to see Salah returning to his blistering best and firing sixth-placed Liverpool up the table. \n FPL managers enter Second Chance league \n There is great news for  Fantasy Premier League  managers who missed the start of the 2022/23 season or are disappointed with their world ranking after 16 Gameweeks. \n A new Second Chance league has begun, where everyone starts from zero and scoring begins in Gameweek 17, with special prizes to be won at the season's end. \n Since managers have unlimited transfers until 11:00 GMT on Monday 26 December, there is every incentive for them to refocus and pick the best possible squad. \n See:   More on the Second Chance league \u00a0 \n More rest for players between matches \n The festive fixtures traditionally come thick and fast, but this season special arrangements have been made for players to allow more time between matches played across the three festive rounds. \n The rest period between Matchweeks 18-19 has been increased to ensure no club play within 48 hours of another of their matches. \n New managers aim to make an impact \n There were managerial changes shortly before the World Cup, and the new men in charge will be keen to instil their ideas as the league resumes. \n Julen Lopetegui faces an immediate six-pointer at the bottom of the table, with his  Wolverhampton Wanderers  side visiting 17th-placed  Everton  on Boxing Day. \n Nathan Jones  is set for his second fixture with  Southampton , while  Unai Emery  will look to pick up where he left off with  Aston Villa , having won his last two matches, although he faces Liverpool and Spurs in his next two. \n Gary O'Neil  must also navigate tough festive fixtures after taking permanent charge of  AFC Bournemouth  during the World Cup. The Cherries visit Chelsea on 27 December and  Manchester United  on 3 January. \n",

        "text": "\n The meeting of  Manchester City  and  Arsenal  on Wednesday is the most eagerly awaited match of the season, pitting  Pep Guardiola  up against his former assistant  Mikel Arteta  for the third time so far in 2023. \n \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 1 \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Both managers will need to make do without key defenders for this potentially decisive encounter, so Adrian Clarke takes a closer look at how the two Spaniards may look to exploit any possible weaknesses. \n Will City take direct route against Holding? \n Guardiola altered his side\u2019s usual style of play quite dramatically for both of City\u2019s matches against Arsenal this season. \n Partly in a bid to nullify Arsenal\u2019s much-improved press and in an attempt to test Arteta\u2019s central defenders up against the pace and power of  Erling Haaland , they played a far higher frequency of longer passes. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n In only one other Premier League match this season,  Brighton & Hove Albion  at home, have more than 10 per cent of City\u2019s passes been classified as long and it was 10.1 per cent. \n But in their  3-1 league win at Emirates Stadium , that ratio was an incredible 17.2 per cent. \n Boasting only 36.5 per cent share of possession, and with an unusually low passing accuracy of only 72.3 per cent, City took on a very different approach. \n Man City's most long passes 22/23 \n \n \n \n Opponent \n Comp \n Long pass % \n \n \n \n \n Arsenal (A) \n PL \n 17.2% \n \n \n Arsenal (H) \n FAC \n 13.2% \n \n \n Bayern (A) \n UCL \n 11.7% \n \n \n Season average \n 7.4% \n \n \n \n City\u2019s direct style of play towards Haaland was problematic for Arsenal in both matches as they asked questions and picked up second balls from individual errors. \n Haaland unsettled  Rob Holding  on several occasions in the 1-0 FA Cup win, and in the league encounter his height and running power certainly caught the eye. \n The Norwegian almost won a penalty when running in behind  Gabriel , and he also played a key role in  Kevin De Bruyne \u2019s opener. \n His aerial threat from  Ederson \u2019s goal-kick forced an error from  William Saliba , and from his backheader  Takehiro Tomiyasu \u2019s poor backpass was intercepted by De Bruyne. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                In the reverse fixture, Ederson's long ball into space for Haaland forced an error from William Saliba\n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Tomiyasu\u2019s poor backpass was intercepted by De Bruyne to score the opener\n             \n \n Does Stones role change things? \n Since those meetings Guardiola has begun to use  John Stones  in central midfield in a bid to help his side play out from the back with increased assurance. \n If he adopts such a 3-4-3 with a box-shaped midfield against Arsenal on Wednesday evening it could indicate that City will play fewer long passes this time. \n Even so, Arsenal and stand-in central defender Holding would be advised to ready themselves for more a direct tactical approach from the hosts. \n To combat this threat they must be resilient, and leave as little space in behind as possible. \n Saka to make most of Ake absence? \n Nathan Ake  has been City\u2019s best defender this season, so if he misses out through injury, it could be good news for Arsenal\u2019s talisman  Bukayo Saka . \n The right-winger has found it difficult to influence matches when up against the assured and athletic Dutchman, who is superb in 1v1 situations. \n It is Saka\u2019s forte of course, and his driving runs down the right will be a concern for Guardiola\u2019s defenders. \n Best ball carriers 22/23 \n \n \n \n Player \n Chance-creating ball carries \n Player \n Goal/assist-ending ball carries \n \n \n \n \n Saka \n 46 \n Saka \n 6 \n \n \n March \n 41 \n Martinelli \n 6 \n \n \n Benrahma \n 40 \n March \n 6 \n \n \n Martinelli \n 39 \n Watkins \n 6 \n \n \n Salah \n 39 \n Kulusevski \n 6 \n \n \n \n The searing pace and directness of Saka and fellow wide forward  Gabriel Martinelli  has potential to cause problems for City\u2019s wide centre-backs in a 3-4-3. \n With the ball at their feet, these two Arsenal youngsters are among the best in the division, creating 85 chances between them from successful ball carries. \n Bayern Munich\u2019s pace in wide areas caused City issues in their recent UEFA Champions League tie, so look out for the Gunners targeting this area. \n Turnovers key for both teams \n City\u2019s second and third goals against Arsenal at Emirates Stadium came from regaining possession inside the Gunners\u2019 half. \n Pressing brilliantly as a team they suffocated Arteta\u2019s players, forcing a series of mistakes during an outstanding second-half display. \n In their draws against  West Ham United  and  Southampton , Arsenal were also fragile against the press, so you can be sure City will harass with aggression. \n Top turnover teams (with rank) \n \n \n \n Total high turnovers (PL rank) \n Shot-ending high turnovers (PL rank) \n Goal-ending high turnovers (PL rank) \n \n \n \n \n Arsenal \n 318 (1st) \n Arsenal \n 52 (1st) \n Man City \n 9 (1st) \n \n \n Man City \n 297 (2nd) \n Man City \n 41 (6th) \n Arsenal \n 7 (3rd) \n \n \n \n But Arsenal will also hunt for turnovers in advanced areas. \n At times during both matches against City they went man-to-man and did their best to force regains inside the opposition half. \n As the stats above highlight, these are the two best pressing sides in the Premier League. \n The team who cope best with their opponents\u2019 press, making the fewest mistakes under duress, is likely to prevail in this high-stakes duel. \n Also in this series \n Man City v Arsenal - Everything you need to know \n",

        "text": "\n In 2020, former Portsmouth winger Courtney Pitt was one of the first intake of six coaches on the Premier League, EFL and PFA Charity's  Professional Player to Coach Scheme \u00a0(PPCS) which aims to increase the number of black, and Asian and mixed heritage players moving into full-time coaching roles.\u00a0 \n Two years later, we caught up with him as he starts his new permanent role as the club's Head of Academy Coaching. \n What does the job entail? \n \"When I started out on my PPCS placement, I was gaining experience in six different departments including Foundation, Youth Development, and the Under-18s in order to get a well-rounded behind-the-scenes view of how the Academy works. I then oversaw the U9s, U11s and continued to move through the age groups to gain further experience. \n \"The club saw my progress and how hard I had worked and this summer I was promoted to my new role as Head of Academy. It was great to know that the club have a sense of trust in me to put me in that position. I now oversee the whole programme so have a say in the Academy structure, oversee coaches, and help with the development of over 100 players from U9s to U16s. \n \"When I joined the PPCS my aim was to get a full-time job somewhere in football and the programme has helped me do that.\" \n How is this different from the previous roles you had at Burton during your placement? \n \"I delegate and oversee the structure of how to do things, to make sure that the Academy is in line with the overall club philosophy and playing philosophy.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Courtney Pitt in action in his debut season for Portsmouth in 2001/02\n             \n \n What are the biggest challenges in your role? \n \"In all honesty everyone seems aligned to help. Whether they become professional footballers or not, one of the key priorities is to ensure players have the necessary life skills that can be transferred so that if they don't make it into our first team, we have given them some skills in life to succeed. \n \"Only a tiny percentage of players get through their Scholarship, Academy and sign as a pro, so the emphasis on developing well-rounded people in the Academy is crucial.\" \n How important has PPCS been in providing the placement within the club, alongside the development provision provided by the League? \n \"The scheme got me a position at a football club, which had been so difficult to do. I was given an opportunity of actually getting in to a club to show what I could do, ride the challenge, learn and develop in myself. The PPCS has been a huge help for me to get a foot in the door and supporting me as I develop. It's great to see new cohorts too, and important that the scheme continues to grow and thrive.\" \n How important is it for a club academy to have more diversity among the coaching staff? \n \"It's so important to have a greater presence of minority groups, especially in leadership roles. You've got to be qualified, got to be the right person, however if you have the same group of people having the same conversations, you are never going to get a different perspective or ideas, it stays the same. \n \"Uncomfortable conversations need to be had sometimes because otherwise things won't change. There's a lot of players from different backgrounds and it's important that you can relate to them, and that they can relate to you.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n What do you think about being one of six PPCS participants who have gone on to attain full-time coaching roles in the professional game? \n \"There's six of us who have participated on the scheme including Jon-Paul Pittman at Forest Green Rovers, Eric Odhiambo at Coventry City and Darren Byfield, who is now involved with the first team at Crawley Town. A lot of us have got full-time roles as we have had the opportunity to prove our worth. We have our own WhatsApp group and encourage each other, set challenges, discuss things. \n \"The encouragement and support we have given each other over the past two years has been amazing. We're like-minded people who want to progress, want to do better and want to help people. I am proud of each and every one of us.\" \n What are your ambitions? \n \"I want to keep learning and improving. This has been a massive promotion for me and is a huge position. My first focus is on this role and hopefully in the next three to five years ideally see loads of Academy players make it through to the first team, or if not there, then in and around the Football League. \n Before it didn't feel like there were many options and certainly not many opportunities, so progress has been made with schemes like PPCS. I hope that if players from minority groups can see me and others making headway, they will see the potential and opportunity to follow if that's what they want to do. \n See:\u00a0 Coach Index to create more diverse coaching workforce \n \"If you can't see minority groups in leadership positions, and not just in football, it's easy to think that it's not attainable. I don't really see myself as a role model but if I can play a small role in helping others feel what I'm doing is attainable, then great. \n \"My priority though, is to help players develop and fulfil their dream of being a professional footballer in the first team. I know how special that is. If they don't make it as a professional, then my aim is to ensure that they are as well-equipped as possible, as a person, to work in a different environment.\" \n",

Nine of their league victories have been by a single goal, perhaps suggesting things were never quite as rosy as they seemed. \n After all, Man Utd\u2019s Expected Goals (xG) differential of +8.2 is below  Liverpool \u2019s (+10.1) and  Brighton & Hove Albion \u2019s (+16.5), and only marginally better than that of  Tottenham Hotspur  (+7.2), who are supposedly having a poor season. \n The return of  Casemiro  looks key for their top-four hopes. Man Utd have lost four of their eight Premier League matches without Casemiro and just three of the 19 in which he has featured. His absence was deeply felt in the defeat at Newcastle. \n It speaks volumes that  Marcel Sabitzer  completed just 28 passes, six fewer than his goalkeeper  David De Gea , and telling that Ten Hag tried an experimental rejig, placing  Scott McTominay  at the tip of midfield in the first half before using  Bruno Fernandes  as a lone No 6 for the final 20 minutes. \n McTominay and  Wout Weghorst , for so long the two most advanced Man Utd players, exchanged passes just three times \u2013 hence why Newcastle outshot the visitors by 22 attempts to eight. \n Passes between McTominay and Weghorst \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Alvarez helps to expose Liverpool\u2019s 4-2-4 system \n Manchester City \u2019s laser-precision dismantling of  Liverpool  in the early Saturday kick-off was the result of a simple tactical victory for  Pep Guardiola  over  Jurgen Klopp . \n \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 1 \n \n LIV \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n This one was all about Man City\u2019s ability to pass through the thirds with relative ease as Guardiola\u2019s 3-2-5 formation allowed his players to stand in spaces unoccupied by Liverpool in their surprisingly aggressive 4-2-4 formation. \n The misalignment between the two styles is neatly captured in the still images taken from the build-up to Man City\u2019s crucial equaliser below. \n Klopp\u2019s front four blocked the pass into  Rodri  and  John Stones  but, with only two Liverpool central midfielders behind them, Man City\u2019s outside centre-backs were able to find straight passes into  Kevin De Bruyne  or  Ilkay Gundogan  who, once turned, had half the Liverpool team behind them. \n From here, Guardiola\u2019s very widely placed wingers  Riyad Mahrez  and  Jack Grealish  had space to drive at the Liverpool defence. \n In short,  Harvey Elliott  and  Diogo Jota  were standing too high to stop the pass into De Bruyne and Gundogan or drop and help their full-backs against Grealish and Mahrez. It was a pattern that happened again and again. \n Build-up to Man City's first goal \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Man City were assisted considerably by the performance of the jinking and gliding  Julian Alvarez , operating like a traditional Guardiola \"false nine\". The Argentinian\u2019s tap-in was very reminiscent of the goals scored by  Erling Haaland , but the rest of his performance was not. \n From his whipped no-look pass out to Mahrez ahead of the second goal to his intelligent link play twice in the run-up to the third, Alvarez showed qualities that are often lacking when Haaland is on the pitch. \n Alvarez averages 39.1 touches per 90 in the Premier League this season, considerably more than Haaland\u2019s 24.3, and produces 3.44 shot-creating actions compared with Haaland\u2019s 2.09. \n Alvarez's passes against Liverpool \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Jesus impact extends far beyond goals \n Alvarez wasn\u2019t the only one showing the value of a striker who gets involved in play outside the penalty box. \n Over at Emirates Stadium,  Gabriel Jesus  made his first league start since 12 November and instantly reminded everyone of what Arsenal had been missing, winning and then scoring a penalty before adding a second goal during his 60 minutes on the pitch. \n \n \n \n \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 1 \n \n LEE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Remarkably, by the time he was withdrawn, Jesus had already racked up 60 per cent more touches of the ball (55) than his stand-in  Eddie Nketiah  usually manages in an entire match (34.3 per 90). \n Nketiah did an excellent job from a goalscoring perspective \u2013 averaging 0.36 per match, not far off Jesus\u2019s 0.48 \u2013 but there is no matching Jesus\u2019s ability to drop between the lines, demand the ball, and twist and turn with an urgency that lifts his team-mates. \n Jesus's second goal \n \n \n Fantastic free-flowing football \u2764\ufe0f  pic.twitter.com/puD6HySYrm \n\u2014 Arsenal (@Arsenal)  April 2, 2023 \n \n Suddenly Arsenal have serious depth. The form of  Leandro Trossard , whose seven Premier League assists are the joint-highest number for the club despite him only joining in January, meant  Mikel Arteta  could afford to leave  Bukayo Saka  on the bench for the first time this season and still win comfortably. The Gunners are ramping up at exactly the right time. \n Hodgson unleashes Eze and goes for broke \n Roy Hodgson \u2019s return was supposed to signal the regression towards a more conservative  Crystal Palace  team and the shrunken, compact 4-4-2 formation that defined most of his previous tenure at Selhurst Park. Absolutely nobody saw what happened on Saturday coming. \n \n \n \n \n \n CRY \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 1 \n \n LEI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Palace\u2019s first victory in 13 matches featured 31 shots on goal, a joint club-record in the Premier League and four more than they mustered in their final four matches combined under  Patrick Vieira . \n Their 20 first-half shots were the most by any Premier League team in the opening 45 minutes since December 2015, when Liverpool hit the same total against the same opponents  Leicester City . \n What on earth happened? As the table below shows, it was preposterously out of character for Hodgson, whether compared with the last time he faced Leicester at home or compared with his final-season average at Palace in 2020/21. \n Palace attacking stats compared \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n v LEI, Dec 20 \n CRY ave. 20/21 \n v LEI, Apr 23 \n \n \n \n \n Possession \n 34% \n 41% \n 52% \n \n \n Shots \n 4 \n 9 \n 31 \n \n \n Shots on target \n 1 \n 3 \n 9 \n \n \n Progressive passes \n 16 \n 30 \n 59 \n \n \n Key passes \n 4 \n 7 \n 22 \n \n \n \n Put simply, Hodgson went for broke. Not only did he choose a 4-3-3 formation rather than 4-4-2, he gave  Eberechi Eze  a first start in central midfield since the  3-0 defeat to Everton  back in October. \n The new manager was rewarded with an outstanding performance as Eze set the tone by picking up the ball in deep areas and driving at the heart of the Leicester defence. The 24-year-old made the joint-most progressive carries, with five, and attempted the joint second-most take-ons, with four. \n Alongside  Wilfried Zaha ,  Michael Olise ,  Jeffrey Schlupp  and  Odsonne Edouard  \u2013 not to mention the two substitutes who combined for the winner,  Jordan Ayew  and  Jean-Philippe Mateta  \u2013 Hodgson crammed as many fast dribblers onto the pitch as he could, throwing the kitchen sink at a timidly retreating Leicester. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n The relegation fight \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Position \n Pos \n \n Club \n \n Played \n Pl \n \n GD \n \n Points \n Pts \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Chelsea \n CHE \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -9\n\n \n 44 \n \n \n \n 13 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Wolverhampton Wanderers \n WOL \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -27\n\n \n 41 \n \n \n \n 14 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n West Ham United \n WHU \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -13\n\n \n 40 \n \n \n \n 15 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Bournemouth \n BOU \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -34\n\n \n 39 \n \n \n \n 16 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Nottingham Forest \n NFO \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -30\n\n \n 38 \n \n \n \n 17 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Everton \n EVE \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -23\n\n \n 36 \n \n \n \n 18 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Leicester City \n LEI \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -17\n\n \n 34 \n \n \n \n 19 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Leeds United \n LEE \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -30\n\n \n 31 \n \n \n \n 20 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Southampton \n SOU \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -37\n\n \n 25 \n \n \n \n \n \n View More \n \n Chelsea defeat epitomises Potter era \n It was a fitting finale to the  Graham Potter  experiment: a  2-0 defeat to Aston Villa  defined by possession without penetration, strange tactical decisions, squad rotation and a huge dollop of bad luck. \n Chelsea\u2019s 3-4-3 formation always looked restrictive under Potter, resulting in sideways passing that lacked the verticality required to pull apart deep defences, so  Villa \u2019s stubbornness under  Unai Emery  was always going to present a difficult challenge. \n Chelsea's drop in attacking stats \n \n \n \n Stats per 90 \n Chelsea 21/22 \n Chelsea 22/23 \n \n \n \n \n Progressive passes \n 51.8 \n 44.9 \n \n \n Progressive carries \n 23.5 \n 20.9 \n \n \n Passes into final third \n 42.5 \n 37.6 \n \n \n Switches of play \n 2.7 \n 3.8 \n \n \n \n But Chelsea's chances of success were weakened by Potter fielding just one natural centre-back in his back three, as shown by the mix-up between Marc Cucurella and Kalidou Koulibaly that allowed Ollie Watkins to score the opener. \n What\u2019s more, Chelsea\u2019s front three of Kai Havertz, Joao Felix and Mykhailo Mudryk was remarkably narrow. This allowed Villa to stay in their resolutely compact shape for long periods of the match, as these average position graphs show. \n Chelsea's average positions v Villa \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Villa's average positions v Chelsea \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Then again, there\u2019s the \"Potter Curse\" to consider. His Brighton team underperformed against xG, and the same thing happened at Chelsea. \n The Blues had the worst xG differential (-7.4) of any Premier League side during his reign, which ended with 21 goals being scored from an xG of 28.4. Against Villa, they failed to score from a 2.0 xG \u2013 their highest tally in the league this season in a match in which they failed to register a goal. \n Potter ends his Chelsea career with the joint-lowest points-per-match average of any Chelsea manager who was in charge for 20 or more Premier League matches, with 1.27, and yet with better finishing it could all have been so different. \n Set-piece goal highlights small margins \n West Ham United  have 18 fewer points than at the same stage last season and the drop-off in performances has been plain to see. Yet the margins between success and failure are always slimmer than they appear. \n \n \n \n \n \n WHU \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 0 \n \n SOU \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Goals set the narrative agenda and sometimes just the slightest change in luck, or finishing, can recast perceptions of a performance, which then snowball into greater confidence and better results. \n It might be surprising to learn that West Ham\u2019s average xG (1.29) and xG against (1.11) this season are very similar to their averages last campaign (1.35 and 1.23 respectively). \n It is possible that only a small shift in perception would be needed for views of  David Moyes \u2019 football, seen by many supporters as overly cautious these days, to switch back to being lauded as pragmatic but effective. \n In fact, it might only take an uptick in set-piece success. \n Nayef Aguerd \u2019s winner in West Ham\u2019s crucial six-pointer against  Southampton  was only their third headed goal of the season and their fifth from a set-piece (the fourth-lowest total). \n This is a significant downturn from last year when the Hammers ended on eight headed goals and 14 from set-pieces (the fifth-most). \n Their crossing numbers are consistent, with 17.0 attempted and 4.1 successful last season, compared with 16.8 attempted and 4.4 successful this campaign. Meanwhile, their headed shots have dropped only slightly from 2.5 per match to 2.1, so it is not a question of making the chances. \n Just a bit more luck, or quality, from dead-balls and West Ham might look a lot healthier. \n",

It was Brighton\u2019s 14th own goal in the Premier League, the most of any club since their debut campaign in 2017/18. \u00a0 \n Brighton made four half-time changes but one of them,  Solly March , was in part responsible for Everton\u2019s fourth goal, as his loose pass was intercepted by  Alex Iwobi , who played in McNeil to round Steele and score. To make matters worse, March pulled up while tracking back and hobbled off injured. \n The Seagulls had 77 per cent possession and finally made it count on 79 minutes when  Kaoru Mitoma \u2019s shot rebounded off a post and hit  Alexis Mac Allister  and bounced in, and they might have set up a grandstand finish had  Jordan Pickford  not made three great saves to deny Mac Allister and  Evan Ferguson . \u00a0 \n Instead McNeil smashed in a brilliant fifth in stoppage time to boost Everton's chances of staying up and dent Brighton's European hopes. They remain seventh with 55 points, two behind  Tottenham Hotspur  but with two matches in hand. \n See:  How clubs qualify for Europe \n \n \n Are you entertained? \ud83e\udd29  pic.twitter.com/SwtTU0R9ps \n\u2014 Premier League (@premierleague)  May 8, 2023 \n \n Forest win battle of bottom two \n Nott'm Forest followed Everton's lead with a 4-3 win over bottom-club  Southampton  to rise from 19th to 16th and leave Saints needing to win their next match in order to avoid relegation. \n Taiwo Awoniyi  scored twice in three first-half minutes, converting  Brennan Johnson 's cross and volleying in a brilliant second for his first goals since Forest beat Saints in January's reverse fixture.\u00a0 \n Southampton responded through  Carlos Alcaraz  on 25 minutes but  Morgan Gibbs-White  restored the home side's two-goal cushion just before half-time with a penalty awarded for a foul on Johnson by  Ainsley Maitland-Niles .\u00a0 \n Ruben Selles  sent his team out early for the second half and the Saints manager got an instant response as  Lyanco  headed  James Ward-Prowse 's corner beyond  Keylor Navas .\u00a0 \n But at the other end Gibbs-White cleverly flicked to  Danilo  to score for a third straight match, and although Ward-Prowse struck a stoppage-time penalty, it was too late for a dramatic comeback.\u00a0 \n The result takes Forest on to\u00a033 points, one more than Everton and three clear of the drop zone. \n Saints have 24 points, eight from safety, meaning they will go down unless they beat  Fulham on Saturday . \n \n \n \n The relegation fight \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Position \n Pos \n \n Club \n \n Played \n Pl \n \n GD \n \n Points \n Pts \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 17 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Everton \n EVE \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -23\n\n \n 36 \n \n \n \n 18 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Leicester City \n LEI \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -17\n\n \n 34 \n \n \n \n 19 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Leeds United \n LEE \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -30\n\n \n 31 \n \n \n \n 20 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Southampton \n SOU \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -37\n\n \n 25 \n \n \n \n \n \n View More \n \n Leicester drop into bottom three \n Along with Southampton,  Leicester City \u00a0were the big losers of the day as they dropped into the relegation zone following a 5-3 defeat at  Fulham . \n Leicester were behind after only 10 minutes through  Willian \u2019s bending free-kick. It was the 17th time in their last 18 matches they had conceded the opening goal of a match. \n Fulham doubled their lead eight minutes later,  Harry Wilson 's pass being gathered by\u00a0 Carlos Vinicius  to finish low past  Daniel Iversen , and it was 3-0 before half-time thanks to  Tom Cairney \u2019s first Premier League goal since October 2020. \n After waiting more than two-and-a-half years for a PL goal, Cairney\u2019s next came just six minutes into the second half, finishing into the bottom corner after a surging run from  Kenny Tete  to make it 4-0. \n Leicester pulled one back just before the hour mark,  James Maddison  teeing up  Harvey Barnes  to smash in off the underside of the bar, and they\u00a0had a big chance to apply further pressure, but  Bernd Leno  denied  Jamie Vardy  from the penalty spot after the goalkeeper had fouled the striker. \n Vardy was made to pay for his miss, as just four minutes later Willian cut in from the left and curled in a wonderful strike for his second of the match.\u00a0 \n Leicester were given another chance from the penalty spot on 80 minutes, though, when  Palhinha  brought down Maddison, who succeeded where Vardy failed, sending Leno the wrong way. \n An eventful match did not end there, though, as Barnes completed his own brace, capitalising on poor Fulham defending to net the eighth and final goal of an end-to-end affair. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Fulham\u2019s 14th win of the season, their most in a Premier League campaign, solidifies their top-half status.

He was taught since he was born. Maybe I learned more off him than he did off me when we worked together.\" \n See:  Guardiola hails Arsenal as best team in the league \n Will Arteta freshen up his team? \n The consistency of Arteta's team selections has arguably been one of Arsenal's strengths this season. \n The Gunners have had the same starting XI for their last six matches and could now make it seven in a row for the first time in their Premier League history. \n However, there have been signs that the leaders may be tiring, and that now might be the moment for Arteta to freshen things up. \n After averaging 2.4 goals per match in the first half of the season, Arsenal have struggled in their last two outings, losing  1-0 at Everton  before drawing  1-1 at home against Brentford . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Arteta might be moved to hand  Leandro Trossard  his first Premier League start for Arsenal, in place of  Gabriel Martinelli , as the Belgian has impressed since moving from  Brighton & Hove Albion  and scored his first goal for the Gunners against Brentford on Saturday. \n Trossard started in Arsenal's recent 1-0 FA Cup defeat to City and, but for a superb save by  Stefan Ortega , might have opened his account for the club sooner. \n Having scored for Brighton against Man City in October, he could become the third player to strike against the Citizens for two different clubs in the same Premier League season, after  Andy Carroll  and  Darren Bent  in 2010/11. \n Takehiro Tomiyasu  might also get the nod.  Ben White  enjoys a productive partnership with  Bukayo Saka  on the right flank, with their combinations key to Arsenal\u2019s offensive threat, but Tomiyasu also played well in the cup defeat and might be deployed to keep  Jack Grealish  quiet. \n Much depends on whether Arteta decides to adopt a cautious approach or take the game to City. \n Has Guardiola found a winning formula? \n Man City have been below their imperious best this season, with Guardiola seemingly struggling to find the most effective personnel and tactics. But something clicked in Sunday\u2019s  3-1 win over Aston Villa . \n Having previously used  Joao Cancelo ,  Rico Lewis  or  Nathan Ake  as inverted full-backs who move into the centre of the pitch, Guardiola instead deployed  Bernardo Silva  in a deep-lying midfield role with responsibility for helping defensively out wide. \n The Portuguese had been benched for three of the previous four matches in all competitions, and the change instantly gave City more control in midfield. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Bernardo's technical quality took the pressure off  Rodri  in between the defence and attack, helping the champions to move the ball quickly and smoothly between the lines. Out of possession, Bernardo tracked the runs of  Leon Bailey . \n Meanwhile, experienced centre-backs  Ruben Dias  and  Aymeric Laporte  started together for the first time since the FIFA World Cup 2022 and helped restrict Villa to just six shots, with two on target. \n While it is always dangerous to try to predict Guardiola\u2019s plans, he may have found his winning formula just in time for the biggest match of the season so far. \n Can Arsenal change the record? \n Arsenal will be battling the weight of history on Wednesday, as they take on a side who have dominated them in recent years. \n They have lost their last 10 Premier League matches against Man City, their longest run against an opponent in their history. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n At home, the Gunners have suffered six straight defeats against Guardiola\u2019s side in all competitions, and City could now become the first team to win seven straight trips to Arsenal. \n Man City are the one team Arteta has failed to beat in the Premier League, losing all five of his meetings with them. \n Meanwhile, City have won their last 22 league matches played on a Wednesday, the longest winning run on a specific day in the competition's history. \n The omens are certainly not good for Arsenal, but the 2022/23 team are a new breed who have been proving doubters wrong all season, and they have turned Emirates Stadium into a fortress. \n They are unbeaten in 13 home league matches, winning 11 of those.

        "text": "\n When  Brighton & Hove Albion  trailed 1-0 away to Hereford United in the final match of the 1996/97 season, the idea that the Seagulls might one day play in Europe would have been dismissed as a cruel fantasy by the loyal fans on the away terrace at Edgar Street. \n Brighton faced relegation from the Football League, and had no home after the departing board of directors had sold the Goldstone Ground. \n And yet here we are. Fantasy has become reality, with Brighton booking a European place for the first time in their history, qualifying for the UEFA Europa League. \n Early struggles \n Robbie Reinelt\u2019s equaliser that sunny day in Hereford solved the first problem by keeping Brighton in the League, but Dick Knight, the new chairman, faced many battles before he could find an answer to the second. \n He had inherited an arrangement to ground-share at Gillingham\u2019s Priestfield Stadium, but it was 70 miles from Brighton. \n It took him two years to get the team back to their home city. But playing at Withdean Stadium, a council-owned 6,000-capacity athletics facility, with mostly open-air seating was an unsatisfactory \"temporary\" arrangement that lasted 12 years. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Withdean Stadium, seen here in 1999, was unsuited for football but Brighton's home for 12 years as they sought a new stadium\n             \n \n Life at Withdean was seldom dull, with managers including Micky Adams, Peter Taylor, Steve Coppell and Mark McGhee overseeing four promotions and two relegations, a playoff final and a defeat of  Manchester City  in the League Cup. \n But there were few available sites for a new permanent stadium, and very little money. \n Skint, the record label on which celebrity fan Fatboy Slim recorded, was a comment on the club\u2019s finances as well as the shirt sponsor. \n When a location for a stadium was found, a succession of planning rebuffs drained more funds. The fans signed petitions, went on marches and even sent Valentine cards to government ministers, before permission was finally granted. \n Bloom to the rescue \n Bankrolling the building of the new American Express Community Stadium (\"Amex\") was the next problem, overcome when Tony Bloom, a lifelong fan and the grandson of a former club vice-chairman, stepped forward. \n A maths graduate, Bloom had made a fortune in the world of betting and invested it wisely in property, so was able to fund the new ground in return for succeeding Knight as chairman. \n Bloom also transformed the team\u2019s fortunes by appointing  Gustavo Poyet  to his first job in management. Poyet established the passing ethos at the club and winning the League One title ensured that the new ground would host Championship football when it opened in 2011. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Gus Poyet and chairman Tony Bloom hold aloft the Division One trophy in 2011\n             \n \n The crowds who could not fit into Withdean returned and the initial capacity of 25,000 at the Amex was soon expanded to its present 31,800. \n Premier League promotion \n Now the target was the Premier League. Poyet, Oscar Garcia and  Chris Hughton  all fell at the first playoff hurdle, before Hughton succeeded at his second attempt with automatic promotion in 2017, Withdean veteran  Glenn Murray  the returning hero whose goals made the difference. \n The first two seasons back at the top were battles for safety, based on the defending of  Lewis Dunk  and  Shane Duffy , with the occasional victory over a top-six club or traditional rivals  Crystal Palace  to boost morale. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Lewis Dunk in action during Brighton's debut Premier League match against Manchester City in August 2017\n             \n \n Bloom knew something different was required to make his vision last.  Graham Potter  succeeded Hughton in 2019 with a brief to make the team younger and the football more entertaining. \n With the help of a recruitment department turbo-charged by access to Bloom\u2019s stats and algorithms, Potter led Brighton to an unprecedented ninth-place finish in 2022. \n The season ended strongly, thanks to the introduction of Ecuador midfield enforcer  Moises Caicedo , the latest in a series of bargain signings that paid off handsomely. \n Pundits predicted Brighton\u2019s demise when Potter and player of the season  Marc Cucurella  were head-hunted by  Chelsea  that autumn, but they reckoned without Bloom and CEO Paul Barber\u2019s meticulous succession planning. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Graham Potter and Marc Cucurella would eventually depart for Chelsea\n             \n \n A potential replacement is earmarked for every role in the club, from technical director to tea lady. \n Indeed, part of the sales pitch to new signings is that the club will not stand in their way if they want to move on to supposedly better things - with the important proviso that the price has to be right. \n Ready-made replacements \n So in came former Shakhtar Donetsk coach  Roberto De Zerbi  and Ecuador left-back  Pervis Estupinan , signed from Villarreal to replace Cucurella, for a fraction of the \u00a362million or so that Chelsea had paid. \n And when Belgium forward  Leandro Trossard  agitated for a move to  Arsenal , there was a ready-made replacement. Japan winger  Kaoru Mitoma  had been signed from Kawasaki Frontale for a bargain \u00a32.5m 15 months earlier and loaned out to Union Saint-Gilloise in Belgium, also owned by Bloom. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                The rise of Kaoru Mitoma has epitomised Brighton's savvy transfer dealings\n             \n \n See:  The story of Mitoma's rise to Brighton superstar \n To say that De Zerbi has been a revelation is an understatement. Fans who researched his Sassuolo side worried whether Brighton\u2019s defenders could cope with the risk/reward of his insistence on playing out from their own penalty area. \n But Dunk and company thrived on the challenge and the rest of the league looked on in bewilderment, as Brighton passed their way through them. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Despite coming to Brighton mid-season Roberto De Zerbi set targets for his players that they have exceeded\n             \n \n The Italian proved a master psychologist as well as a tactician. For example, he unlocked the potential that fans had always seen in  Solly March  and transformed the local lad into a confident Premier League performer, who was mentioned in the conversation about the England squad. \n De Zerbi spoke of Europe and the players believed. He set targets and they were surpassed. Ninth last season has become sixth this time round and the UEFA Europa League. \n \n \n This is special. \ud83e\udd70 Go inside our changing room with RDZ, Tony Bloom and this amazing group of players and staff... \ud83d\udc99\ud83e\udd0d  pic.twitter.com/xHmenA0fAB \n\u2014 Brighton & Hove Albion (@OfficialBHAFC)  May 22, 2023 \n \n What next? Will Brighton become the victims of their own success? Will resources be stretched by the European adventure? Will richer clubs come for more of their star players and can they continue to replace them if so? \n Perhaps most important, will De Zerbi himself be poached? \n He says not. \u201cFor me it is an honour to work here and continue to work here,\u201d he said after the Southampton match. \n \u201cI never thought to go back in Italy with another team or a Premier League team. I want to stay, I don\u2019t know how many years but I\u2019m enjoying a lot to work with these people.\u201d \n Now fans wait with mounting excitement to find out where the Albion adventure will take them next.

It's about the job at Manchester United and the bond we had over many years, so I'm also proud for the club, the staff and my players. \n \"My job was to send the fans home happy. United's history and my own expectations were the things that drove me and I then had to try and develop all my players with the same expectations and make sure we could go out and achieve them. \n \"I feel Arsene is a very worthy inductee as he transformed Arsenal Football Club fantastically. They became a tough team to compete with and we both wanted to win, which motivated us further. \n \"Through the years since retirement, we'd go for dinner together in a little restaurant he knows well in Switzerland. He is a really interesting man and I enjoy his company, but it is still my job to pick the wine!\" \n Arsene Wenger \n Arsene Wenger's 22 seasons in charge of Arsenal is a Premier League record. \n He won the Premier League three times and made history in 2003/04 as \"The Invincibles\" became the only team to win the title while remaining unbeaten throughout the entire campaign. \n Arriving as one of the first foreign managers in the Premier League in 1996, Wenger's impact was instantaneous and remarkable. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n He raised standards through a revolutionary football philosophy and commitment to playing attractive, attacking football, winning the title in 1997/98, his first full season with the club. \n Wenger oversaw an astute transfer strategy, including scouting abroad for talent, which notably brought about the signings of fellow Hall of Fame members  Thierry Henry  and  Patrick Vieira . \n He managed a record 828 Premier League matches, including 476 wins and 199 draws.

        "text": "\n After seeing his team let slip a two-goal lead late on to draw 3-3 with Southampton,  Tottenham Hotspur  head coach  Antonio Conte  expressed his anger at his players and beyond. \n Here is the transcript from his extraordinary post-match press conference at St Mary's Stadium.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n SOU \n \n \n \n \n 3 - 3 \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n A tough penalty decision to take but at 3-1 up with 15 minutes to go, should your team be drawing that match? Conte: \"If we are going to discuss about the penalty it means we don't want to see other situations. For the penalty for me it was not a penalty. I stop, we close the situation. The worst situation is what was happening on the pitch. What has been happening in the last few months, what's happening in this, my second season. \n \"I think that it's the right moment to speak because I think that after this performance, for me this is unacceptable. We are winning 3-1, in control of the game and you are able to concede two goals and to risk, because also Fraser [Forster] made a fantastic save in one situation. \n \"I think it's much better to go into the problem, because the problem is that for another time we showed that we are not a team. \n \"We are 11 players that go into the pitch. I see selfish players. I see players that don't want to help each other and don't put their heart [into it]. \n \"First of, today I prefer to hide this situation and to try to speak, to try to improve the spirit, the situation, with the words. With a lot of situations. Because about tactical or technical aspect, this is one situation. \n \"The most important thing if you want to become a strong team, if you want to become competitive, if you want to fight to win, is the desire, the fire that you need to have in your eyes, in your heart. And you have to show this in every moment. In every moment. \n \"If I have to compare last season and this season, I said to improve, now we are worse in this aspect. When you are not a team, everything can happen, in any moment. Today is the last situation. Don\u2019t forget that in the FA Cup we lost to Sheffield United, who played with young players. We were able with a strong team to be dropped in FA Cup. And then a lot of situations, I repeat, that we are not going to improve. And I am not speaking about tactical aspect or technical aspect. \n \"To be a team, to be a team, to be a team, this the most important thing. To understand that we play for the badge. We have to play to make our fans proud of us. We have to play to show desire. The fire in your eyes to win. If you have this, for sure, you don't go out in the FA Cup. Today, you win. Maybe, previously, in the other games, maybe, maybe something can change. \n \"But here, we're used to it for a long time. The club has the responsibility for the transfer market, every coach that stayed here has the responsibility. And the players? The players? Where are the players? About my experience, I can tell you that if you want to be competitive, if you want to fight, you have to improve this aspect. And now this aspect, for me, in this moment is really, really low. And I see only 11 players that play for themselves.\" \n Antonio, this is a difficult question to ask but do you think your position, the uncertainty over your future\u2026? Conte: \"You are finding an alibi, another alibi. You try to find an alibi, an excuse for the players. OK, continue, continue to do this, to find an excuse for the players. You do only this! You do only this. Excuses for the players. But the players, maybe, my future, then they lost confidence, they lost spirit, they lost being a team. Excuse. Excuse. Excuse. Try to protect, try to protect them every time. \n \"Come on, come on, come on. We are professional. We pay, the club paid us a lot of money. The players receive money, me receive money, you understand? Not to find excuse and don't have spirit or don't show a sense of belonging or don't show a sense of responsibility because we are showing this. And for me this is unacceptable, for me. Because this is the first time in my career to see a situation like this. And until now I wasn't able to change, not to change but compare to last season the situation went to become worst.\" \n Why is it happening? Conte: \"Why? I don't know because they are used to it here. They are used to it here. They don't play for something important, yeah. They don't want to play under pressure, they don't want to play under stress. It is easy in this way. \n \"Tottenham's story is this. Twenty years there is the owner and they never won something, but why? The fault is only for the club, or for every manager that stay here? I have seen the managers that Tottenham had on the bench. You risk to disrupt the figure of the manager and to protect the other situation in every moment. \n \"And now, until now I try to hide the situation but now, no, because I repeat I don't want to see what I have seen today because this is unacceptable also for the respect for the fans. They follow us, pay [for] the tickets and to see the team another time to have this type of performance, for me, I repeat, this is unacceptable. We have to think a lot, we have to think a lot about this.\" \n You saw the fire last week. What has changed? Conte: \"I said that I want to see the fire, not that I have seen. It is different. I said that I want to see the fire in their eyes. I want to see the fire in their hearts. I want to see the right spirit. OK, not only in the training session, in the pitch. Because here you have to make the difference. And I am not seeing this. \n \"And until now I try to hide the situation but now, there are 10 games to go and something thinks that we can fight. Fight for what with this spirit? With this attitude? With this commitment? For what? For seventh, eighth, 10th place? I am not used to this position. I\u2019m really upset and everyone has to take their responsibility. \n \"Not only the club, not only the manager, the staff. The players have to be involved in this situation because it is time to change this situation if Tottenham want to change. If they want to continue in this way, they can change manager, a lot of managers, but the situation cannot change. Believe me. \n \"Thank you very much.\" \n \u00a0\n \n \ud83c\udfa5 Highlights: Southampton 3-3 Spurs  pic.twitter.com/GB7C7vibIX \n\u2014 Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial)  March 18, 2023 \n \n",

But, from an Expected Goals (xG) score of 2.54 they managed only one goal, and  Chris Wood  punished their profligacy with a late equaliser from  Nottingham Fores t 's only shot on target. \n \n \n \n \n \n NFO \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 1 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n \"In the first half, it should already be two or three-zero, we conceded one shot on target and we dropped points,\" lamented  Pep Guardiola . \"It was a brilliant performance, we played really good but we didn't score.

        "text": "\n Alex Keble looks at how  Erik ten Hag \u00a0got the better of  Pep Guardiola \u00a0in their last head-to-head and how that might impact the tactical battle in the FA Cup final on Saturday 3 June, 15:00 BST. \n Man City v Man Utd \n The first-ever FA Cup final between  Manchester City  and\u00a0 Manchester United  is about more than just winning silverware. \n Man Utd, desperate to prevent their rivals from emulating their 1999 treble, have never had so much motivation to beat Man City in the Guardiola era. They may never have felt more confident of their chances, either. \n The Red Devils are one of just five clubs to have beaten Man City in all competitions this season, winning 2-1 at Old Trafford on 14 January. Like the other four, they rode their luck at times but emerged victorious with a defensive approach that focused on a deep line of engagement, narrowing the pitch, and springing forward on the counter-attack. \n \n \n \n \n \n MUN \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 1 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Things have shifted since January, when Man City were drifting through a post-World Cup fog, but nevertheless there is reason to assume Saturday\u2019s final could have a similar tactical pattern to their most recent head-to-head. \n Guardiola will have new ideas up his sleeve, as will the ever-adaptable Ten Hag. But one thing is certain: both managers will be poring over Man Utd\u2019s 2-1 win for clues. \n How United stopped and countered City \n Following  Man City\u2019s 6-3 win \u00a0in the reverse fixture at the beginning of October, a match defined by a daring United press with predictably disastrous results, Ten Hag decided to abandon his usual principles for a considerably more conservative style of football for the return fixture. \n They lined up in a narrow 4-2-3-1 formation, with  Bruno Fernandes  pushed out to the right wing and  Fred  parachuted in to add an extra defensive presence in the middle of the pitch. \n The basic idea was to sit off Man City (without dropping too deep and inviting pressure) and block the route to goal with man-to-man marking in midfield, before attacking quickly with spring-loaded counters launched via Fernandes to runners  Marcus Rashford  and  Anthony Martial . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                How Man Utd lined up against Man City in January 2023\n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                How Man City lined up at Man Utd in January 2023\n             \n \n The thinking was relatively simple: Man City will cut open any team who try to play through them or, by pressing high, leave gaps in their own shape. But Guardiola\u2019s side can become stuck when forced to break down a stubborn wall of bodies and, with such a high defensive line of their own, City can be vulnerable to fast breaks hit over the top. \n The most interesting aspect of United\u2019s plan was the man-to-man marking. Fred followed  Kevin De Bruyne ,  Casemiro  kept tight to  Bernardo Silva , and  Christian Eriksen  tracked  Rodri , while  Raphael Varane  was even given licence to push on to  Erling Haaland  when he dropped deep. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Man Utd adopted a man-to-man marking approach, with Fred, Casemiro and Christian Eriksen staying tight to their opposite midfielder\n             \n \n As a consequence, Man Utd recorded only 0.6 Expected Goals Against (xGA), their third-lowest total in any Premier League match in 2022/23, plus they held only 30 per cent possession and had 65 touches of the ball in the attacking third, on both counts their lowest numbers this season. \n But, you could argue Guardiola\u2019s tactical decisions were equally to blame for Ten Hag\u2019s success. \n He fielded just one defensive midfielder (Rodri) rather than a double-pivot and used both of his full-backs in a traditional manner, with neither player pushing into central midfield or staying deep to form a back three, as you can see in the above image. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n That meant two things: first, Man City found it harder to pass through a central midfield in which Man Utd had a numerical advantage and chose to suffocate with their deep shape, and second, it left them vulnerable to the hosts\u2019 counter-attacks down the wings \u2013 behind the full-backs and either side of a two-man central defence. \n Fernandes starting on the right wing and Rashford on the left was a masterstroke. Since Man Utd rarely scurried into a deep 4-5-1, instead holding that midblock you see above, Ten Hag\u2019s most important attackers were regularly in quite narrow and high areas of the pitch \u2013 ready to interact with one another on the break. \n Man City did not have enough bodies back to deal with this, either in the defensive line (to track Rashford or Martial) or in the midfield line (to help Rodri stop Fernandes from pinging long balls over the top). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Bruno Fernandes played a number of long passes over the full-backs to Marcus Rashford, something Man City struggled to deal with\n             \n \n It was a pattern that repeated again and again. Man Utd had six \"direct attacks\" this match, their joint-most of the season, and were caught offside six times, their second-highest. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Bruno Fernandes's pass map v Man City (H). Man Utd had six \"direct attacks\" in this match, their joint-most of the season\n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Put together, then, Man City were forced into harmless sideways passes out to the only free men, the wide full-backs, and couldn\u2019t get to grips with United\u2019s simple long-ball breaks. \n Guardiola switches it up, Ten Hag reacts \n That first-half pattern ultimately set the tone and, in the second, both of Man Utd\u2019s goals came from a similar form of counter-attack. But when considering how Saturday\u2019s FA Cup final will go, it is important to look at how Guardiola adapted to the game \u2013 and how Ten Hag hit back again. \n Noticing the problems as detailed above, Guardiola rejigged and plugged the gaps (temporarily, at least) in the second half, by instructing  Joao Cancelo  to come into central midfield, helping shut down Fernandes and give City greater control. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Joao Cancelo's first-half touch map, when he was deployed as a traditional left-back\n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Joao Cancelo's second-half touch map, when he moved into central midfield\n             \n \n Who knows why Guardiola started with his full-backs in \"normal\" positions (perhaps he saw United\u2019s full-backs as weak links City could target), but seeing it left his team exposed, he adapted accordingly. \n Now that Man City had greater control of the territory, looking more like their usual selves, De Bruyne popped up on the right more often, which was too wide for Fred to follow in the man-to-man system. \n Having escaped his marker, De Bruyne began to control the match \u2013 crossing from the right to set up  Jack Grealish \u2019s opener. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Fred (circled) looks on as Kevin De Bruyne crosses for Jack Grealish to score the opener\n             \n \n But Ten Hag reacted, bringing on the game-changer  Alejandro Garnacho  for Eriksen in a bold attacking substitution that meant Man Utd now had three quick attackers (Antony, Rashford, and Garnacho) for Man City to track. \n Within 10 minutes, Man Utd were 2-1 up. The renewed counter-attacking threat, piling pressure on the still-advancing Man City, exposed those first-half gaps more than ever. \n What\u2019s most notable about both United goals was the absence of a third central defender, with  Kyle Walker  chasing back too late to track Fernandes - and missing from shot altogether for Garnacho\u2019s winner. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Kyle Walker chases back too late and is unable to prevent Bruno Fernandes from scoring\n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Kyle Walker isn't in shot as Alejandro Garnacho sets up Marcus Rashford to score the winner\n             \n \n In the final tactical move of a complex strategic battle between the two managers, Ten Hag switched to a 5-2-3 in the closing moments to see the match out. \n Watch:  Man Utd 2-1 Man City highlights \n Different Man City this time around \n To an extent things will be different on Saturday, because Man City are in a very different place psychologically. \n The sharpness of their passing and counter-pressing has increased markedly since those sticky January days, and that alone might be enough for Guardiola to presume he doesn\u2019t need to worry about a repeat performance. \n But he will have learnt tactical lessons, too, and the worrying news for Man Utd fans is that patching up the problems from the Old Trafford defeat only requires City to play their usual game. Or, to use a more loaded phrase, Man City should be much improved as long as their manager doesn\u2019t overthink things. \n It is likely Guardiola will start with his now-common 3-2-2-3 formation, the \"W-M\" that sees one full-back drop into a back three and the other join Rodri in central midfield. \n Cancelo\u2019s second-half positional move changed the dynamic of the last Manchester derby, if not the outcome, and so beginning with one full-back (or centre-back) stepping into midfield on Saturday ought to make United\u2019s man-to-man marking in midfield less effective, give City greater control and fluency in their own build-up while shielding against Fernandes\u2019s longer passing. \n Meanwhile playing Walker on the right of the back three, as Guardiola generally has done over the last few months, could eradicate the kind of space that led to Man Utd\u2019s two goals in January. \n We might also see a slightly more conservative initial team selection. Rather than field Silva alongside De Bruyne, Guardiola may pick Ilkay Gundogan and use him in a double pivot with Rodri in certain areas of the pitch, further cementing City\u2019s control. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                How Man City could line up in the FA Cup final against Man Utd on Saturday\n             \n \n Man Utd, however, should stick to a broadly similar approach. They will concede possession and territory in the hope of squeezing out space, especially if De Bruyne is unable to recover from his injury in time. \n Nevertheless both sides are in a different place four months on from their last head-to-head. Consequently all we can guarantee is another complex contest defined as much by in-game changes and substitutions as the initial tactical battle. \n And there is always the chance that one of these two managers does something entirely unexpected. In the pre-match press conference back in January, Guardiola raised an eyebrow when discussing Man Utd: \u201cI have a few ideas, thoughts \u2013 ridiculous ones.\u201d \n After losing the last match to Ten Hag, Guardiola could still be ruminating on those \u201cridiculous\u201d thoughts.\u00a0 \n",

        "text": "\n Following a thrilling weekend, delivering drama from top to bottom in the Premier League, Alex Keble looks at the key talking points and tactical lessons. \n Forest secure safety against the odds \n Steve Cooper  has performed a miracle.  Nottingham Forest  won promotion to the Premier League last season despite being bottom of the EFL Championship when Cooper arrived in September 2021, and after changing almost their entire squad last summer they were given no chance of staying up. \n \n \n \n \n \n NFO \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 0 \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Somehow he has done it, winning an incredible 30 points at the City Ground to ensure Forest get a second year in the top flight. But if the journey itself was unpredictable, by now the manner in which they would get over the line had become obvious enough. Forest\u2019s 1-0 victory over  Arsenal  went almost exactly as we had predicted: an Arsenal team weakened by injury were stumped by Cooper\u2019s low block and then hit through the middle of the pitch by Forest\u2019s counter-attacking front three. \n They were assisted by a series of enforced Arsenal changes that further undermined the visitors\u2019 usual slick football. With almost everything coming down Forest\u2019s left-hand side, the job was simpler than usual. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Arsenal's attacks were mostly focused down their right flank, but the Gunners could not get past Forest\n             \n \n From a hunched and determined defensive shell, and with just 18 per cent possession - the lowest tally on record for a winning team in the Premier League - Cooper\u2019s side just had to wait for their one chance, which came from a misplaced pass from  Martin Odegaard . \n That moment - that rare act of carelessness from the captain - captured Arsenal\u2019s sudden decline since  Manchester City  took control of the title race. The Gunners have lost three of their last five league matches, as many as in their first 32, and have now failed to score in successive matches for the first time in 2022/23. \n But Arsenal are not the story here. Cooper and Forest have rallied from nowhere to win 10 points from their last five matches. They will, against all odds, be a Premier League team again next season. \n Fickle Spurs show their best and worst \n After the most chaotic of Premier League campaigns,  Tottenham Hotspur  supporters endured a fitting tribute to the year they have witnessed. The 3-1 defeat to  Brentford  really did encapsulate the story of their season: in short,  Harry Kane \u2019s brilliance failing to cover for the team sinking into passive resistance. \n \n \n \n \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 3 \n \n BRE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n For the first 45 minutes, the Spurs players in  Ryan Mason \u2019s 4-2-4 formation aggressively pressed Brentford and forced them back through sheer weight of attacking numbers.  Yves Bissouma  produced his best performance in a Spurs shirt and managed to control central midfield as part of a two with  Oliver Skipp , while the forward line put concerted pressure on  David Raya \u2019s goal. \n But it could not last and after the break, with the more elegant  Mikkel Damsgaard  brought on to grab some control in the middle, Brentford took advantage of Spurs slipping into old habits. In the first half Spurs led on tackles attempted (13 to six) and fouls committed (seven to three), but in the second half Brentford made twice as many tackles (10 to five) and committed more fouls (six to four). \n Note the difference between the images below. The first shows a typical first-half scene for Spurs that led to Skipp winning a tackle and launching a counter. The second image shows the build-up to Brentford\u2019s second goal. The hosts went from pressing the Brentford midfielders to sitting off, giving the visitors space to pick their passes. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                The arrows show how quick Spurs were to close down a Brentford player or get to the ball first\n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                By contrast, in the second half Spurs couldn't get anywhere near the Brentford players\n             \n \n Suddenly, Spurs' 4-2-4 shape looked light on numbers in central midfield and they collapsed once again, a perhaps inevitable occurrence considering Mason is attempting to reverse years of coaching under cautious reactive tacticians like  Jose Mourinho  and  Antonio Conte . \n He has been unable to arrest the decline; unable to inspire attacking football that can be sustained for a full 90 minutes. \n The headline statistic says it all: Spurs' 2022/23 campaign is only the second time in a 38-match Premier League season that a team have both scored and conceded 60+ goals (66 scored, 62 conceded). \n Firmino has changed how we see strikers \n Roberto Firmino \u2019s tearful Anfield farewell on Saturday was marked by a goal, giving  Liverpool  supporters \u2013 and manager  Jurgen Klopp  - the opportunity to serenade a club legend before he departs this summer. \n \n \n \n \n \n LIV \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 1 \n \n AVL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n \u201cYou can imagine Bobby, my God, how much I love the guy,\u201d Klopp said after the match. It\u2019s easy to see why. \n Firmino wasn\u2019t just a crucial part of Klopp\u2019s first Liverpool team, the central point of a three-pronged attack with  Sadio Mane  and  Mohamed Salah  that won the UEFA Champions League in 2019 and Premier League in 2020. \n No, Firmino helped redefine what a striker could be. English football had little time for non-goalscoring centre-forwards before the Brazilian, and certainly prior to his emergence under Klopp, the Premier League had no real concept of what a \"false nine\" was. \n In fact, it was years before Firmino gained mainstream acceptance outside Liverpool; before neutrals began to appreciate just how much he gave to the Liverpool team with his subtle and intelligent link-play outside the penalty area. \n These days, tactical awareness has moved on to such an extent that even the record-breaking  Erling Haaland  is critiqued for what he contributes outside the box. But it didn\u2019t used to be that way. \n Firmino changed how we see strikers and, appropriately, half of his eight touches in Saturday's cameo against  Aston Villa  were taken in his own half. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Roberto Firmino's eight touches after coming on as 72nd-minute substitute against Villa\n             \n \n Nevertheless he scored the equaliser and, in the process, set a personal record for his most Premier League goals at Anfield in a season, with nine. \n In fact, Firmino is 16th on Liverpool\u2019s all-time goalscorer list, set to leave with 110 goals and 72 assists in 362 matches. Not bad for a supposedly \"false nine\". \n Foden excels in No 10 role \n Throughout a sleepy end-of-season match at Etihad Stadium, heavily impacted by  Pep Guardiola \u2019s nine changes to the starting XI, supporters were mostly just waiting for the Trophy lift. \n \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 0 \n \n CHE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n But the ease with which  Manchester City  overcame  Chelsea  - the 1-0 scoreline barely reflecting their control of the match - was an apt way to celebrate what has, in retrospect, been another season of total domination for the champions. \n There are 15 instances of teams winning 12 consecutive matches in English top-flight history and Guardiola\u2019s Man City are responsible for five of them. They have scored 100 goals at home this season in all competitions, equalling a record that they set themselves. They are now on course to win the league by 10 clear points. \n We are in the era of Man City. That is not new information, but for City and England fans there was one interesting nugget from Sunday\u2019s match:  Phil Foden  was superb as a gliding all-action No 10. \n Foden floated neatly between the lines to connect with  Julian Alvarez , completing a season-high nine progressive passes to open Chelsea up and set the tempo in the first half. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Phil Foden's passes as a No 10 against Chelsea\n             \n \n Foden\u2019s game time in central areas has been limited by  Kevin De Bruyne  and, with  Jack Gealish  enjoying a brilliant season on the left, Foden has been given fewer league starts (20) than in either of the last two campaigns. \n Yet still he has a personal best of 16 Premier League goal contributions this season. After Sunday\u2019s showing, perhaps Foden can expect a few more starts in central midfield next campaign. \n Everton in control of three-way relegation fight \n Everton  have gained control in the battle against the drop, thanks to the latest goal the club have ever scored in the Premier League, an equaliser in the ninth minute of stoppage time from  Yerry Mina  at  Wolverhampton Wanderers . \n \n \n \n \n \n WOL \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 1 \n \n EVE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n After  Leeds United fell to a 3-1 defeat at West Ham United , Everton are now two points clear of the relegation zone. \n Sean Dyche \u2019s side also have the most straightforward final match and can secure safety with victory at  home to AFC Bournemouth  on the final day. \n \n \n \n The relegation battle \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Position \n Pos \n \n Club \n \n Played \n Pl \n \n GD \n \n Points \n Pts \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 17 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Everton \n EVE \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -23\n\n \n 36 \n \n \n \n 18 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Leicester City \n LEI \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -17\n\n \n 34 \n \n \n \n 19 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Leeds United \n LEE \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -30\n\n \n 31 \n \n \n \n 20 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Southampton \n SOU \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -37\n\n \n 25 \n \n \n \n \n \n See the full table \n \n Everton might not have enjoyed a major lift under Dyche, but another late equaliser \u2013 their third in the 89th minute or later since the beginning of April \u2013 has at least shown a fighting spirit. \n That is perhaps more than can be said about  Leeds United , who were limp at  West Ham  and deserving losers in the first truly winnable fixture of  Sam Allardyce \u2019s short interim spell. \n Leeds' style of football has changed under new management yet the end result is the same, and they\u00a0have now gone eight Premier League matches without a win. They haven\u2019t kept a clean sheet since February. \n It leaves them needing to beat Spurs on the final day while hoping Everton lose to  AFC Bournemouth \u00a0along with Leicester failing to defeat West Ham, which Allardyce has acknowledged means there is only a \u201cslim chance \u2013 but we have to hang on to that.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n EVE \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 0 \n \n BOU \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n LEE \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 4 \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n \u201cOur quality at both ends is what we lack, to defend better and create more opportunities,\u201d Allardyce said. \u201cThose two critical areas are particularly disappointing for us and when you are looking for your substitutes to make a difference, none of them did.\u201d \n He ended his post-match press conference crossing his fingers, saying he \u201choped\u201d Leeds would be a Premier League club next season.

Alex Keble looks at the key talking points and tactical lessons. \n Jorginho\u2019s measured control gives Arsenal hope \n Throughout  Arsenal \u2019s four-match winless run they lacked control - over the contests and over their feelings. From blowing two-goal leads to conceding inside the opening minute, they missed a soothing presence to recycle possession and add some simple elegance into the heart of things.

In hindsight, maybe  Mikel Arteta  could have played Jorginho more, especially considering  Thomas Partey \u2019s recent decline in form. \n Jorginho wasn\u2019t flashy in the 2-0 win at  Newcastle United , but he constantly demanded possession from the base of midfield, gracefully passing the ball around the corner to manoeuvre Arsenal around an aggressive Newcastle press. \n The knock-on effect of having a player who breaks a press, moves the team into commanding territory and sucks the atmosphere out of a raucous stadium cannot be overstated. \n Jorginho\u2019s statistics v Newcastle \n \n \n 1 - Jorginho led all  @Arsenal  players today for...

His six shots were his joint-most in a Premier League match without scoring, while  Ilkay Gundogan  missed a penalty as the hosts found it easy to sweep through an ultra-defensive Leeds shape. \n Allardyce's players sat behind the ball and crowded the central areas, but having had so little time to work with his team, there were inevitably a few mistakes. Most notably, Leeds dropped five to 10 yards too deep once City worked the ball to the edge of the penalty area, enabling Gundogan to score two near-identical goals from unmarked positions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Leeds were too deep in these moments, allowing Gundogan to arrive late into space to score\n             \n \n Credit goes to  Pep Guardiola  for anticipating the extreme defensive caution and picking a more ambitious attacking line-up to counter-act it. Although we have seen Gundogan sweep the ball home from this position before, it is never usually when he has started as the deepest City midfielder. \n The decision to play Gundogan over  Rodri  was, presumably, designed to give City an extra man in attack. Leeds probably did not expect to have to track a third City midfielder. In the above image, note that Man City have seven players in the box at the moment the ball is struck. \n Gundogan's second goal v Leeds \n \n \n D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \ud83d\udcad @Mahrez22  \ud83e\udd1d  @IlkayGuendogan   pic.twitter.com/FpcydEZXJb \n\u2014 Manchester City (@ManCity)  May 6, 2023 \n \n Leeds are running out of time, and it doesn\u2019t get much easier. Allardyce has six days to recalibrate their defensive shape before the visit of Newcastle who, prior to their loss against Arsenal, had scored 13 goals in three outings. \n As for Guardiola's side, they are just beginning a sequence of matches against opponents all likely to cram the penalty area as Newcastle did. With  Sean Dyche \u2019s  Everton  up next, they will need Haaland\u2019s finishing to return to normal. \n Kane\u2019s one-man show continues \n Harry Kane \u2019s headed winner against  Crystal Palace  lifted him above  Wayne Rooney  in the  all-time Premier League goalscorers  list with 209. \n See:\u00a0 Kane beats Rooney's tally and sets record for headed goals \n He is now 51 goals short of  Alan Shearer 's record, having played 124 fewer matches.

This is particularly the case when it comes to assists. While Kane\u2019s numbers here aren\u2019t particularly strong (46), he is one of the Premier League's most creative players, producing 125 shot-creating actions this season, the 11th-highest in the division and first among No 9s. \n As for goals, Kane\u2019s numbers are phenomenal, and invaluable to his team. He has scored 41 per cent of Spurs' total league goals this season, the highest share of any player in the competition, while his goals have won 24 points. \n See:  The race for Europe \n Everton counters shake Brighton\u2019s high-wire act \n Even when there\u2019s a neat tactical nugget to talk about \u2013 something that cleanly defines how a match was won \u2013 it rarely plays out with quite such consistency. \n \n \n \n \n \n BHA \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 5 \n \n EVE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n All five of Everton\u2019s goals in a surprise 5-1 win at Brighton came on the counter-attack, each one mirroring the last as an expression of Brighton\u2019s over-expansion on the ball and of  Dwight McNeil \u2019s importance to  Sean Dyche . \n Everton\u2019s victory was created in two parts. First, Dyche\u2019s defensive coaching saw Everton stick rigidly to marking the spaces; to staying in their shape and refusing to be dragged around by the confusing and complex movement of  Roberto De Zerbi\u2019 s players. They were stubborn, and it meant Brighton couldn\u2019t find room to create. \n The second part took advantage of Brighton\u2019s all-out attacking high-wire act, evoking memories of De Zerbi's early days. Brighton often committed both full-backs and one centre-back forward, leaving a single defender back to cope with Everton counters led by McNeil and  Alex Iwobi . \n In the image below, the run-up to Everton\u2019s match-changing second goal is clear.  Abdoulaye Doucoure  eventually turns up unmarked at the back post to score because it is far more difficult to track players when the whole team are sprinting back to help. Brighton only had one centre-back in place \u2013 missing a second calm head who could have kept track of the Everton runners. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Everton's counter-attack catches Brighton short at the back\n             \n \n It happened again and again, until Everton had scored five away goals in the Premier League for the first time since December 2018. Not since April 2021, when  West Bromich Albion beat Chelsea 5-2 , had a team starting the day in the bottom three won at a side in the top seven. \n McNeil, with two goals, an assist and the delivery that forced an own goal from  Jason Steele , took his goal involvements for the season to 10, a career-high for a man clearly enjoying himself since being reunited with Dyche. As at Burnley, the move towards fast breaks has released McNeil\u2019s best qualities, giving Everton renewed hope of safety. \n See:  The relegation battle \n The  visit of Man City  next weekend no longer looks quite so daunting for Everton. Guardiola is going to need a special plan to contain McNeil. \n Free-scoring Forest back in the mix \n The wildest of Bank Holiday Mondays, in which 21 goals were scored across only three matches, ended with a crucial victory for  Nottingham Forest .\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n NFO \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 3 \n \n SOU \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Forest are three points clear of the relegation zone after another brilliant attacking performance from  Morgan Gibbs-White ,  Taiwo Awoniyi \u00a0and  Danilo . \n Awoniyi\u2019s presence up front has become an increasingly important focal point of Forest's attack, and his brace \u2013 his first since May 2022 in the Bundesliga \u2013 signalled his arrival as an effective Premier League striker. \n Of greater importance was the constant threat of Gibbs-White countering through the middle of the pitch, complemented by  Brennan Johnson \u2019s running, and the late arrivals of Danilo, who, with four goal contributions in his last three matches, is a candidate for the best signing of the January window. \n Danilo netted the all-important fourth goal against  Southampton , assisted by a cheeky flick from Gibbs-White that epitomised his swagger since  Steve Cooper  tweaked things a few matches ago.

        "text": "\n With plenty more drama guaranteed at both ends of the table in Matchweek 31, Alex Keble looks at the key talking points. \n What is Smith's plan for Leicester? \n As  Dean Smith arrives at Leicester City , it will be interesting to see what style of football he will look to implement. \n During his time as  Brentford  manager, the Bees played expressive, attacking football. Smith brought that approach to  Aston Villa  in 2018/19, triggering a 10-match winning streak in the Championship that was followed by a difficult first season in the top flight. \n After 28 matches of his debut campaign as a Premier League manager, Villa - who were far too easy to play through - had only 25 points and seemed destined for the drop.\u00a0 \n When the pandemic triggered a three-month hiatus in early March 2020, Smith and  John Terry , now at Leicester too, worked on a new defensive shape. Villa abandoned their old principles of passing out from the back and attacking in high numbers. \n Instead, they reverted to a backs-to-the-wall system that sought to limit opposition chances, minimise risks and launch counters through  Jack Grealish . Eight points from the final four matches justified the sudden overhaul. \n Villa's change of approach in 2019/20 \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n First 28 matches \n Last 10 matches \n \n \n \n \n Possession \n 45.7% \n 39.3% \n \n \n Defensive third touches/90 \n 197.2 \n 151.7 \n \n \n Miscontrols/90 \n 15.3 \n 11.8 \n \n \n Dispossessions/90 \n 8.9 \n 6.5 \n \n \n Points \n 23 \n 10 \n \n \n \n It seems likely that Smith will use this template at Leicester - certainly for such a tough opening match at  Manchester City , and especially with the Foxes so often porous when pushing up under  Brendan Rodgers . \n Man City have scored more goals from high turnovers than any other side, with nine, while Leicester have faced the most shots from high turnovers in the Premier League this season, with 50. \n \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n 3 - 1 \n \n LEI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Leicester\u2019s expansive possession style has actually been getting worse over time. They have held more than 60 per cent possession on six occasions in the Premier League this season and lost all six matches. \n They have also picked up just two points across their top 10 Premier League matches for possession share. Smith, then, might not want so much of the ball. \n James Maddison , so often compared to Grealish, can be lethal on the break so Smith may similarly funnel attacks through a man who has scored in each of his last two visits to the Etihad Stadium. \n An ultra-defensive formation seems the best way to approach the trip to Man City, and it could even be Smith's template through April and May. \n West Ham a tough challenge for Arsenal? \n The general perception that  West Ham United  are struggling for points has rapidly become outdated. \n The Hammers have picked up 15 points from their last 10 Premier League outings, an average of 1.5 points per match equal to the one set across their successful 2021/22 season. \n \n \n \n \n \n WHU \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 2 \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n What has changed? The simplest explanation is that West Ham have either got luckier with their shots or have improved their finishing. \n Across their first 19 matches of the season they scored 15 goals from an Expected Goals (xG) tally of 23.5, but over the last 10 have scored 12 from an xG of 13.4. \n Their goals scored to xG difference of \u201311.4 remains the biggest in the Premier League, but it is closing rapidly. \n Whatever the reason, this will not be an easy match for  Arsenal  despite West Ham\u2019s  5-1 home defeat to Newcastle United  earlier this month. This won\u2019t be news to  Mikel Arteta , who will recall  David Moyes \u2019 side went 1-0 up in the reverse fixture at Emirates Stadium, only for Arsenal to turn it around and  win 3-1 . \n The Gunners will try to avoid another scare like that. \n Arsenal\u2019s setback last weekend in what was an emotionally-charged  2-2 draw at Anfield  demands a strong and confident response. Any supporters relaxed about facing a relegation candidate should beware that West Ham are in better form than most people realise. \n Cooper's new shape can frustrate Man Utd\u00a0 \n Nottingham Forest  are without a win in nine matches and sinking fast, yet a noteworthy tactical tweak in the  2-0 defeat at Aston Villa  last weekend makes the visit of  Manchester United  on Sunday one worth keeping an eye on. \n \n \n \n \n \n NFO \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 2 \n \n MUN \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n For the second time this season  Steve Cooper  used a Villa match to try something new. Back in October, following a five-match losing streak, Cooper abandoned his adventurous football for something considerably more conservative in a  1-1 draw  with Villa. \n This prompted a sequence of 18 points won from the next 12 matches, during which time their average possession share fell from 44.5 per cent to 36.5 per cent. \n But eventually the opposition caught up with his change and so Cooper went back to Villa for another experiment \u2013 this time with a 3-4-2-1 formation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Despite losing at Villa Park, wing-backs  Neco Williams  and  Harry Toffolo  looked more comfortable with an extra centre-back behind them. Meanwhile, the use of two No 10s in  Danilo  and  Morgan Gibbs-White  allowed Forest to go man-for-man against  Douglas Luiz  and  John McGinn , stopping Villa from building through the middle. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Danilo and Morgan Gibbs-White go man-for-man on Douglas Luiz and John McGinn\n             \n \n This capacity to block the centre will be crucial against a Man Utd team welcoming back  Casemiro , especially if  Erik ten Hag  decides to keep  Bruno Fernandes  in a deeper playmaking role. \n Whatever the configuration, a stubbornly defensive Forest side with a new back five stand a chance. After all, United have lost three of their last four away matches. \n Can Villa squeeze into Europe? \n Since  Unai Emery \u2019s first Premier League match as Villa manager in November, only Arsenal and Man City have picked up more points or won more matches. \n \n \n \n \n \n AVL \n \n \n \n \n 3 - 0 \n \n NEW \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n His record reads 35 points from 17 contests, or 2.1 per match, which over the course of a 38-match season would equal 78 points. \n In nine of the last 10 seasons, that tally would be enough to finish in the top three, and as runners-up on three occasions. \n It\u2019s that kind of ridiculous stat that has Villa supporters dreaming of the top four despite the apparent implausibility. \n Opta\u2019s modelling gives them only a 1.8 per cent chance of finishing fifth or higher, but that might shift a fair bit should they beat  Newcastle United  at Villa Park in Saturday's early kick-off. \n Doing so would end Newcastle\u2019s five-match winning streak and put Villa six points behind  Eddie Howe\u2019 s side, albeit having played an extra match. \n If Villa are to squeeze into the UEFA Champions League, they need to go an unprecedented hot streak while also hoping a win this weekend triggers a downward spiral for Newcastle. \n Everton need goals in pivotal match \n The points-per-match records of those locked in the relegation battle suggests as little as 35 points could be enough to stay up this season, which means  Everton  need at least another eight. \n \n \n \n \n \n EVE \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 3 \n \n FUL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n When you consider that 10 of the 12 points  Sean Dyche  has won as Everton boss were at Goodison Park, where the Toffees only have four matches left - including Man City and Newcastle - suddenly  Fulham  on Saturday looks a pivotal moment in their season. \n It is certainly winnable. Fulham have lost each of their last four Premier League matches, the same number of defeats as in their previous 16, and have conceded 12 goals across their last five. \n Aleksandar Mitrovic \u2019s continued absence could help Everton bully their visitors, especially if Dyche moves back to a 4-5-1 after the failed experiment with a 4-4-2 at Old Trafford last weekend. \n However, it remains unclear quite where Everton\u2019s goals are going to come from. They have scored two goals in a match only twice since late October and their top scorer  Demarai Gray \u00a0has just four in the Premier League. \n There was at least more a threat against  Tottenham Hotspur  in the last home match, with the Toffees registering 15 shots as they fought back with 10 men to grab a late  1-1 draw . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Everton's shots in last home match v Spurs\n             \n \n This may not be a classic, but if Everton are to discover a new goalscoring avenue for the run-in, it is likely to be this weekend, in their only remaining Goodison Park fixture prior to the final day against a team outside the current top four. \n Can Saints halt Palace\u2019s dribbling frenzy? \n Crystal Palace \u2019s revival under  Roy Hodgson  appears to have been built on carefree attacking football channelled through his surprisingly creative central midfield, where  Eberechi Eze  and  Jeffrey Schlupp  are operating as No 8s behind a front three. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Against Leicester, they hit a joint club-record 31 shots at goal, and then against  Leeds United \u00a0they made 33 successful dribbles, the most by any Premier League team on record since 2003/04. \n \n \n \n \n \n SOU \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 2 \n \n CRY \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n But there is reason to believe this success will be short-lived. Leeds are notoriously aggressive in how they press, sprinting hard at players and consequently leaving themselves vulnerable to being dribbled past, while Leicester have been disordered for some time. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Palace dribbles in their last match against Leeds\n             \n \n In fact, tellingly Leeds and Leicester rank first and second in the Premier League for the number of take-ons against them. \n No wonder mazy dribblers Palace, who have attempted the second-most take-ons in the league, with 618, weaved through their first two matches under Hodgson. \n In stark contrast,  Southampton  have conceded the third fewest take-ons that lead to a shot (27), behind Arsenal and Man City, while also making the fifth-fewest errors leading to a shot (six) and topping the charts for total interceptions (327) despite being bottom of the league. \n The graphic below shows how difficult Tottenham Hotspur's players found it to dribble through Saints last month at St Mary's.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Spurs' dribbles v Southampton last month\n             \n \n In other words, Southampton have a more robust defensive shape than Leeds or Leicester, and are well set up to shackle Hodgson's team. \n",

His backheel in the build-up to  Alejandro Garnacho \u2019s offside goal was \u2013 almost \u2013 a headline-making moment on his debut. \n Man Utd fans are desperate to see Hojlund start Saturday\u2019s match against Brighton, whose own aggressive high line is likely to create more counter-attacking opportunities of the sort that could release Hojlund in behind. \n Brighton's 49 high turnovers and 13 shot-ending high turnovers are the most in the Premier League this season, while they also have recorded the league\u2019s lowest average for Passes Per Defensive Action (PPDA) with 8.7. \n Roberto De Zerbi \u2019s commitment to pushing high and taking the match to the opposition theoretically makes them vulnerable to the fast runners in United's attack. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Ten Hag may feel that his new striker, who only appeared off the bench for Denmark during the break, is still not ready to start, but even as a substitute Hojlund could have a dramatic impact on his home debut. \n He marked his home debut for Atalanta last season with two goals in a 2-1 win against RB Salzburg. Going back further, Hojlund scored within six minutes of his home debut for Sturm Graz, having also netted a brace on his full debut at WSG Tirol eight days earlier. \n Hojlund is a fast starter, and potentially the perfect striker to take on De Zerbi\u2019s team.

Could it be that Man City are a more ponderous side this season, and therefore more vulnerable to the low block? \n West Ham United  will provide us with our answer. Their 3-1 wins over Brighton and  Chelsea  were classic  David Moyes : 22 per cent and 24 per cent possession respectively, with every man behind the ball and goals scored via long balls played into the channels for  Michail Antonio . \n They refused to press Brighton at all and therefore stumped them, while Chelsea were similarly kept at arm\u2019s length before  James Ward-Prowse \u2019s set-piece delivery did the rest.

They are undefeated in their last 15 Premier League matches against West Ham since  losing 2-1 in September 2015 , and Moyes\u2019s similar approach in 2022/23 resulted in 2-0 and 3-0 wins for Man City. \n In one of those, the 3-0 victory at the Etihad, Man City were without De Bruyne.

They were without the Brazilian in that 1-0 defeat at Goodison Park last season, when Arsenal mustered only three shots on target, but they are in much better form now. \n More significantly, Jesus \u2013 who scored off the bench against Man Utd a fortnight ago - has scored eight goals in nine Premier League appearances against Everton at an average of a goal every 71 minutes, which is the best rate of any player to play more than 500 minutes against Everton. \n \n \n Too cold, Gabby \ud83e\udd76  pic.twitter.com/zdlHo0EkbX \n\u2014 Arsenal (@Arsenal)  September 4, 2023 \n \n The stage is set for Jesus to remind Arsenal of what they\u2019ve been missing. \n Howe badly needs a win \n A difficult beginning to 2023/24 largely explains  Newcastle United \u2019s tough start - they won four points from the corresponding fixtures last year, compared with three this time. \n \n \n \n \n \n NEW \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 0 \n \n BRE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Nevertheless pressure is slowly building on  Eddie Howe .

Brighton scored within 15 minutes at Molineux earlier this season and  cruised to a 4-1 win , belying predictions that Wolves could counter-attack menacingly as they had in an unlucky  1-0 defeat to Man Utd . \n There is a chance that the direct dribbling of  Matheus Cunha  and  Pedro Neto  will break Liverpool\u2019s high line, and a sense of vulnerability that still lingers over the Liverpool system. \n See:  Who's run fastest and furthest this season \n But that chance vanishes should Liverpool score early - Wolves have won only two of the last 37 Premier League matches in which they have conceded (D8 L27). \n The return of Liverpool\u2019s organised high press, which was immaculate against Villa before the international break, offers hope they will be alert for the lunchtime kick-off. They have attempted the second-most presses with 151 in the league after four matches, more than double their 69 at this stage last season. \n If Liverpool carry that energy forward, they should be able to race into an early lead and claim another three points. \n Fulham must seize chance to kickstart season \n We are only four matches into the new season but  Fulham \u2019s position is beginning to look a little precarious. \n \n \n \n \n \n FUL \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 0 \n \n LUT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n That opening-day  1-0 win at Everton  was a red herring and gives Fulham a somewhat false position in the table. Everton accrued an Expected Goals (xG) total of 2.7 and had nine shots on target to Fulham\u2019s nine, leading to  Bernd Leno  winning a club-record 91.7 per cent of the fans\u2019 vote for Fulham\u2019s Man of the Match. \n Since then, things have got progressively worse. Fulham have the highest figure for Expected Goals Against (xGA) in the division with 12.1, and their 10 goals conceded are the second-most behind  Burnley . Their xG of 3.9 is also the fourth-lowest in the league, with only the three promoted clubs performing worse. \n In fact, Fulham have won only two of their last eight home league matches and failed to keep a clean sheet in a single one of them, conceding 16 goals at a rate of two per match. \n Clearly  Marco Silva  needs a win \u2013 and based on  Luton Town \u2019s difficult start to their debut Premier League campaign, a home match against  Rob Edwards \u2019 side is an opportunity Fulham cannot afford to miss. \n",

        "text": "\n Following a thrilling weekend, delivering drama from top to bottom in the Premier League, Alex Keble looks at the key talking points and tactical lessons. \n Zinchenko absence ends title challenge \n As  Pervis Estupinan  scored  Brighton & Hove Albion \u2019s third goal in stoppage time, Emirates Stadium, already emptying rapidly, fell into a deathly silence. \n \n \n \n \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 3 \n \n BHA \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n In that heavy, loaded pause, we were left wondering how exactly things had changed so quickly; how it was that only six weeks ago, an electric atmosphere inside this ground made a first Premier League title for  Arsenal  in 19 years feel almost inevitable. \n Defeat by Brighton  on Sunday means  Manchester City  need only three points from their final three matches to secure their fifth title in six years. \n The last time they failed to collect as many points over a three-match period was April 2017, in  Pep Guardiola \u2019s first season in charge. \n Arsenal captain  Martin Odegaard  put it best when he said, \u201cIt feels like there is no hope now.\u201d \n Ultimately Arsenal\u2019s form over the second half of the campaign has fallen short of the level required to win the title. They won 50 points from the first 19 matches (2.63 points a match) and 31 from the 17 since (1.82 per match), the latter being exactly the same points ratio as across the whole of their 2021/22 season. \n Arguably, the main reason for the decline is a lack of squad depth, which simply highlights the extent to which Arsenal have overachieved to even be in the title race so late into the season. \n Arsenal hold a 100 per cent win record in the Premier League when fielding  Mikel Arteta \u2019s preferred first XI, but have generally had problems when  Gabriel Jesus ,  William Saliba , or  Oleksandr Zinchenko  have been absent. \n The entire structure of Arsenal\u2019s build-up play shifts when Zinchenko is out because  Kieran Tierney  is not the player to move into central midfield in the same way. \n Take a look at Tierney\u2019s touches against Brighton, compared with Zinchenko\u2019s in his most recent full 90 minutes  against Chelsea . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Kieran Tierney's touches in Sunday's loss to Brighton showed how he was more constrained to the left of Arsenal's play\n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Oleksandr Zinchenko's touches in the recent 3-1 win over Chelsea showed how he was able to move inside into central midfield in a way that Tierney did not\n             \n \n This fundamental shift in passing options takes away Arsenal\u2019s instinctive, muscle-memory decisions when playing out from the back, which was particularly problematic given Brighton\u2019s exceptional pressing. \n It left Arsenal with their lowest possession share of the season at 32 per cent and their lowest pass accuracy of 72 per cent. \n Saliba\u2019s injury has been no less significant. Arsenal have conceded 25 goals at home this season, the sixth most in the Premier League (more than  Nottingham Forest  and  Leicester City ), but things are far better when Arteta has his first-choice centre-back partnership. \n Arsenal conceded 25 goals in the 27 league matches in which Saliba has played (0.93 per match), but let in 17 goals in the nine matches he has missed - a rate of 1.89 or more than double. \n For Arsenal to ensure this season is the beginning of something and not the peak, they need to add strength in depth over the summer. \n Man City show off what Arsenal lack \n By contrast Man City\u2019s squad depth is unparalleled and there was no better example of the fundamental difference between the two title challengers than Sunday's matches. \n \n \n \n \n \n EVE \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 3 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n At Goodison, Man City  beat Everton 3-0  despite half of their outfield players having started at most 19 of their 35 league matches. \n Julian Alvarez  (11 matches),  Phil Foden  (19),  Riyad Mahrez  (19),  Kyle Walker  (19) and  Aymeric Laporte  (nine) would be star players in most teams, and it is a reflection of City\u2019s deep bench and superior resources, that the average number of Premier League starts made by the outfield players who faced Everton was 21.3. \n Guardiola decided to rotate heavily because of the Real Madrid matches either side of Sunday\u2019s fixture, yet the quality barely went down. \n Mahrez registered his 10th assist of the Premier League season, his most in a single City campaign despite his inconsistent selection, while Foden has 15 goal contributions and Alvarez has scored eight times. \n That ability to rotate is what has allowed Man City to compete on three fronts and accelerate towards the end of the season as an exhausted Arsenal decline, hence their 11 consecutive Premier League wins. \n Few matches have been as awkward as this one was, however, and before  Ilkay Gundogan \u2019s magnificent opener, there were hints that Everton might be able to nick something. In the first 30 minutes, Man City had one shot on goal.  Erling Haaland  touched the ball twice. \n Sean Dyche \u2019s cautious, compressed 4-5-1 formation was keeping City at bay and, without  Kevin De Bruyne  floating between the lines, the visitors were forced to shuffle the ball into less dangerous wide positions. But it only took one remarkable Gundogan flick to completely rewrite the narrative. \n In the end, Man City breezed through the match, showing the certainty and ruthlessness that Arsenal have been lacking in 2023. They will be deserving champions. \n Fernandes is back to his best \n It has not been the most eye-catching of seasons for  Bruno Fernandes , who despite  Manchester United \u2019s renewed clarity under  Erik ten Hag , has made headlines considerably less often than  Marcus Rashford  or  Casemiro . \n \n \n \n \n \n MUN \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 0 \n \n WOL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n That is partly because Fernandes was well below his best in the first half of the campaign, scoring twice and assisting none in his 13 Premier League matches prior to the FIFA World Cup. \n But with 12 goal contributions in 21 matches since then, Fernandes has returned to his very best form. \n His performance in the 2-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday was arguably his most complete of the season. \n Fernandes produced 14 shot-creating actions, his highest of the season to date, taking his tally for the campaign to 199, a full 25 more than second-placed De Bruyne. \n Yet even this doesn\u2019t quite capture his contribution. His assist for  Alejandro Garnacho \u2019s goal was excellent, but better still was his role in the opener. \n Fernandes, ghosting into a pocket of space, played a neat one-two around the corner before threading a through-ball into the path of  Antony , who squared for  Anthony Martial  to score a tap-in. \n It was his sixth pre-assist of the season and symptomatic of his mastery of the \"pass before the pass\". \n Fernandes tops the Premier League charts for secondary chances created, with 47. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Bruno Fernandes (No 8) played a neat one-two with Jadon Sancho (25) before playing in Antony, who squared for Anthony Martial to score\n             \n \n It was a superb, game-changing moment from Fernandes and one that highlighted why his best position remains as United\u2019s No 10. \n He took 62 touches of the ball against Wolves, almost half as many as when he was moved into a deeper midfield position ( 119 touches v Everton ,  111 v Brentford ), but counterintuitively this smaller role gives him greater influence. \n Fernandes is at his best when sneaking around, popping up on the blind side of an opposition midfield. \n Villa v Spurs sums up both clubs\u2019 seasons \n A potential UEFA Europa League Conference playoff was deservedly won by  Aston Villa , who moved level on points with  Tottenham Hotspur  as they close in on European football for the first time since 2011. \n \n \n \n \n \n AVL \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 1 \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Villa\u2019s difficult run-in \u2013  Liverpool away , then  Brighton at home  \u2013 means Spurs are still in the driving seat, yet  Ryan Mason \u2019s side have won just one of their last six. \n Their decline is as spectacular as Villa\u2019s rise and the match at Villa Park seemed to capture everything about where these two clubs are at. \n The hosts were fluent and assured, every player knowing exactly what was required of them. The visitors were more the opposite. \n The difference between the two sides\u2019 tactical formation graphs \u2013 one neatly spaced horizontally and vertically, the other clumped together \u2013 tells the story. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                How Villa lined up their victory over Spurs\n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Spurs' shape in their defeat to Aston Villa\n             \n \n For Villa, it was a sixth successive home win, their longest run since February 1993, when Graham Taylor\u2019s side finished runners-up to Man Utd. \n Unai Emery  is now averaging 1.96 points per match (ppm) as Villa head coach, the third-best rate of anyone who has taken charge of 10 or more fixtures this season, behind Guardiola (2.41ppm) and Arteta (2.31ppm). \n Spurs, meanwhile, are now winless in seven away matches and across their last five in the Premier League, have conceded seven goals in the opening 10 minutes. \n But if there is one moment that really encapsulated Spurs\u2019 season, it was the sight of  Harry Kane  scoring a goal despite the poor performances of those around him. \n Kane has scored in 24 Premier League matches this season, the joint-most of any player in a 38-match season, along with  Mohamed Salah  in 2017/18. \n Haaland\u2019s goalscoring feats have taken attention from Kane\u2019s superb 27-goal haul, an achievement made all the more spectacular in the context of Spurs' difficult year and often underwhelming defensive football. \n His 0.8 goals per 90 is his joint-best ever in a single season, plus Kane has already played a career-high 55 key passes. \n He is seemingly impervious to the performances of his team-mates, a lone star, bested on Saturday by a Villa team all about the collective. \n Southampton\u2019s relegation confirmed \n The headline news from St Mary's Stadium was  Southampton \u2019s relegation to the Championship, ending an 11-year stay in the top flight. It was a fall that had felt inevitable for some time. \n Ultimately the decision to replace  Ralph Hasenhuttl  with  Nathan Jones  and the woes of his eight matches in charge cost Southampton their Premier League status. \n Saints won 12 points from 14 matches under Hasenhuttl this season, a rate of 0.86 per match which, had he stayed and that record held, would put them on 31 today \u2013 level with  Leeds United  and just a point behind Everton in 17th. \n But it would be too simplistic to suggest Southampton should have kept Hasenhuttl, and nobody could have predicted the club would decline so sharply with each manager change. \n Across all competitions,  Ruben Selles 's win percentage of 13.3 per cent was lower than Jones' 35.7 per cent, although the interim manager has won nine points from 14 in the Premier League, compared with Jones\u2019s three from eight. \n How Saints' managers fared in 2022/23 PL \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n Hasenhuttl \n Jones \n Selles \n \n \n \n \n Matches \n 14 \n 8 \n 14 \n \n \n Points \n 12 (3W, 3D, 8L) \n 3 (1W, 0D, 7L) \n 9 (2W, 3D, 9L) \n \n \n \n Managerial uncertainty is the story of their relegation, but ultimately Southampton just weren\u2019t good enough no matter who was in the dugout. \n They have lost 24 league matches in 2022/23, more than in any previous season in their 132-year history, losing seven or more times under three different managers. \n",

But this is no fire-fighter appointment. \n \n \n \n \n \n WOL \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 0 \n \n CHE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n History suggests Lampard will look to unshackle his players from the shrinking, sideways possession that dragged the  Graham Potter  era into its stodgy final stage.\u00a0 \n During his only full season in charge at Stamford Bridge in 2019/20, Lampard\u2019s side were an expansive and expressive team defined by high-energy attacking football that verged on the care-free \u2013 for better and for worse. \n Despite finishing fourth in the table, Chelsea ranked second, behind Man City and above 99-point Liverpool, on a host of metrics including shots (618), shot-creating actions (1,121), and key passes (459), reflecting the manic attacking energy that saw Lampard\u2019s side pour forward.\u00a0 \n But by spreading out and attacking in high numbers, Chelsea were regularly vulnerable on the counter-attack, lacking the structural assurance that we tend to see from a patient, but rigid, overall shape like Potter\u2019s. \n That\u2019s why Chelsea conceded the ninth-most goals (54), and although openness to opposition attacks can be difficult to capture in statistics, there is one telling sign they were often too fanned out to plug the gaps: Chelsea made a combined 1,097 tackles and interceptions, the fifth most in the division behind  Crystal Palace ,  West Ham United ,  Southampton \u00a0and  Leicester City .\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                All 30 tackles for Chelsea v Wolves under Lampard in a 2-0 win during the 2019/20 season\n             \n \n For a team who averaged 60.4 per cent possession, that is a huge number of defensive interventions of the kind that, more often than not, reflect recoveries from thorny situations. \n Most assured defending happens without actually needing to challenge for the ball.\u00a0\u00a0 \n This is not to say that Lampard won\u2019t succeed during his nine matches as caretaker manager. \n Arguably what Chelsea need most, after months of fine-tuned positional coaching under Potter, is someone who will turn the dial a little, allowing greater imagination to rebuild confidence and release the talent in the Chelsea forward line.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Wolves, more ponderous in possession under  Julen Lopetegui , might be particularly vulnerable to fast and improvisational attacking football, as evidenced by the way  Leeds United  cut through them to score four times last weekend despite  Wolverhampton Wanderers  holding 65.9 per cent possession.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Southampton's pedigree v \u2018Big Six\u2019 \n On first look, rock-bottom Southampton, without a win in four, look set to be blown away by a Man City side that has won their last seven matches in all competitions and were magnificent in the  4-1 destruction of Liverpool  last weekend. \n \n \n \n \n \n SOU \n \n \n \n \n 1 -

It goes some way to explaining why Fulham have collected 32 points from 21 matches in which Mitrovic has started (1.5 points per match) and seven points from the seven in which he has not (1.0ppm).\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Fulham crosses in 3-0 win v Crystal Palace (A)\n             \n \n One of those encounters without Mitrovic was a  3-1 defeat at West Ham  back in October, a match defined by the aerial dominance of the hosts. \n Only Man City, Arsenal and  Brighton & Hove Albion  allow fewer completed crosses into their penalty area than West Ham\u2019s 1.5 per match, and  Kurt Zouma  tops the Premier League charts for percentage of aerial duels won (84.5 per cent) among players who have featured in 10 or more matches.\u00a0 \n In other words, without Mitrovic, Fulham stand little chance of beating West Ham in the air, handing Moyes the initiative.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Cooper faces Villa at wrong time \u00a0 \n An eight-match winless run that leaves Nottingham Forest outside the bottom three on goal difference alone has, according to reports, put Steve Cooper under pressure, and while a statement from club owner Evangelos Marinakis denied he was about to change manager, it also acknowledged that \u201cresults and performances must improve immediately\u201d.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n AVL \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 0 \n \n NFO \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n This is hardly the ideal time to be playing  Aston Villa , whose five wins and one draw from their last six matches makes them the division\u2019s second-most in-form team behind Man City. \n On Saturday they aim to win their third consecutive league match at Villa Park for the first time in the same season since October 2007. There are plenty of reasons to assume they will do it, especially considering the difference in confidence between the two teams.\u00a0 \n Villa have scored a league-high nine goals in the opening 15 minutes of home fixtures this season, highlighting a self-belief under  Unai Emery  that will surely only grow as they move towards the European places. \n They could finish the weekend in sixth and within three points of Spurs in fifth, at which point their dream of entering the UEFA Europa League group stage for the first time since 2008/09 would move into view.\u00a0\u00a0 \n To make matters even more ominous for Forest fans, their team have only won a single point (v Brighton) in away matches against top-half opponents this season.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Dyche can stifle\u00a0 goal-shy Man Utd \n Largely for the reasons  noted earlier this week  regarding their midfield configuration in  Casemiro \u2019s absence, Man Utd have been struggling to build through the lines and create big chances: across their last four Premier League matches, they have scored only once, amassing a combined Expected Goals (xG) of just 3.2. \n \n \n \n \n \n MUN \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 0 \n \n EVE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n The problem is exacerbated by the use of  Wout Weghorst  in an advanced position, with the on-loan striker yet to muster a goal in nine appearances.\u00a0 \n Sean Dyche  is renowned for his stubborn defences, and although Everton have been more porous than he would like away from home \u2013 conceding two or more in each of their last five such matches in the league \u2013 the manager's influence is beginning to show. \n Everton are undefeated in four matches. They will sit back a little and trust they can slow the game down, just as Southampton did in a  0-0 draw  at Old Trafford in March.\u00a0 \n Much rests on  Marcus Rashford , whose winner in the  1-0 victory over Brentford  on Wednesday means he has now scored more goals (11) than anyone in the Premier League since the FIFA World Cup 2022, and means he is responsible for seven of the last nine goals United have scored in the competition, stretching all the way back to mid-January. \n For Dyche and Everton, the mission is clear: stop Rashford and a clean sheet is on the cards.\u00a0 \n",

Here was the clearest example yet of why  Trent Alexander-Arnold \u2019s new role in central midfield can recharge the Klopp era \u2013 but also why it remains, for now, a flawed idea. \n Starting with the positives, it was Alexander-Arnold\u2019s positioning alongside  Fabinho  that shielded against Spurs counter-attacks while allowing midfielders  Harvey Elliott  and  Curtis Jones  to spread high and wide. This provided Liverpool with an interesting shape that was difficult to mark, a 2-2-6 that saw a host of attackers dovetailing across the Spurs defensive line. \n Note how tough it is for Spurs' midfield to track Liverpool\u2019s narrow attackers here, in the build-up to the penalty concession and Liverpool\u2019s third goal. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Spurs' midfield struggle to track Liverpool\u2019s narrow attackers\n             \n \n For the first goal, Jones was able to pop up \u2013 untracked and unmarked - on the back post because of how Fabinho and Alexander-Arnold released him to lurk higher up the pitch. The second goal, built through Elliott high on the right side, was a move that began with Alexander-Arnold winning a challenge with  Son Heung-min  to shut down the threat of a counter-attack. \n But perhaps unsurprisingly a 2-2-6 is vulnerable to counter-attacks if, or rather when, that first defensive screen is broken past. Spurs got back into the match via a long ball down Liverpool\u2019s right \u2013 where Alexander-Arnold was nowhere to be seen. \n The nominal right-back has now assisted a goal in each of his last five Premier League appearances, which is reason enough to keep him in this new role. But tweaks are undoubtedly required, because the sudden crumbling of Liverpool\u2019s back four was intimately related to the unusual attacking positions taken up by Klopp\u2019s team. \n Contrasting Aprils for AFC Bournemouth and Leeds \n At the beginning of April just one point separated  AFC Bournemouth  and  Leeds United , both of whom looked equally likely to finish in the bottom three. By the end of the month the Cherries had moved eight points clear of them as  Gary O\u2019Neil \u2019s side all-but sealed safety with a 4-1 win. \n \n \n \n \n \n BOU \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 1 \n \n LEE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n AFC Bournemouth claimed 15 points in April, their most in any month this season, and their five wins were only one fewer than they managed between August and March. Leeds lost five times in April, their most defeats in a single month since 2015 and a joint-record in the Premier League. They also conceded 23 goals, a Premier League record in a single month. \n Ordinarily records across an arbitrary intra-season time period aren\u2019t meaningful, but April is the cruellest month in the competition. More often than not it is the defining period, during which time a congested Premier League table separates and a clearer narrative emerges. \n That\u2019s precisely what\u2019s happened this year. Leeds now have a 60.1 per cent chance of going down, according to Opta, while AFC Bournemouth have surely guaranteed their place in the top flight. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mixed fortunes of Tomas Soucek \n West Ham United  have really missed  Tomas Soucek \u2019s goal contributions. He racked up 11 in his first Premier League season, six in his second, and just two in 2022/23 \u2013 until Saturday.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n CRY \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 3 \n \n WHU \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Soucek's opener at  Crystal Palace  was his 20th Premier League goal but his first in 27 matches, and it was followed by two assists, both flick-ons from corners. \n But West Ham lost the match because of a familiar difficulty controlling central midfield - and Soucek is at least partly to blame for the notable downturn in the club\u2019s performances this season. \n On Saturday, his miscontrol near the box allowed  Jeffrey Schlupp  to score Palace\u2019s third, before Soucek lost  Eberechi Eze  when a simple one-two led to a penalty concession: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n It was the best and worst of Soucek; penalty-box poaching at one end but passive resistance at the other. It\u2019s been the theme of his season, although perhaps it is the West Ham system, rather than the players within it, that is to blame. \n David Moyes \u2019 4-4-1-1, with  Lucas Paqueta  pushing higher than Soucek and  Declan Rice , is regularly leaving West Ham light in the middle. It was a recurring pattern at Selhurst Park with Eze or Schlupp finding space on the outside of Rice and Soucek. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Palace find space as West Ham's midfield push up\n             \n \n The stats bear this out. West Ham have allowed 44.9 progressive passes per match this season, up from 40.4 in 2021/22, while their opponents\u2019 progressive carries are up from 20.9 to 22.2 per match. Most tellingly, they have allowed 2.09 through-balls per match \u2013 the second-most in the division \u2013 after ranking 12th, with 1.32 per match in 2021/22. \n These aren\u2019t drastic numbers, but it\u2019s enough to leave West Ham more open between the lines and Soucek struggling to contribute as much defensively as he once did. \n Man City lose some composure without De Bruyne \n Few people thought  Fulham  would come this close to taking points from  Manchester City . Ultimately the visitors deserved their win, restricting Fulham to 0.2 xG from four shots on goal, but it\u2019s fair to say didn\u2019t find the fluency we have been used to in recent weeks \u2013 and telling that it took an incredible strike from  Julian Alvarez  to win the three points. \n \n \n \n \n \n FUL \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 2 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Pep Guardiola  had a novel explanation for it. \u201cOn the transitions the grass was so, so long, even for them,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not complaining, everyone at home can decide what they want, but when  Erling  [ Haaland ] drives with the ball some passes always stopped the rhythm, and that\u2019s why our transitions today were not as effective.\u201d \n Whether or not that is true, it should also be noted that  Kevin De Bruyne \u2019s absence played a part. Without the Belgian\u2019s ability to seek out space between the lines and make himself available for a forward pass, City were left playing more sideways than usual. \n Their average number of progressive passes per match this season is 55.7, but against Fulham they hit only 44. They also made 11 switches of play, their joint most of the season (an indicator of needing to move horizontal to find space, rather than vertical) and recorded 11 progressive carries, their second-lowest tally of the season. \n The loss of De Bruyne was clearly a factor in this. Alvarez is a fantastic player but a very different profile, hence why he could not get near De Bruyne\u2019s usual numbers on Sunday. \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n De Bruyne/90 22/23 ave. \n Alvarez v Fulham \n \n \n \n \n Touches \n 67.8 \n 38 \n \n \n Passes received \n 52.5 \n 24 \n \n \n Progressive passes \n 9 \n 2 \n \n \n \n After the match Guardiola said he did not know when De Bruyne would be back, and on the evidence at Craven Cottage an extended absence could give  Arsenal  supporters some hope. \n Ten Hag goes direct to outwit Emery \n There was one simple reason why  Manchester United  stretched their home run to 26 without defeat and ended  Aston Villa \u2019s unbeaten 10-match run in the process. \n \n \n \n \n \n MUN \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 0 \n \n AVL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Ordinarily it is  Unai Emery  whose tactical tinkering catches opposition managers by surprise, but on Sunday it was  Erik ten Hag  who switched things up by going far more direct than usual. \n \u201cIt was definitely one of our ideas for this game, to play the ball in behind,\u201d Ten Hag said. \u201cThe timing was not always perfect but, with our speed, we do it in the right way, we created chances from it and have to score more.\u201d \n The tactic was constant, as  Jadon Sancho ,  Marcus Rashford , and even  Bruno Fernandes  sought to make runs in behind at every opportunity, with the United midfielders invariably hitting long balls over the top of Villa's defence. \n In this classic example, note how alert United are to both beginning the runs and seeking the early pass, suggesting Ten Hag had worked hard in the week to prepare them for Villa\u2019s high line. Fernandes has three runners to hit. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Bruno Fernandes has multiple forward passing options\n             \n \n Villa largely did well to play United offside - their seven offsides were a season-high - but the winner, via a simple header from  Casemiro  playing Rashford through on goal, was the result of United\u2019s persistent pressure. \n It was also a consequence of  Tyrell Malacia \u2019s role moving into central midfield, which freed  Marcel Sabitzer  to join the front three in pushing against Villa\u2019s high line - until they finally broke it. \n Fernandes' winner v Villa \n \n \n The desire from  @B_Fernandes8  to follow up on the back post \ud83d\udc4c #MUFC  ||  #MUNAVL \n\u2014 Manchester United (@ManUtd)  April 30, 2023 \n \n Enciso and Undav the latest Brighton discoveries \n Last weekend it was  Facundo Buonanotte  who emerged out of nowhere, the 18-year-old Argentinian scoring on his first start for  Brighton & Hove Albion  following his January move from Rosario Central. \n \n \n \n \n \n BHA \n \n \n \n \n 6 - 0 \n \n WOL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n In the 6-0 win over  Wolverhampton Wanderers  on Saturday another two products of the club's remarkable scouting department made their names. \n Aged 19 years and 96 days,  Julio Enciso  became the youngest South American to assist two goals in a Premier League match, while  Deniz Undav , a late bloomer who arrived at Brighton in the summer, scored his first goals for them. \n Both players were making only their third starts of 2022/23, highlighting  Roberto De Zerbi \u2019s incredible squad depth.

        "text": "\n With plenty more drama guaranteed at both ends of the table in Matchweek 34, Alex Keble looks at the key talking points. \n Alexander-Arnold crucial to stopping Kane \n The UEFA Champions League spots look a step too far for  Liverpool  and  Tottenham Hotspur  but, separated by a single point and with  Aston Villa  showing no signs of slowing down, it\u2019s possible only one of them will be in Europe next season. \n \n \n \n \n \n LIV \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 3 \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Sunday's showdown promises to be an entertaining encounter. \n Spurs\u2019 2-2 draw with Manchester United  saw  Ryan Mason  reintroduce a counter-attacking approach as  Richarlison ,  Son Heung-min \u00a0and  Harry Kane  bunched together to hammer at the door, which should open things up for the sort of end-to-end contest that Liverpool can rarely resist taking part in. \n Better still for neutrals, Liverpool have conceded four goals in their last two home matches while Spurs have conceded 31 on the road across the season, already their most in a single campaign since 2008/09. Leaky defences plus quick forwards usually means goals. \n But  Jurgen Klopp  is working hard to halt the chaos, and the visit of Spurs presents the perfect test for his latest tweak:  Trent Alexander-Arnold  moving into central midfield. \n Over the last four matches Alexander-Arnold, though nominally starting as a right-back, has moved alongside  Fabinho  to help screen against opposition counters and create chances in that fertile No 10 space. \n After the  6-1 victory over Leeds United  on 17 April, Klopp praised Alexander-Arnold\u2019s passing and his defensive cover from central midfield: \u201cHe can do both, but we do need to be protected better because we have been conceding too many counter-attacks.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Alexander-Arnold was superb against Leeds and played a huge part in the Reds' emphatic success\n             \n \n Tellingly, Alexander-Arnold had 151 touches against  Leeds , his most in a match this season, and 121 against  West Ham United , his fourth-highest total, while in the same two encounters, Liverpool recorded their two highest totals of the campaign for tackles in the middle third with 12 against West Ham and 10 versus Leeds. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Liverpool were far more combative against the Hammers as the dots show how many tackles they won\n             \n \n Everyone knows how lethal Kane can be in the zone of the pitch now occupied by both Fabinho and Alexander-Arnold. Kane was superb against  Man Utd  who, even with  Casemiro  at the base of midfield, could not get close to him in the second half. \n Here, then, is a pivotal moment for Klopp and Alexander-Arnold. If he wins his head-to-head with Kane, Liverpool\u2019s new formation might become a permanent feature. \n Villa's narrow midfield posing problems \n Aston Villa  are third in the Premier League table since  Unai Emery  took charge in October, winning 42 points from 21 encounters - and just five fewer than  Arsenal  having played one less match. Had this sequence started in August we would be talking about Villa as outsiders for the title as late as mid-February. \n There\u2019s a good reason to think their 10-match unbeaten run will be extended at Old Trafford on Sunday. Granted, United are unbeaten in 14 at home in the Premier League and Villa, who  won 3-1 in the reverse fixture , haven\u2019t done the league double over United since 1955, but Emery keeps finding the right tactical method to outwit his opponent. \n \n \n \n \n \n MUN \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 0 \n \n AVL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n And in this case, he\u2019s done it before. \n Emery\u2019s first contest in charge was that 3-1 victory in which Villa deployed a 4-4-2 formation with the wide men,  Jacob Ramsey  and  Emiliano Buendia , playing more like attacking midfielders, ghosting in off the flanks to arrive in the middle and confuse the Man Utd midfield. \n The first and third Villa goals were the result of that tactic. In the first image, note how  Christian Eriksen  has lost Ramsey just before he plays in  Leon Bailey  to give Villa the lead: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Ramsey (top circle) and Buendia (bottom circle) were a big threat in that pocket of space between Man Utd's midfield and defence\n             \n \n This time Buendia is in a surprise position, and after he feeds  Ollie Watkins  to counter-attack it is eventually the other winger, Ramsey, who pops up to finish the move from the centre of the penalty area: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Man Utd must be more aware of Buendia (top circle) and Ramsey (bottom circle) or they could face a similar result at Old Trafford this Sunday\n             \n \n Villa have changed a little since then, moving to a 4-2-3-1 with Buendia stationed in the middle, but the tactical identity is the same. Meanwhile, United have arguably become even more vulnerable to Emery\u2019s strategy. \n As previously mentioned, Kane ran the midfield on Thursday. Eriksen and Casemiro struggled with the sudden changes of tempo in the contest, which forms part of an emerging pattern of United falling flat in second halves: across the last four matches in which United did not win, eight of the nine goals conceded came in the second 45. \n By contrast, Villa have scored a goal in the final 10 minutes in four of their last five matches. They will keep pushing right to the end \u2013 and with a plan that has borne fruit against  Erik Ten Hag \u2019s side once already this season. \n \n \n \n The race for Europe \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Position \n Pos \n \n Club \n \n Played \n Pl \n \n GD \n \n Points \n Pts \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Manchester United \n MUN \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +15\n\n \n 75 \n \n \n \n 4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Newcastle United \n NEW \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +35\n\n \n 71 \n \n \n \n 5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Liverpool \n LIV \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +28\n\n \n 67 \n \n \n \n 6 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Brighton & Hove Albion \n BHA \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +19\n\n \n 62 \n \n \n \n 7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Aston Villa \n AVL \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +5\n\n \n 61 \n \n \n \n 8 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Tottenham Hotspur \n TOT \n \n \n 38 \n \n        +7\n\n \n 60 \n \n \n \n \n \n View More \n \n Man City can stretch their legs at the top \n Wednesday\u2019s annihilation of Arsenal  was the moment Manchester City became clear favourites to win their fifth title in six years, but Sunday is their first opportunity to actually move into top spot. They haven\u2019t been there since 17 February, and only briefly, whereas this time they have the opportunity to sit and stay at the summit. \n Pep Guardiola \u2019s side will undoubtedly stay focused and vigilant for their run-in, but from the outside looking in their visit to Craven Cottage might feel like a lap of honour: a chance to really stretch their legs and show everyone why they are the best team in the country. \n \n \n \n \n \n FUL \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 2 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Fulham  have lost five of their last seven Premier League contests and were torn apart in a  3-0 defeat to Arsenal in March , the last time one of the current top four visited them. Man City have won seven in a row in the league. It would be one of the upsets of the season if the hosts were to take anything here. \n Instead, Man City will look to run riot and we may even get to see  Erling Haaland  break another record. He is now just one behind the Premier League record of 34 goals in a single season, set by  Andrew Cole  in 1993/94 and  Alan Shearer  in 1994/95, and after he quite literally let his hair down to score against Arsenal on Wednesday, Haaland will be at his swaggering best. \n If there is any hope for Fulham then it rests with  Joao Palhinha  \u2013 who was conspicuously absent for the Arsenal defeat. His 119 tackles this season are 28 more than anyone else but on Sunday his direct opponent is  Kevin De Bruyne , a man with seven goal involvements in his last four outings. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Palhinha showed why he is so important to Fulham, making six tackles in the 2-1 win against Leeds\n             \n \n As Arsenal found out - pressing high up only to see Man City go long - there are just too many different ways Guardiola\u2019s team can hurt you. Fulham will, most likely, be the unlucky foils for Man City\u2019s victory parade. \n Forest must end away hoodoo \n It\u2019s rare that a team can gain confidence from a defeat, but the manner of  Nottingham Forest \u2019s  3-2 loss at Liverpool  gave supporters hope that there is still a chance, and sure enough four days later a  3-1 win against Brighton & Hove Albion  has put them back in the race for Premier League safety. \n What those two matches had in common wasn\u2019t just the deployment of  Steve Cooper \u2019s new 3-4-2-1 formation, but a total disinterest in possession: Forest held 20 per cent at Liverpool and 26 per cent at home to  Roberto De Zerbi \u2019s side. \n Their tactical methods have been simplified even further. Forest now deploy a narrow box-shaped midfield to try to stop passes entering their final third; a back five to swarm the penalty area and block the goal; and a quick front three capable of breaking at speed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Forest's new formation worked to excellent effect against the Seagulls\n             \n \n It\u2019s a good platform, but frankly Forest will not stay up unless they improve their away record. They have produced the fewest points and fewest goals scored on the road this season, with six and seven in each respective department and have lost each of their last six away matches \u2013 conceding two or more goals in each. \n Forest\u2019s last two home encounters are against  Southampton  and Arsenal and even winning both of those would only give them 36 points, which may not be enough to finish 17th. \n Consequently they have to find a way to scrape points on their travels and a trip to  Brentford  could be an ideal place to start.  Thomas Frank \u2019s side  beat Chelsea 2-0  in midweek with just 27 per cent possession and, like Forest, they are yet to win a contest this season while holding the majority of the ball. \n \n \n \n \n \n BRE \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 1 \n \n NFO \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Something\u2019s got to give. Cooper will certainly hope his team\u2019s extra motivation will be enough because, should they record back-to-back wins for the first time since January just before hosting Southampton, all of a sudden Forest would have all the momentum. \n Leicester versus Everton a must-win \n Based on current points-per-match averages, at least 35 points will be required for safety, which means both  Everton  and  Leicester City  need a minimum of two victories. A look at their respective fixture lists tells us one of those wins probably needs to come in this contest: a six-pointer if ever there was one. \n \n \n \n \n \n LEI \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 2 \n \n EVE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Leicester's revival under  Dean Smith  is beginning to take shape. Four points from two matches is a decent start, and with some sharper attacking football returning in the form of the rejuvenated  James Maddison  and  Jamie Vardy , Leicester fans are feeling optimistic. \n Still, they are running out of time and this Monday\u2019s encounter with Everton is a must-win. The Foxes have Liverpool and West Ham in their final two home matches after this one, and their away fixtures against Fulham and  Newcastle United  are no easier. \n As for Everton, they are without an away win under  Sean Dyche  but face Man City next at Goodison Park before welcoming  AFC Bournemouth  on the final day. In order to still be in with a chance on the final weekend, Everton will have to collect three or four points on their travels. \n In other words, they cannot afford less than a win \u2013 and neither can Leicester. By the final whistle, we might just discover which of the Premier League stalwarts, both considered far too good to go down back in August, are on their way to the Championship. \n \n \n \n The relegation battle \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Position \n Pos \n \n Club \n \n Played \n Pl \n \n GD \n \n Points \n Pts \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Bournemouth \n BOU \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -34\n\n \n 39 \n \n \n \n 16 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Nottingham Forest \n NFO \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -30\n\n \n 38 \n \n \n \n 17 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Everton \n EVE \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -23\n\n \n 36 \n \n \n \n 18 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Leicester City \n LEI \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -17\n\n \n 34 \n \n \n \n 19 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Leeds United \n LEE \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -30\n\n \n 31 \n \n \n \n 20 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Southampton \n SOU \n \n \n 38 \n \n        -37\n\n \n 25 \n \n \n \n \n \n View More \n \n \n",

        "text": "\n Following a thrilling weekend delivering drama from top to bottom in the Premier League, Alex Keble looks at the key talking points and tactical lessons. \n Arteta fails to stem the tide \n A remarkable match at Anfield saw  Arsenal  stroll into the sort of comfortable two-goal lead that looked set to rise to five or six, only for  Liverpool  to roar back to swarm the visitors once  Mohamed Salah  had clawed one back. \u00a0 \n It was a bizarre and enthralling contest defined to an unusual extent by momentum shifts - suggesting emotionality led the action - and yet ultimately Liverpool\u2019s comeback was the consequence of  Jurgen Klopp \u2019s and  Mikel Arteta \u2019s in-game changes.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n LIV \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 2 \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Arsenal\u2019s dominant first 40 minutes was the result of them being afforded the opportunity to build their attacks with ease and, pressing high, disrupting Liverpool\u2019s rhythm. \u00a0 \n Klopp\u2019s decision to play  Trent Alexander-Arnold  in a central midfield position changed the choreography of Liverpool\u2019s possession, seemingly making them more susceptible to Arsenal\u2019s aggressive pressing, while  Curtis Jones  regularly pressed too high - stepping out of position to open up passing lanes for Arteta\u2019s side, including in the run-up to the first goal (see below) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Jones (circled in yellow) was the wrong side of Fabinho (circled in red) and was unable to block the pass to Saka in the build-up to the opener\n             \n \n But the crowd roared into life following an altercation between  Granit Xhaka  and Alexander-Arnold, and from this point on, Klopp helped his team wrestle control.\u00a0 \n As Liverpool pinned Arsenal back in the second half, Klopp brought on  Thiago Alcantara  for Jones to help maintain their territorial dominance. It worked. Thiago's 34 touches of the ball were more than anyone else during his 30 minutes on the field and he finished with the joint-highest pass accuracy (88.5 per cent).\u00a0\u00a0 \n By contrast, Arteta made no changes until the 80th\u00a0minute, when he withdrew  Gabriel Jesus , whose excellent hold-up play had been vital in relieving pressure every now and then.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Ultimately, the Arsenal manager was unable to stop his players from being pulled into the chaos; from attempting to counter-attack too quickly when they should have sought to slow the match down and regain some control. \u00a0 \n Tellingly, in the first 70 minutes, 61 per cent of Arsenal\u2019s passes were forward, whereas in the final 20 minutes, 80 per cent were forward. \n It meant Liverpool ended the match with an Expected Goals (xG) rating of 4.43, higher than the 4.08 in their  9-0 win over AFC Bournemouth  and in the  7-0 victory against Man Utd  (3.79).\u00a0 \n Lampard unable to lift Chelsea \n \u201cIt's a big task managing  Chelsea ,\u201d  Frank Lampard  said after his side\u2019s 1-0 defeat at  Wolves . \u201cI didn't expect to solve everything in one day.\u201d\u00a0 \n That is a fair reminder that Lampard cannot be expected to perform miracles with so little time on the training field since his appointment, and indeed the greatest challenging facing the Chelsea interim manager is getting his ideas across when the matches come thick and fast.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n WOL \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 0 \n \n CHE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Nevertheless, Lampard will have hoped for a more urgent reaction from his players ahead of the UEFA Champions League tie against Real Madrid. \n \u201cYou have to have more aggression in your game, more speed and more competitive duels which go your way,\u201d he added. \u00a0 \u201cIt's not stinging criticism, I know there's a lot of talent there.\u201d\u00a0 \n Clearly they need to improve their finishing, too. Chelsea have gone three Premier League matches without scoring, and on Saturday they hit the target with only one of their 13 shots. \n This is the most they have ever had in an away match since 2003/04 while managing only one or fewer shots on target.\u00a0\u00a0 \n But as Lampard alluded to, the problem goes deeper than that. \u00a0 Chelsea used a 4-3-3 formation for the first time since a  0-0 draw with Fulham  in February as Lampard reinstated the system he most often used during his last stint at the club, but it failed to produce a more creative or attacking display. \u00a0 \n Chelsea\u2019s xG of 1.1 was their lowest across the last seven matches in all competitions.\u00a0 \n Although defensively solid overall (Wolves only mustered a 0.6 xG), Chelsea were occasionally vulnerable down the flanks whenever the hosts managed to get behind  Raheem Sterling  and  Joao Felix . The Chelsea wingers\u2019 high starting positions often left too much space for their counterparts, including in the build-up to the winning goal.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                In the build-up to Nunes\u2019s goal, Podence (red circle) and Nunes (yellow circle) were free because Sterling (green circle) and Joao Felix (not in picture) did not track back\n             \n \n Fernandes thriving in quarterback role \u00a0 \n Erik ten Hag  has found an intriguing solution to playing without  Casemiro  and  Christian Eriksen  and, by deploying  Bruno Fernandes  in a new quarterback role, gave  Manchester United  the tactical advantage against  Everton .\u00a0 \n In what was clearly a prepared tactic, Fernandes consistently picked up the ball deep in his own half before pinging long passes over the top of the Everton full-backs, finding the runs of  Antony  and  Marcus Rashford  with regularity. \n \n \n \n \n \n MUN \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 0 \n \n EVE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n It led to United hitting a season-high 11 shots on target, and with more accurate finishing they would have put this contest to bed much earlier. \n United failed to convert seven big chances (six in the first half), their joint-highest in a Premier League match.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Fernandes' long passes v Everton (H)\n             \n \n Sean Dyche \u2019s team got to grips with the strategy in the second half after Dyche substituted  Ben Godfrey , who struggled with the ball sailing over him, and moved from an initial 4-4-2 to a 4-5-1 formation. \n Now with an extra player in  Alex Iwobi  in central midfield, Everton had a spare man to rush out to meet Fernandes and stop those longer passes. \n Coupled with a deeper defensive line, it ironed out the problems, hence why United outshot Everton 21-5 in the first half, only for Everton to outshoot United 6-3 in the second.\u00a0 \n But with 20 minutes remaining, a defensive error gave Man Utd the comfort of a second goal and the contest was over, perhaps leaving Dyche ruing his decision not to start with the same 4-5-1 used in all of his previous matches as Everton manager.\u00a0 \n Relentless Man City primed for run-in \n Manchester City \u2019s performance at  Southampton  was an ominous watch for Arsenal supporters. \u00a0 \n There is a distinct sense that  Pep Guardiola \u2019s side have moved through the gears, not only preparing for a relentless and machine-like final nine matches, but relishing the chance to do it. \n See:  Guardiola: I'm the happiest man when fighting for a title \n \u201cSeptember, October, November I enjoy less,\u201d Guardiola said after the match. \u201cWhen we arrive in the last stages, fighting for the title, I\u2019m the happiest man in the world. I love to be here.\u201d\u00a0 \n And why wouldn\u2019t he? City have won eight in a row in all competitions, scoring 21 goals across their last four, and are winning in a variety of different ways, too. \n Whether it is crushing inferior opponents (such as beating Burnley 6-0), coming back from a goal down to  defeat Liverpool 4-1 , or in a 4-1 win at Southampton on Saturday, waiting patiently for the opening. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n SOU \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 4 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n It took 45 minutes before  Erling Haaland  gave his team the lead, and from then on there was only ever going to be one winner.\u00a0 \n Haaland, who later added an outrageous bicycle kick, now has 30 Premier League goals this season and is on track to obliterate the record of 34 jointly held by  Andrew Cole  and  Alan Shearer . \u00a0 \n Yet it was  Jack Grealish , scorer of the second and creator of the third, who again stood out as the star player for Guardiola\u2019s side. \u00a0 \n With 10 goal involvements in 15 Premier League matches since the World Cup, it is his confident, swaggering performances off the left that give the greatest indication City will not seize up in the title race.\u00a0 \n But looks can be deceiving. In his six previous years as City manager, Guardiola has dropped an average of 5.5 points across the final nine matches of a Premier League season. Only in 2018/19 did he win every single one of those nine and last year, locked in battle with Liverpool, Man City won six and drew three.\u00a0\u00a0 \n The title might now be in Man City\u2019s hands as well as Arsenal\u2019s, but historical precedent suggests there will be twists and turns ahead.\u00a0 \n Wilson and Isak strike up partnership \n Alexander Isak \u2019s form had been keeping  Callum Wilson  out of the side but on Saturday, with  Newcastle United  1-0 down at the break,  Eddie Howe  came up with a solution that might be the beginning of a new Premier League strike partnership.\u00a0 \n In the first half, Isak struggled to make an impact and appeared isolated alone up top, making  Brentford  good value for their lead.  Thomas Frank \u2019s side had more shots (six to Newcastle's two) and, but for a missed  Ivan Toney  penalty, would have been 2-0 up at the break.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n BRE \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 2 \n \n NEW \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Credit goes to Howe for making a bold change, moving to a 4-4-2 with Isak lurking just off Wilson, which instantly gave the Swede the help he needed to become a key player in the contest. \n Isak went from 13 touches and five passes in the first half to 20 touches and 13 passes in the second, while both of his shots came in that second 45-minute period, including the winner, assisted by Wilson.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                The build-up to Alexander Isak's winner v Brentford\n             \n \n Isak also had a hand in the equaliser, dropping deep to weave things together before  Bruno Guimaraes  and  Kieran Trippier  combined to release  Joelinton  behind the Brentford defence. \u00a0 \n It was a very smart tactical move from Howe, taking him to 100 Premier League points from 56 matches for Newcastle (28 wins, 16 draws and 12 defeats). Only  Kevin Keegan  has reached that total for the Magpies in fewer matches (51).\u00a0 \n Seagulls tactics let Son shine \n Son Heung-min  became the first Asian player to  reach 100 Premier League goals  courtesy of his 18th strike in the competition struck from outside the box. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 1 \n \n BHA \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Not many of the other 32 players to have reached triple figures can match Son\u2019s showreel in terms of quality and variety. \n He is one of only two players, alongside  Harry Kane , to have scored at least 40 of the 100 with both feet.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Where Son has scored his 100 Premier League goals from\n             \n \n Son has been an outstanding servant for  Tottenham Hotspur  and a rare one at that - he is only the 19th player to reach 100 goals for a single club - but his form has notably dipped in 2022/23. \n Speaking to the Evening Standard , Son said \u201cmore attention and more pressure\u201d following last year\u2019s  Castrol Golden Boot  win has been a factor, before explaining why he was back to his best on Saturday.\u00a0 \n \u201cIt was more a case of position and being able to make the runs I like,\u201d he said. \u201c Brighton  played quite a high line, which gave me space to run in behind.\u201d\u00a0 \n It is certainly true that  Roberto De Zerbi \u2019s side dominated possession, having 65 per cent, and, often leaving  Pascal Gross  and  Moises Caicedo  alone in central midfield as part of an aggressive 3-2-5, Spurs were able to play quick forward passes on the counter-attack to release Kane and Son between the lines, as much as behind the defence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                In the build-up to Kane\u2019s winner, we see Kane and Son (both circled) finding space behind Brighton\u2019s aggressive two-man midfield\n             \n \n \n",
