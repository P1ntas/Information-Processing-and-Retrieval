        "text": "\n While  Erling Haaland  has grabbed the headlines for most of the season with his record-breaking goals,  Ilkay Gundogan  is again the man who is leading  Manchester City  over the finish line in the Premier League title race. \n On the final day last season, the German scored twice as City came from 2-0 down late on to  beat Aston Villa  and lift the Trophy.\u00a0Twelve months on, the German has scored four of City's five goals in their last two victories  over Leeds United  and  Everton . \n On Sunday, when the champions were struggling to break down Everton's defence, Gundogan produced a sensational improvised finish to score the 37th-minute opener, before completing his second successive brace in the second half. \n Alan Shearer , the Premier League's record goalscorer and  Hall of Fame  inductee, has named Gundogan in his Team of the Week, along with two members of the  Brighton & Hove Albion  team who beat City's title rivals  Arsenal 3-0  at Emirates Stadium.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Jason Steele (BHA) It\u2019s not often I pick a goalkeeper for his passing but his bravery with the ball at his feet in tight areas set the tone for Brighton's approach. \n Trent Alexander-Arnold (LIV) After racking up the assists since his move into midfield, this trademark free-kick was another statement proving he is back to his best. \n Raphael Varane (MUN) Man Utd  immediately looked more secure after his return from injury.  Wolves  didn\u2019t get a single shot on target. \n Pervis Estupinan (BHA) Set up the opener before getting into the box again to score the third, while keeping  Bukayo Saka  in his pocket. \n Eberechi Eze (CRY) Two more brilliant goals. In this form, he won\u2019t want the season to end! \n Douglas Luiz (AVL) Loves playing  Spurs . Helped to win the midfield battle, and scored a brilliant free-kick. \n Ilkay Gundogan (MCI) He delivers in the big moments when City are chasing titles and most need a goal. He produced something from nothing with wonderful skill to break the deadlock, before a wonderful free-kick. \n Curtis Jones (LIV) Two goals in three minutes! The youngster has always looked neat and tidy. If he keeps performing like this, he will be hard to leave out. \n Mohamed Salah (LIV) Even when you stop him scoring, he still hurts you, setting up both of Jones\u2019s goals. \u00a0 \n Taiwo Awoniyi (NFO) Hitting form at precisely the right moment.  Chelsea  couldn\u2019t handle him as he scored two headers. He could be what keeps  Forest  up. \n Raheem Sterling (CHE) His second goal in particular gave Chelsea the clinical edge they have been missing for most of the season. \n Manager:  Roberto De Zerbi (BHA) His Brighton team didn\u2019t just beat title contenders  Arsenal , they outplayed them with a bold, quick, passing style that almost every team would love to play. \n",
