Away from home, his 38 shots and 18 shots on target are both among the top two players in FPL this season. \n Jack Grealish  (\u00a36.7m), meanwhile, has produced double-figure hauls in each of  Aston Villa 's away matches at\u00a0 Burnley  and  Brighton & Hove Albion . \n The Villa playmaker will look to continue his strong form on the road at\u00a0 AFC Bournemouth , who have lost five of their last seven matches.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n What the experts say \n Ben McNair  ( @drbenmcnair ): \u00a0 Salah  will be a popular option and rightly so. He looks nailed-on to start, which is more than we can say for alternatives like  Sergio Aguero  (\u00a312.0m). For those looking for a risky differential, Grealish is enticing.   Holly Shand  ( @FFCommunity_ ):\u00a0It's set to be a tough week for captaincy, but I think I've settled on  Salah . He's been excellent at home this season and Anfield is an absolute fortress for Liverpool. \n Sam Bonfield  ( @FPLFamily ): There is one standout choice on paper:\u00a0 Salah  at home to Southampton. Saints have been excellent lately and are proving much more solid defensively. However, I think with the Mane injury, Salah will be the main focus of Liverpool's attack and I expect them to score. It's likely Salah will have a hand in the goals. \n Paul Gee  ( @FplPaulGee ):  Salah  is going to be the easy pick this week. He continues to get loads of chances and with Mane likely out it's an obvious choice. A differential captain could be Aguero, but personally I like to captain him at home. \n Lee Bonfield  ( @FPL Family ):\u00a0Over the last few weeks, I feel like I've done a lot of overthinking in FPL, including taking a hit for Mane Triple Captain! This week, I'm keeping it simple.  Salah 's in form and at Anfield where he tends to flourish. Saints' away form is good, but Liverpool's home form is imperious. \n Also in this series\u00a0 \n Part 2:  GW25 Captains: Aguero has shot at top pick \n",

        "text": "\n The Bonus Points Harry Kane' s (\u00a310.9m) second-half strike proved decisive  against Sunderland , helping the forward earn his first Fantasy Premier League bonus points of the season. \n His second goal in as many Premier League matches, Kane's FPL prospects were on the up before being put back on ice as he succumbed to an ankle problem. \n Five key passes and three successful tackles helped Kane claim the maximum three points via 38 in the Bonus Point System (BPS). \n His close-range winner was coupled with a third clean sheet for the Tottenham Hotspur defence, which earned recognition for full-backs  Kyle Walker  (\u00a35.7m) and  Jan Vertonghen  (\u00a35.5m). \n Walker also won three tackles along with five recoveries as he collected 33 BPS to win two points; the defender has been awarded bonus points in all four of the Premier League matches he has completed this season. \n Mauricio Pochettino  elected to shift Jan Vertonghen to left-back in the absence of  Danny Rose  (\u00a36.0m) through injury and the Belgian responded by claiming a single bonus point. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Vertonghen won two tackles and contributed 11 clearances, blocks and interceptions for 32 BPS. \n The ICT Index \n Kane topped the  ICT Index  with his highest tally of the season so far, earning 21.8. \n The striker fired in three efforts on target, all from inside the box to return the biggest Threat score on show (109). \n Together with  Heung-min Son  (\u00a37.4m), he dominated in the Index as Spurs amassed a staggering 31 attempts on goal. \n The South Korean contributed another eye-catching shift to follow his two-goal haul at Stoke City in Gameweek 4. \n Son earned 17.8 on the Index in that game, but bettered that against Sunderland, registering 18.4 overall. \n He supplied the most passes in the final third, finding the target with six of 15 crosses on his way to providing five chances for team-mates. \n Son was also a constant threat, firing in no less than seven attempts on goal, five from within the penalty area. \n The Scout Notes Kane's setback soured the Spurs victory, although the club have yet to reveal the extent of the injury. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Sunderland goalkeeper Jordan Pickford was in the thick of the action against Spurs on Sunday\n             \n \n Should he face a spell on the sidelines, FPL managers will be alerted to the potential of his likely replacement,  Vincent Janssen  (\u00a37.8m). Son's effervescent displays are beginning to warrant attention.\u00a0He has started the last three in all competitions and could represent outstanding value.  Erik Lamela 's (\u00a37.1m) starting role continues to be in doubt, with  Christian Eriksen  (\u00a38.4m) also looking far from secure having given way to  Moussa Sissoko  (\u00a37.0m) for Sunday's win. \n Prospects in the Sunderland camp look dim following four defeats in five. \n Jordan Pickford  (\u00a34.0m) provides the one bright spark. \n Outstanding at White Hart Lane, the 22-year-old has returned two save points in each of his three starts thus far. \n In attack,  Jermain Defoe  (\u00a37.2m) was starved of service throughout but will now look to back-to-back home encounters for improvement. \n",

Sterling is the third-most popular midfielder in FPL, residing in 24.9% of squads. \n Sergio Aguero  (\u00a313.1m) allayed fears of a calf complaint by turning out for Argentina in midweek. Despite playing in the early hours of Wednesday morning, he looks in line to start up front against the Toffees. \n Romelu Lukaku  (\u00a39.4m) has shrugged off a thigh complaint in time for the Etihad Stadium encounter. Everton's top scorer has produced five goals and an assist in his last four outings. \n Ronald Koeman  also welcomes back two of his first-choice back-four, with  Leighton Baines  (\u00a35.5m) and  Phil Jagielka  (\u00a35.1m) overcoming knocks. \n Chelsea skipper  John Terry  (\u00a35.4m) is in contention for the  visit of champions Leicester City . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Antonio Conte  opted for a 3-4-3 formation last time and faces a central defensive dilemma.

Pedro  (\u00a37.1m) or  Victor Moses  (\u00a35.5m) - if he recovers from a hamstring problem - could line up on the right of a front three. \n Meanwhilie,  Southampton 's chances of a fourth successive clean sheet are dented by the news that first-choice full-backs  Ryan Bertrand  (\u00a35.4m) and  Cedric Soares  (\u00a35.0m) have been sidelined through injury. \n Claude Puel  may now turn to  Matt Targett  (\u00a34.4m) and  Cuco Martina  (\u00a34.3m) as the Saints face a Clarets side who have yet to score on their travels. \n For all the latest\u00a0Fantasy talking points, follow  @OfficialFPL  on Twitter.

Lamptey has scored once and supplied three assists in the opening seven Gameweeks. \n Aaron Cresswell (WHU) \u00a35.1m \n His three assists and 13 chances created both rank joint-top among defenders this season. Cresswell can bring in more returns for  West Ham United  at home against\u00a0 Fulham  on Saturday. \n Ben Chilwell (CHE) \u00a35.9m \n Chelsea 's left-back offers strong all-round potential at home against\u00a0 Sheffield United .

Son visits  West Bromwich Albion  having picked up 53 points in his three road trips. \n Sadio Mane (LIV) \u00a312.0m \n The Senegalese has scored in both his away appearances in 2020/21, producing three goals and 22 points. Mane can make the difference as  Liverpool  travel to  Manchester City  on Sunday. \n Bruno Fernandes (MUN) \u00a310.5m \n Manchester United 's playmaker visits an Everton side who have conceded twice in five of their last six matches. Fernandes has created 12 chances in the last four Gameweeks, joint-top among all players in FPL. \n Pablo Fornals (WHU) \u00a36.4m \n The West Ham winger has produced double-figure hauls against  Leicester City  and Liverpool in the last four Gameweeks. Fornals faces a Fulham defence that has conceded at least three goals in three of their seven fixtures. \n Harry Kane (TOT) \u00a311.0m \n Spurs' most consistent attacker this season, he has scored or assisted in six successive Gameweeks.

The Scout's  series on players being overlooked  by managers continues. \n Sadio Mane (Liverpool) \u00a39.5m \n Managers have been slow to return to  Liverpool 's  Sadio Mane  (\u00a39.5m) as an FPL option. \n Sitting in only 11.7% of squads, the Senegal international is the Reds' fourth-most popular pick. \n Fellow midfielders  Philippe Coutinho  and  Mohamed Salah  (both \u00a39.0m) are owned by 28.1% and 18.5% respectively, while 16.5% have opted for  Roberto Firmino  (\u00a38.5m) in their forward line. \n But Mane can outscore them all. \n His average of 5.8 points per match (ppm) was more than any Liverpool player last term. It bettered Mane's two seasons at  Southampton , which produced 4.3ppm and 4.6ppm. \n Despite missing the final eight Gameweeks due to a knee injury, he was the Reds\u2019 joint-top scorer with Coutinho on 13 goals apiece. \n However, Mane was far more clinical and converted 22.8% of his chances to the Brazilian\u2019s 12.3%. \n Only  AFC Bournemouth \u2019s  Joshua King  (\u00a37.5m and 23.9%) boasted a stronger goal conversion rate among last season\u2019s FPL midfielders.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n A consistent points scorer, Mane never went more than two Gameweek appearances without scoring in 2016/17. \n Recently recovered from injury, he has made an immediate impact on Liverpool\u2019s attack. \n Mane supplied an assist against Hertha Berlin in his first start of  pre-season , then followed that with the opener in a 3-0 win over Bayern Munich. \n Set to feature on the wing in manager  Jurgen Klopp \u2019s 4-3-3 formation, Mane can also play through the middle should the Reds use a midfield diamond. \n The  opening schedule  suggests he could start strongly, too. \n Liverpool\u2019s first two fixtures - against  Watford  and  Crystal Palace  \u2013 both score only two in the  Fixture Difficulty Rankings  (FDR). \n If Mane can match his FPL scoring rate from his first season on Merseyside, he will not remain in the shadow of his team-mates for long. \n Reminder - GW1 deadline is Friday 11 August, 18:45 BST \n See:  The Scout's second overlooked player \n",

        "text": "\n A man-of-the match performance from  Sadio Mane  (\u00a38.9million) lit up last night\u2019s EFL Cup, boosting his Fantasy Premier League prospects with two\u00a0assists in  Liverpool \u2019s 5-0 win against\u00a0Burton Albion.\u00a0 \n Having scored a stunning solo goal in the opening weekend  4-3 victory over Arsenal , Mane missed the\u00a0the Gameweek 2  defeat at Burnley \u00a0with\u00a0a shoulder injury in training.\u00a0 \n This caused\u00a0his  Fantasy Premier League  ownership to dip, but\u00a0Mane is still owned by more than 440,000 managers, who will be confident of further points returns heading into Saturday\u2019s  trip to Tottenham Hotspur . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Everton  also eased their way into the next round as\u00a0 Ronald Koeman  used the 4-0 win over Yeovil Town to give 90 minutes to new signings  Ashley Williams  (\u00a35.0m) and  Yannick Bolasie  (\u00a36.0m). Both are likely to figure from the start\u00a0 against Stoke City  in Gameweek 3. \n Romelu Lukaku  (\u00a39.0m) also handed a first start and completed the 90 minutes. \n The Belgian looks to be restored as an FPL option that could yet break up the established strike pairing of  Sergio Aguero  (\u00a313.1m) and  Zlatan Ibrahimovic  (\u00a311.7m) in FPL squads, especially with a kind run of\u00a0fixtures for Lukaku. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Everton's favourable fixture schedule make Lukaku a tempting FPL option\n             \n \n Everton face Stoke City, Middlesbrough and Crystal Palace at home and travel to Sunderland and AFC Bournemouth over the next five Gameweeks. \n Christian Benteke  (\u00a37.4m) is another who will come on to\u00a0the radar as a forward\u00a0option. \n He was handed his debt\u00a0for  Crystal Palace  in their 2-0 win over Blackpool. Taken off to be preserved at the half-way mark, Benteke seems\u00a0likely to start  against AFC Bournemouth  on Saturday. \n Michy Batshuayi  (\u00a39.0m) is another Belgian forward vying for our attention. \n He claimed a goal and an assist in\u00a0cameo roles over the first two Gameweeks but scored\u00a0twice\u00a0against Bristol Rovers on Tuesday, providing another reminder of his talents to  Chelsea  head coach  Antonio Conte . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Michy Batshuayi netted twice on his first Chelsea start on Tuesday night\n             \n \n Etienne Capoue  (\u00a34.6m) came\u00a0off the bench but could not\u00a0stop\u00a0 Watford \u00a0from a shock home defeat to\u00a0Gillingham. \n The Frenchman was an injury doubt having suffered a calf problem  against Chelsea  at the weekend. His availability for Gameweek 3's  hosting of Arsenal  will be welcomed by the 150,000 managers to have transferred him in. \n Swansea City \u2019s  Neil Taylor  (\u00a34.4m) also returned to action as the Welsh club progressed to\u00a0the second round. \n The left-back will challenge  Stephen Kingsley  (\u00a34.1m) for a start  at Leicester City  on Saturday. \n Kingsley has been the most popular defensive signing so far this season, attracting 199,083 new owners since the Gameweek 1 deadline. \n But he could lose his place as  Francesco Guidolin  considers his choice of full-back tasked with containing the talents of  Riyad Mahrez  (\u00a39.5m) at the weekend. \n",

        "text": "\n Liverpool  have not beaten  Arsenal  since an unforgettable  5-1 thrashing  at Anfield in February 2014, but recent history suggests the first match of a new campaign is a good time to face Arsene Wenger\u2019s men. \n Winning just one of their last six opening-day encounters, Arsenal are renowned slow starters. \n How will  Sunday\u2019s glamorous match  between the two giants pan out at Emirates Stadium? Adrian Clarke tells us what to expect. \n Chances galore \n Arsenal and Liverpool usually serve up absorbing contests, and this weekend\u2019s meeting is unlikely to buck the trend. \n With both managers troubled by defensive concerns ahead of kick-off, each are likely to be encouraged to play with even more positive intent than usual. \n Wenger has to decide whether to pair youngsters  Calum Chambers  and Rob Holding in the heart of his back four, or to shift a full-back ( Nacho Monreal  or  Mathieu Debuchy ) inside to play alongside one of the rookies. It\u2019s a difficult call. \n Left-back is the area providing headaches for  Jurgen Klopp . With Jose Enrique, Brad Smith and Jon Flanagan no longer at the club, he must choose between an out-of-favour  Alberto Moreno  or  James Milner  who is in a race to be fit.\u00a0 \n Well aware of those potential weak spots and eager to seize on them, I envisage both managers instructing their teams to play on the front foot in enterprising fashion. \n This should make for a match packed with chances, which is nothing unusual when Arsenal and Liverpool collide. Their last five Premier League meetings have featured an average of 4.2 goals, and over 33 shots per match. \n Shots in last five meetings \n \n \n \n Venue \n Score \n Arsenal shots \n Liverpool shots \n Total Shots \n \n \n \n \n Anfield \n 3-3 \n 14 \n 22 \n 36 \n \n \n Emirates \n 0-0 \n 19 \n 15 \n 34 \n \n \n Emirates \n 4-1 \n 16 \n 13 \n 29 \n \n \n Anfield \n 2-2 \n 7 \n 27 \n 34 \n \n \n Anfield \n 5-1 \n 11 \n 22 \n 33 \n \n \n \n The menace of Mane \n Liverpool new boy  Sadio Mane  is the player Arsenal will fear most. \n When he was at Southampton, Arsenal struggled to cope with his pace, directness and movement. Popping up in dangerous areas, either running into space or taking defenders on with the ball at his feet, the Senegalese star proved a constant thorn in their side. His unpredictable positioning will again test the home side\u2019s decision-making. \n Expected to start on the right, Mane will drop into pockets between the full-back and his closest centre-back and, where possible, in the channel that also separates Arsenal\u2019s rearguard and midfield. \n This will ask questions of who in the Arsenal team should get tightest to him. Is it the left-back, the central defender, or perhaps somebody from the midfield? \n Depending on the situation, all of the above will have to muck in at some stage. Decisive calls will need to be made, or else he will turn unopposed and wreak havoc. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n When Arsenal\u2019s left-back opts to get touch-tight to Mane - I suspect this will happen most often - keep your eye on Liverpool trying to pick out the overlapping runs of  Nathaniel Clyne  in the space that\u2019s left in behind. The right-back\u2019s marauding down that flank must be closely tracked, when the winger is infield. \n Mane enjoys breaking into the penalty area from central positions. When play is building up and he ventures towards the box, it\u2019s imperative for Arsenal\u2019s communication to be clear. Nine times out of 10 it will be down to one of the centre-backs to take responsibility for him. \n It\u2019s not hard to understand why Klopp was so eager to bring the 24-year-old to Anfield. Flexible enough to play in any of the forward positions, his speed and trickery will stretch opponents in a way Liverpool could not last term. Excellent at recovering possession high up the pitch, he is also an attacker who will buy into his manager\u2019s methods. \n With a touch more polish in front of goal, Mane is capable of netting more than the 11 goals he scored last term, when he was the joint second-highest scoring Premier League midfielder.  Arsenal will be acutely aware of the threat he poses on Sunday. \n Mane's 2015/16 numbers \n \n \n \n Ball recoveries \n 28 \n \n \n Times won possession in final third \n 26 \n \n \n Times fouled \n 69 \n \n \n Chances created \n 41 \n \n \n Goals scored \n 11 \n \n \n Big chances missed \n 12 \n \n \n \n Pressing matters \n Arsenal and Liverpool have both been noticeably aggressive with their pressing during pre-season. Based on what we have seen this summer, both sets of players will hunt in packs to stop the other from playing out from back. \n The Gunners didn\u2019t always adopt this approach last term, but with fresh early-season legs and either Alexis Sanchez or  Theo Walcott  leading the line it will suit them to perform at a higher tempo. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Liverpool's opposition-half turnovers v Arsenal last season\n(Tackles: Green; Interceptions: Blue; Recoveries: Yellow)\n             \n \n In last weekend\u2019s 3-2 victory over Manchester City, Arsenal won the ball back in advanced areas time and again, scoring their third goal from a quality turnover. \n Liverpool also pressed brilliantly in their 4-0 friendly win against Barcelona at Wembley Stadium, preventing the Spanish champions from finding any fluency in their passing. They will seek a repeat, and try to knock Arsenal out of their stride. \n In last season\u2019s clash at Emirates Stadium (see Figure 1 above) they were quite superb at disrupting Arsenal\u2019s flow. Unsettled by well-organised closing down, Wenger\u2019s players lost the ball more than 30 times inside their own half, gifting a succession of chances in the process. \n Arsenal and Liverpool both have defenders who prefer passing out from the back, but they must be extremely careful on Sunday. To avoid unnecessary risks, we may see a lot of longer passes attempted. \n Inside the midfield, the sharpest minds will prevail. The team who find the greater cohesion with bright, one and two-touch passing is likely to gain control. Time on the ball will be minimal. \n Final thoughts \n I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Arsenal and Liverpool mirror one another stylistically on the opening weekend. \n They will both look to be hostile with their pressing, all four full-backs will try to fly forward whenever they can and, in  Aaron Ramsey  and  Georginio Wijnaldum , they each have an attacking midfielder who wants to regularly break into the box. \n Unusually, there is also a strong possibility that both managers will opt to start with a withdrawn centre-forward, in preference to a target man.  Alexis Sanchez  and  Roberto Firmino  are in pole position to fulfil those roles. \n I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that these two Premier League big guns are stronger from the halfway line onwards, and with neither back four at full strength or especially convincing, we should see a glut of opportunities created. \n Just like recent meetings between these two clubs, the goalkeepers should be kept nice and busy. \n \u00a0 \n",

He has one goal and one assist in the last six Gameweeks. \n Manchester City  duo  Raheem Sterling  (\u00a312.1m) and  Kevin De Bruyne  (\u00a310.2m) were also major disappointments. \n The most-selected captain in Gameweek 11, Sterling returned only a single point at home against\u00a0 Southampton . \n Having started the season with five goals in Man City's first three fixtures, he has only two goals and one assist in the last eight Gameweeks. \n De Bruyne has also suffered a drop in form, with only one assist from Gameweek 8 onwards. \n Strong fixtures after City duel \n Mane's impact against Villa highlights an improvement in his all-round FPL potential. \n He has scored six goals and also supplied four assists, already bettering his total of three assists from 2018/19. \n A home encounter with Man City this weekend may deter many managers from bringing in the Liverpool winger. \n But the Reds' schedule from Gameweek 13 onwards gives Mane the chance to maintain his momentum. \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), four of their subsequent five matches score only two. \n That run also raises the appeal of Salah, offering managers a strong double-up option before Liverpool's blank Gameweek 18. \n What the experts say \n Paul Gee  ( @FPLPaulGee ): You can't ignore Mane. But by the time Liverpool start their kind run of fixtures Salah is going to be a differential, with only 27.8 per cent ownership now and hopefully with his ongoing ankle issues sorted out. \n Holly Shand  ( @FFCommunity_ ): It seemed a tough decision a couple of weeks ago to make the move from Salah to Mane but I haven't looked back. Salah could be hampered by injury for some time so the switch looks logical and, with Man City having a tough run of matches ahead, a move from one of their midfielders to Mane could be viable too. \n Sam Bonfield  ( @FPLFamily ): As a Salah owner, Mane's form is really starting to hurt. Mane is the premium asset to own right now and, with Salah's ankle still causing him issues, the switch to Mane is definitely on. \n Lee Bonfield  ( @FPLFamily ): A move to Mane looks a safe bet ahead of a great run of Liverpool fixtures. Mane was FPL's top scorer until  Jamie Vardy \u00a0(\u00a39.4m) scored his late goal at Selhurst Park and again looked dangerous against Villa. I have him in my team and he's a genuine captaincy option most weeks after the Man City clash. \n Ben Crabtree \u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ): Mane looks the best premium option at the moment, including forwards. But I feel Sterling sellers will soon have regrets, even though his fixtures are becoming more difficult. \n Mark McGettigan  ( @FPLGeneral ): My midfield let me down in Gameweek 11, scoring only seven points! It's time for a bit of a shake-up in that area. Either Salah or Sterling could go this week to accommodate Vardy up front. If Salah goes, Mane will come in after the Man City fixture. He's the Liverpool midfielder I want long term. \n Neal Thurman \u00a0( @nealjthurman ): It's hard to justify switching back and forth between Salah and Mane as each go through ups and downs in form. I'd pick one and stick with him unless there's an injury. if you're choosing now, I'd start with Mane. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Ben McNair  ( @drbenmcnair ) : I baulked a little at Mane\u2019s price at the start of the season, but with 20 league goals already this calendar year he's justified the price tag. Salah still has the advantage of taking penalties but seems to be below his best. Perhaps it\u2019s his troublesome ankle or the extra attention he seems to get from opponents, but Salah can\u2019t match Mane\u2019s goal threat from open play this season. \n \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 GW11 Lessons: Resilient Blades a gift for FPL managers \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n",

More than 125,000 managers have already signed him\u00a0ahead of the Gameweek 31 deadline of 14:00 GMT on Saturday. \n With  Liverpool  being one of only eight teams with fixtures in Gameweek 31, the Brazilian is a clear favourite to replace Kane or Aguero in squads. \n But what about those managers already with Firmino? \n Some short-term options with Gameweek 31 in mind are\u00a0 Steve Mounie  (\u00a35.8m),  Cenk Tosun  (\u00a36.7m) or  Christian Benteke  (\u00a37.6m), who are all in action this weekend. \n Lukaku for long term? \n But in the long term,  Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang  (\u00a310.4m) and  Romelu Lukaku  (\u00a311.2m) could emerge as the main alternatives, particularly as replacements for Aguero. \n With  Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a39.9m) back in contention for City, Aguero\u2019s minutes are likely to be managed by  Pep Guardiola  over the remaining Gameweeks. \n The Kane situation is more problematic for managers. \n As the most expensive player in the game, benching him is a difficult option to consider, with his price set to plummet. \n Captain candidate \n But when selling Kane, managers should also devise a plan to re-sign him on his return. \n Spurs will have at least one Double Gameweek - two fixtures in a single Gameweek - later in the season, and a fit-again Kane is sure to be a target as captain. \n There is a chance he may even be in contention for Gameweek 34, which might involve two home fixtures against Manchester City and  Newcastle United . \n The double Gameweek fixtures are expected to be confirmed after this weekend\u2019s FA Cup quarter-finals, on or around March 19. \n Gameweek 31 fixtures\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n BOU \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 1 \n \n WBA \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n HUD \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 2 \n \n CRY \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n STK \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 2 \n \n EVE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n LIV \n \n \n \n \n 5 - 0 \n \n WAT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                    View All\n                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

Their average goals per match has dropped from 2.1 to 1.2 when without the striker. \n Six goals were scored in Kane's absence from Gameweeks 6-10, with Son and  Dele Alli  (\u00a38.7m) both netting twice. \n But an assist for Son in that period helped him emerge as Spurs\u2019 top scoring FPL asset without Kane in the side. \n Spurs' assets without Kane\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Player\u00a0 \n Starts \n Goals \n Assists \n Bonus points \n FPL points \n \n \n \n \n Son \n 4 \n 2 \n 1 \n 3 \n 26 \n \n \n Alli \n 5 \n 2 \n 0 \n 3 \n 24 \n \n \n Eriksen \n 3 \n 1 \n 0 \n 3 \n 18 \n \n \n Janssen \n 5 \n 0 \n 1 \n 0 \n 15 \n \n \n \n Sunday\u2019s meeting with Southampton should offer Son another opportunity to flourish. \n Saints have conceded eight goals in their last four matches, as they continue to struggle at the back without the injured\u00a0 Virgil van Dijk  (\u00a35.6m). \n Spurs' short-term schedule is also very promising, with trips to Burnley and Swansea City, together with favourable home fixtures against Watford and AFC Bournemouth to come. \n Kane could remain sidelined for that entire period, providing Son with the platform to lead the Spurs attack and perhaps also assume penalty-kick duties. \n While the credentials of both Alli and  Christian Eriksen  (\u00a38.6m) is not in doubt, they could be overshadowed by Son over forthcoming Gameweeks, presenting FPL managers with an outstanding value differential. \n",

He also contributed seven recoveries and won two tackles. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                A first clean sheet since  GW19 helped earn Simon Mignolet two bonus points\n             \n \n The ICT Index \n Mane sealed top spot in the\u00a0 ICT Index  thanks to a score of 17.7 \u2013 his highest of the season. \n Mauricio Pochettino's side failed to contain Liverpool's two-goal hero in a sparkling first-half performance, as Mane fired four efforts on target, all from inside the box. \n Philippe Coutinho  (\u00a38.2m) and  Roberto Firmino  (\u00a38.4m) occupied second and third positions in the Index, with 9.3 and 7.3 respectively. \n Coutinho created a trio of scoring opportunities, while two of his three efforts on goal arrived from inside the Spurs penalty area. \n Firmino completed more passes in the attacking third (23) than any player at Anfield and supplied an assist for Mane\u2019s second, while also firing two goal attempts.\u00a0 \n \n The Scout Notes \n Despite missing two matches due to the Africa Cup of Nations, Mane\u2019s brace and bonus points helped him climb to fourth in the FPL midfield standings on 132 points. \n See:  FPL midfield standings \n FPL managers have wasted no time in returning to Mane. \n Having scored at Anfield for the first time since Gameweek 11, the winger has been transferred in by more than 80,000 new owners ahead of a Gameweek 26 trip to Leicester City. \n But would-be investors should be aware that the Reds could be without a fixture in Gameweek 28 if their opponents that weekend, Burnley, book a place in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. \n Elsewhere in the Liverpool\u00a0midfield, Firmino has two goals and an assist in four outings since Coutinho returned to the starting line-up following injury. \n Wijnaldum has also stepped up his form, with two goals and a pair of assists in his last six Gameweek appearances, having returned to Jurgen Klopp\u2019s teamsheet at the weekend.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Harry Kane has a single goal in his last four Gameweeks and is suffering FPL sales\n             \n \n Spurs, meanwhile, have scored only one goal in the last three outings. \n The absence of  Danny Rose  (\u00a36.0m) has forced Pochettino to abandon his three-man defence, which appears to have\u00a0hurt his side's creative output. \n FPL managers are rapidly losing patience with  Harry Kane  (\u00a311.2m). \n Second only to Liverpool\u2019s  Adam Lallana  (\u00a37.1m) for transfers out last week, the striker has scored once in four Gameweeks. \n Despite boasting back-to-back home encounters against Stoke City and Everton, Kane has been sold by more than 12,000 FPL managers since Saturday's deadline.\u00a0 \n \n \n Dele's price is on the decline in  #FPL ...  pic.twitter.com/1zagULWSfY \n\u2014 FPL (@OfficialFPL)  February 13, 2017 \n \n Similarly, both  Dele Alli \u00a0(\u00a38.8m), with one goal in five, and  Christian Eriksen  (\u00a38.7m), who has produced four successive blanks, are being ushered out of squads at pace. \n Sold by more than 19,000 and 15,000 respectively, they are among the top-five most transferred out midfielders in the Gameweek. \n The prospect of a future postponement is perhaps a factor in this current trend. \n Their trip to Crystal Palace in Gameweek 28 would be rescheduled should Spurs beat Fulham in the FA Cup fifth round. \n",

        "text": "\n Sadio Mane 's (\u00a39.4m) hamstring injury could persuade more  Fantasy Premier League  managers to look to  Philippe Coutinho  (\u00a39.0m). \n With two goals and an assist in the last two Gameweeks, the Brazilian has earned 92,000+ new owners ahead of Saturday's 11:30 BST deadline. \n Interest could now escalate following Mane's setback. \n The winger is ruled out of Saturday's meeting with  Manchester United  and could be sidelined for up to six weeks with the injury sustained on international duty with Senegal. \n Coutinho retreated to a central midfield role at  Newcastle United  in Gameweek 7 but could now shift to the left of  Jurgen Klopp 's front three. \n Since returning to action in Gameweek 5, he has produced more shots (17) and key passes (14) than any other player. \n Mane's absence will also allow\u00a0 Roberto Firmino  (\u00a38.5m) to push for a return to the starting XI. \n He dropped to the bench for the first time this season against the Magpies. \n Firmino's recent lack of points - with only one goal in six Gameweeks - has led to over 132,000 sales. \n Renewed interest in  Liverpool \u00a0options could soon be driven by an improving schedule of fixtures. \n From Gameweek 10, seven of their subsequent nine opponents score only two in the  Fixture Difficulty Rankings  (FDR). \n But FPL managers should be wary of the impact of Mane's absence on Liverpool's attack. \n The winger recently missed Gameweeks 5 and 6 through suspension. \n During those matches, against  Burnley  and  Leicester City , Klopp's men created fewer big chances - or chances where the receiving player should score. \n Having recorded 3.2 big chances per match in Gameweeks 1-4, this fell to only 1.5 without Mane. \n Indeed, since Mane's arrival on Merseyside, Liverpool have scored 2.2 goals per Premier League match with him in their line-up and 1.5 goals without him. \n See:  The Scout's GW8 Ones to watch \n",

        "text": "\n A recent injury to Trent Alexander-Arnold (\u00a37.4m) has sparked big sales among  Fantasy Premier League  squads. \n The  Liverpool  right-back is the most-sold player in the Gameweek, moved on by 230,000+ managers ahead of a Gameweek 9 meeting with  Leicester City . \n Alexander-Arnold is a major doubt for that match and could join Joseph Gomez (\u00a35.4m) and Virgil van Dijk (\u00a36.3m)\u00a0on the sidelines. \n With Gomez undergoing knee surgery on Thursday, the Reds could be without three of their first-choice back four for the upcoming period. \n As more owners start to look elsewhere, The Scout\u2019s panel of experts offer their thoughts on Liverpool defenders and who can replace them in FPL. \n What the experts say \n Geoff Dance ( @GeoffreyDance ) \n When fit the Liverpool full-backs are always an attacking threat. But with their injuries they are likely to keep fewer clean sheets. Most-owned defender  Ben Chilwell  (\u00a36.0m) is a clear replacement. \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n In all of pre-season I never considered building a team without Alexander-Arnold. His quality and value for his price last season were second to none. \n This season the clean sheets have dried up and the attacking returns just aren't there to make spending so much of your FPL budget on the Liverpool defence worth it. \n I'm buying a slightly cheaper defender in  Chelsea 's  Chilwell  and then reinvesting the money saved to afford\u00a0 Manchester City \u00a0midfielder Kevin De Bruyne (\u00a311.5m) from Gameweek 10. \n Pranil Sheth ( @Lateriser12 )\u00a0 \n Liverpool have kept four clean sheets in the last 18 Premier League matches. Cheaper premium options have been outscoring them for a while now. They will always have potential but with picks like  Chilwell  emerging, their value diminishes. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n The Liverpool defence have kept just one clean sheet this season and in Van Dijk's absence their price cannot be justified.  Chilwell  is now the most-owned defender in the game and had three shots on target against  Sheffield United  alone. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n With a heavy heart, I have to say that Trent and Andrew Robertson (\u00a37.1m) both look unworthy of their hefty price tags, especially as a number of defenders are emerging in the next bracket down. Consider  Chilwell ,  Aaron Cresswell  (\u00a35.1m) of  West Ham United  and Man City's  Joao Cancelo  (\u00a35.4m). \n Ben Crabtree\u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n Given there's other defenders offering clean sheet and attacking potential, funds can be freed up by switching to  Crystal Palace  left-back  Patrick van Aanholt  (\u00a35.4m), Cancelo or Chilwell. \n Neal Thurman\u00a0( @nealjthurman ) \n Between the injuries to Alisson (\u00a35.9m) and Van Dijk, I've been out on the Liverpool defence since early in the season. I don't see any reason to expect them to justify their prices. \n Ben McNair ( @ drbenmcnair ) \n Gomez's injury was the final straw for me. I'm a huge fan of Robertson and Alexander-Arnold as FPL assets and they have wonderful fixtures from Gameweek 12, but I can't see many clean sheets with youngsters and an injury-prone Joel Matip (\u00a35.4m) playing at centre-back. \n Chuck Booth\u00a0( @ChuckBoothSport ) \n If you have Alexander-Arnold I'd save funds by going for\u00a0 Chilwell . But I'm holding Robertson for a few more weeks to see what happens. It's dependent on team funds but the hope is that with Thiago (\u00a35.9m) and Fabinho (\u00a35.4m) coming back, clean sheets will return too. \n Holly Shand ( @FFCommunity_ ) \n Anyone still on Liverpool defenders needs to move on now, with a host of premium options on offer. I've already boarded the Chilwell train, but I can see plenty of potential both attacking and defensively in  Cancelo , with Man City's fixture swing coming in Gameweek 10. \n Nick ( @WGTA_Nick )\u00a0\u00a0 \n I still have Robertson and with other issues in my team, I don't feel like there is an urgent rush to sell or take a hit. He has registered three attacking returns this season and there is definitely a chance of clean sheets in the next five. He may be expensive, but he has proved his quality over the past couple of seasons. \n See:  Official FPL panellists league \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  West Ham duo lead Saiss replacements Part 3:  Ziyech the real deal Part 4:  Seek out value up front Part 5:\u00a0 Soucek among best differentials Part 6:  De Bruyne and Fernandes the top targets \n",

        "summary": "Draft expert Neal Thurman of Rotoworld looks at the best options ahead of Gameweek 6",
        "text": "\n The injuries have been coming fast and furious, leaving  Fantasy Premier League Draft  managers wondering how to cope with their current squads. \n Players such as  Alexandre Lacazette ,\u00a0 Aymeric Laporte ,\u00a0 Anthony Martial \u00a0and\u00a0 Paul Pogba \u00a0have all been in the treatment room, and the likes of\u00a0 Daniel James \u00a0and\u00a0 Mason Mount \u00a0are now doubts. \n It's enough to have Draft managers starting to contemplate dropping some big-name players rather than facing some inevitable zeroes in the short-term while waiting for a number of minor injuries to play out. \n Each situation is different so there's no blanket advice I can give on this front. \n What I can do, as always, is suggest waiver priorities for those in the market to make a move for Gameweek 6. \n GKP: Angus Gunn (SOU) \n Gunn and  Vicente Guaita \u00a0may well be available in eight-team leagues and are both solid choices for Gameweek 6. If you're looking for a longer-term hold then I'd prioritise Gunn. If you need a shorter-term solution for the next three weeks or so, maybe until  Alisson  comes back, then Guaita has a more favourable schedule up until the first week of October. \n DEF: Emil Krafth (NEW) \n Newcastle United  have a solid home match against  Brighton & Hove Albion  and two new wing-backs who could offer short-term value.  Jetro Willems  had the highlight-reel goal last weekend but I'd actually favour Krafth. Based on my watching of the match last weekend, Krafth tends to get into the attack more regularly, even if it hasn't paid off yet. \n If you're wondering why I'm not in on  Manchester City 's\u00a0 Joao Cancelo , I just don't think he's going to get a run. I suspect  Fernandinho \u00a0will partner\u00a0 Nicolas Otamendi  and  Kyle Walker \u00a0will stay where he is at right-back. If you're looking for a home run rather than a short-term filler, though, Cancelo is the gamble to take. \n MID: Ross Barkley (CHE) \n It's hard to like the match-up this week for  Chelsea , with  Liverpool  coming to Stamford Bridge. But the Blues have been scoring and, with Mount doubtful, Barkley could start. Liverpool haven't exactly been airtight at the back so unless you're diving in on someone like  Solly March  as a steady option at the back of your bench, Barkley has the most immediate upside. \n FWD: Gerard Deulofeu (WAT) \n Maybe this will be Deulofeu's breakthrough weekend. There's certainly no guarantee that he's available in your league but the hope is that someone got fed up with his lack of output and dropped him before Arsenal gifted him a productive Fantasy day last weekend.  Neal Maupay ,  Wesley  and  Dominic Calvert-Lewin  are other options to consider if Deulofeu isn't available. \n",

All but two of his 17 goals have been scored from central positions, from close range within the width of the six-yard box. \n This season, he has shown the positional instinct and finishing prowess of a world-class striker. \n Even though Salah has had 22 more goal attempts than Mane this campaign, with seven matches to go the pair are level on 17 PL goals each at the top of  Liverpool \u2019s goalscoring chart. \n Leading man \n Mane, who boasts a 29.3 per cent conversion rate compared with Salah\u2019s 21.3, has caught up across the last eight PL fixtures, a spell which has coincided with a dip for his fellow attackers. \n Salah has performed well in general play and has had no problems finding shooting positions, but the Egyptian\u2019s efforts have often been from tight angles or some distance from goal. \n Firmino, meanwhile, has played a little too deep, which has affected his own goal threat. \n Liverpool's front three \n \n \n \n Last 8 PL matches\u00a0 \n Mane \n Salah \n Firmino \n \n \n \n \n Mins \n 699 \n 708 \n 466 \n \n \n Touches in box \n 41 \n 76 \n 29 \n \n \n Touches in box in central third \n 22 \n 16 \n 15 \n \n \n Shots \n 16 \n 30 \n 11 \n \n \n Goals \n 8 \n 1 \n 2 \n \n \n \n As for Mane, the key to his extraordinary recent success has been the efficiency of his runs into the penalty area. \n Carefully selecting the right moment to sprint, over half of his touches inside the 18-yard box have been inside the central third, the most likely place to score goals. \n By contrast, only 21 per cent of Salah\u2019s touches in the penalty area have been in that zone. \u00a0 \n All three of Liverpool\u2019s forwards are capable of escaping their markers to score goals, and their collective movement is usually terrific. \n But of the Reds' attacking trio, it is Mane who is the most elusive and predatory at the moment, and he is the player Spurs should fear most this weekend. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Ward-Prowse taking his chance with Southampton Part 3:\u00a0 Spatial awareness taking Sterling to new level Part 4:\u00a0 Gunnarsson can set tone for Cardiff resilience \n",

Salah,  Callum Wilson  (\u00a36.4m) and Mane are the obvious picks.  Mane \u2019s form edges it for me. \n Ben McNair  ( @drbenmcnair ): \u00a0It has to be Salah or Mane. It\u2019s even worth considering the Triple Captain chip if you don\u2019t intend to play it in a Double Gameweek. I\u2019m backing  Salah . He\u2019s looked sharp and Fulham may struggle to double-up on him as effectively as some of Liverpool\u2019s recent opponents. \n Holly Shand  ( @FFCommunity_ ): I have  Salah  as my only Liverpool attacker, so it\u2019s an easy decision.\u00a0 \n Neal Thurman\u00a0 ( @nealjthurman ): Hard to see any non-Liverpool options as captain so it's a coin flip between Salah and Mane. \n Nick and Tom  ( @WGTA_FPL ):  Mane  is my differential captain. He passes the eye test and his underlying statistics in recent matches are impressive. \n Paul Gee  ( @FplPaulGee ):\u00a0As the key contender, it will be  Mane  for me. \n Ben Crabtree\u00a0 ( @FC_CrabDogg ): Using a Free Hit chip, Wilson looks sensible and  Marko Arnautovic  (\u00a36.8m) could be an unlikely hero.
