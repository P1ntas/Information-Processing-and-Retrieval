        "text": "\n Pep Guardiola has put  Fantasy Premier League  managers in a spin ahead of Gameweek 10. \n The  Manchester City  head coach rested both  Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a310.6m) and  Raheem Sterling  (\u00a38.2m) to his bench for Saturday's match against\u00a0 Burnley . \n That pair were two of the top three transfer targets ahead of the weekend, collectively boasting over 673,000 new owners. \n Jesus eventually saw only 14 minutes of action against the Clarets to score one point. \n Meanwhile, Sterling was an unused substitute. When available, he had previously started the last five matches. \n Aside from the immediate disappointment, FPL managers must now consider the ramifications of Guardiola's changes. \n The rest for Sterling may well be as a result of his start in the UEFA Champions League against Napoli three days prior to Saturday's fixture. \n With a return tie against the Italians to come following the Gameweek 10 trip to  West Bromwich Albion , FPL managers should be braced for further rotation. \n Man City also face  Arsenal  at the Etihad Stadium in Gameweek 11. \n This schedule creates uncertainty when assessing Guardiola's options. \n Sterling and Jesus are in the mix to fill three attacking positions in his 4-1-2-3 formation. \n FPL midfielders  Bernardo Silva  (\u00a37.5m) and  Leroy Sane  (\u00a38.6m), along with forward  Sergio Aguero  (\u00a311.7m) are the other candidates. \n The latter is currently the top transfer target for managers, attracting 205,000+ new owners. \n More than 77,000 of those trades have come from Jesus, who is the most sold player ahead of Gameweek 10. \n Depending on Guardiola's selection, that situation could even be reversed following the meeting with the Baggies. \n Having started both Jesus and Aguero in tandem in four of the opening five Gameweeks, injuries have since disrupted that pattern. \n With Sterling and Sane providing such effective support - firing six and five goals respectively - Guardiola may no longer be compelled to field both strikers. \n Tuesday's teamsheet in the Carabao Cup tie with Wolverhampton Wanderers will\u00a0offer further clues. \n But the best strategy may be to reduce the risk by opting for only one of his five attacking options, perhaps pairing them with  David Silva  (\u00a38.6m) or  Kevin De Bruyne  (\u00a310.0m). \n Deployed in deeper midfield roles, they have started every Gameweek fixture. \n A third Man City slot could then be allocated to  Nicolas Otamendi  (\u00a35.9m), who has climbed to the top of the defender standings. \n As Gameweeks pass and when the focus is solely on domestic fixtures, Guardiola's selection policy may settle once more. \n Until then, FPL managers must face the thankless task of second-guessing his intentions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n See:  GW9 bonus points: Otamendi leads the way \n",

        "text": "\n The  Fantasy Premier League  experts have made a double transfer for Gameweek 7. \n They have made use of having two free transfers and \u00a32.7m in the bank to add two\u00a0 Manchester City \u00a0players to the\u00a0 FPL Experts Panel Team . \n Kevin De Bruyne  (\u00a39.9m) and  Nicolas Otamendi  (\u00a35.5m) have been signed following their double-figure hauls against  Watford \u00a0last weekend. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The experts join 281,000+ managers in signing De Bruyne, who is the highest-scoring midfielder in FPL, since the last deadline. \n Otamendi comes in due to providing a secure route into the Man City defence without the injured\u00a0 Aymeric Laporte  (\u00a36.3m) and\u00a0 John Stones \u00a0(\u00a35.4m). \n The Citizens have kept a joint-PL high three clean sheets this season, with their total of 36 shots conceded being fewer than any other side. \n A strong upcoming schedule only adds to Man City's appeal at both ends of the pitch. \n Following this weekend's trip to\u00a0 Everton , all four of their opponents between Gameweeks 8 and 11 score only two in the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings . \n Fraser sold \n The two players making way are  Ryan Fraser  (\u00a37.2m) and  Oleksandr Zinchenko  (\u00a35.5m). \n Fraser has dropped in price by \u00a30.3m on the back of only one goal and an assist for  AFC Bournemouth . \n Zinchenko's place in the Man City defence is no longer guaranteed following the return to fitness of  Benjamin Mendy  (\u00a35.9m). The Ukrainian was rested against Watford with Mendy handed his first start of 2019/20. \n Captain Salah \n Mohamed Salah  (\u00a312.5m) is selected as the experts' captain for Gameweek 7 as  Liverpool  travel to  Sheffield United . The Egyptian has blanked only once in the first six Gameweeks, scoring four goals and supplying three assists. \n Raheem Sterling  (\u00a312.1m) travels to Everton as the vice-captain. Sterling was an unused substitute last weekend and the last time he was rested, in Gameweek 32 last season, he scored two goals on his return to the starting XI. \n What the experts say \n Holly Shand \u00a0( @FFCommunity_ ): Fraser and Zinchenko have become big rotation risks so it makes sense to bring on board some form players from Man City. De Bruyne has delivered in every game he's started and Otamendi is the safest route into their defence. \n Ash \u00a0( @FPLHints ): The panel team has taken a battering of late. We may have been late to the party on De Bruyne and Otamendi but we hope they can improve our ranking of 1,467,902. \n Sam Bonfield \u00a0( @FPLFamily ): We've wanted to swap Fraser for De Bruyne for a few weeks but it wasn't possible because of budget. Having saved some money with previous transfers we can now capitalise on De Bruyne's form coming in to a nice run of fixtures. Otamendi offers an additional attacking threat, as shown by his 15-point haul last weekend. \n Neal Thurman \u00a0( @nealjthurman ): It's hard not to have De Bruyne in any Fantasy side at this point and moving on from Fraser, who has shockingly started on the bench in AFC Bournemouth's past two matches, is the obvious move. \n Ben McNair \u00a0( @drbenmcnair ): De Bruyne is in player-of-the-season form and Otamendi is a guaranteed starter, for at least a few weeks, in what has been statistically the best defence in the league for the past couple of seasons. \n Can you do better? \n Managers who want to take on the panel should enter the private classic league \" Beat the FPL Panel \". \n Join:  FPL Panel mini-league  (insert code: 3hdr4s) . \n Remember to select your Gameweek 7 team before Saturday's deadline of 11:30 BST \n",

        "summary": "Adrian Clarke reflects on how Man City head coach adopted three different formations to win at Old Trafford",
        "text": "\n Premier League managers spend much time plotting a match-winning strategy, but it does not always work. Adrian Clarke looks at five who changed their tactics mid-match to win the day. \n After analysing how  Ronald Koeman masterminded Everton's victory at West Bromwich Albion \u00a0this season, here Pep Guardiola's quick thinking earned an impressive victory over Manchester United. \n Guardiola's derby debut \n Pep Guardiola \u2019s penchant for flowing football is facilitated by a fluid approach to tactics, and this was evident during his first experience of the Manchester derby. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Kevin De Bruyne thrived against Man Utd under Pep Guardiola's Plan A\n             \n \n To ensure he claimed all  three points at Old Trafford  the Manchester City head coach cleverly changed tact twice during the second half. \n Early on his City side had performed quite beautifully in a 4-3-3/4-1-4-1 formation. They pressed high, stretched the pitch as wide as possible in possession, and used pockets of space between the lines for  Kevin De Bruyne  and  David Silva  to thrive. \n A 2-1 half-time lead did not reflect their superiority. \n Jose Mourinho  changed the Manchester United formation and brought on two substitutes at the interval, and within three minutes of the restart, a resurgent home side had created three chances on goal. The tide had seemingly turned. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Pep Guardiola (left) reacted quickly to his side falling behind to Jose Mourinho's side\n             \n \n Guardiola\u2019s reaction was almost instantaneous. \n Ditching the blueprint that had worked so well, defensive midfielder  Fernando  replaced striker  Kelechi Iheanacho  on 53 minutes, with Fernandinho pushing up, and the in-form De Bruyne asked to act as a \"false nine\" up front. \n Switching two of his best-performing players was a risky strategy, but the extra security in central midfield quickly stabilised the situation. \n Adopting a counter-attacking style in this shape, City soon wrestled back control, producing nine efforts on goal \u2013 and facing none \u2013 between the 71st and 88th minutes. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Guardiola explains his tactical tweak to (right to left) Leroy Sane, David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne at Old Trafford\n             \n \n Guardiola\u2019s tactical adjustment effectively shut down United\u2019s momentum, and increased his own side\u2019s potency. \n But for the woodwork, De Bruyne would have deservedly extended the lead in the 75th minute from one of many incisive breakaways. \n \n \n \n Shots \n Man Utd \n Man City \n \n \n \n \n 0-30 mins \n 3 \n 3 \n \n \n 30-60 mins \n 6 \n 4 \n \n \n 60-90 mins \n 3 \n 11 \n \n \n 90+ mins \n 2 \n 0 \n \n \n \n As the clocked ticked down, in response to the hosts\u2019 inclination to pump a series of high balls and crosses into their box, City\u2019s new head coach then asked his players to form a deep lying 5-4-1. \n Fernandinho  dropped back to be part of a three-man central defence, who soaked up late pressure with relative ease. \n Plan A had worked fabulously for Guardiola, but it was arguably his wisdom to switch to Plan B and then C that helped Man City claim victory. \n From a tactical perspective this was a wonderful managerial performance. \n See:  How Koeman's Plan B beat West Brom \n Tomorrow  How Wenger inspired Arsenal's fightback at AFC Bournemouth \n",

        "text": "\n Manchester City's quest for multiple trophies looks set to influence how managers approach the final nine Gameweeks of 2020/21  Fantasy Premier League . \n As Pep Guardiola's side battle for silverware on four fronts, rotation will become a huge factor in his team selections. \n This was evidenced in  Man City 's last Premier League match, when their manager made seven changes to his starting XI. \n Furthermore, the league leaders have only eight fixtures left, while they are among the four sides with a Blank Gameweek 33. \n The Scout\u2019s\u00a0 panel of experts  discuss the players they will turn to as replacements for City's star players. \n Ben McNair ( @ drbenmcnair ) \n I'll need to limit my Man City players to Ruben Dias (\u00a36.1m) and Kevin De Bruyne (\u00a311.9m), with heavy rotation and a Blank Gameweek 33 on the way. The motivation factor is a bit overestimated. I find a lot of gains can be made by sticking to the usual principles while others are taking end-of-season risks. \n Ben Crabtree\u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ) \n From a defensive point of view, Romain Saiss (\u00a34.9m), Jonny (\u00a35.4m) and Kieran Tierney (\u00a35.3m) look good options alongside a  Chelsea  defender or two. \n Attacking-wise, Jamie Vardy (\u00a310.1m), Kelechi Iheanacho (\u00a35.7m), Pedro Neto (\u00a35.7m), Alexandre Lacazette (\u00a38.2m) and Jack Grealish (\u00a37.5m) will be under consideration as players with good fixtures who don't have any blank Gameweeks. \n Lee Bonfield\u00a0( @FPLFamily ) \n The  Wolverhampton Wanderers  defence have some excellent fixtures after Gameweek 30. I'm looking at avoiding the Man City rotation with Conor Coady (\u00a34.8m). Clean sheets are looking like they might be on the cards, and he could also be a great option as a new-found attacking threat. \n Replacing the midfielders is slightly more challenging as City players have a great points ceiling in Fantasy. Having not travelled for international duty, Son Heung-min (\u00a39.4m) looks to be an essential pick as  Tottenham Hotspur  are now out of the UEFA Europa League and can now fully focus on the Premier League. \n I also think Ademola Lookman (\u00a35.1m) will be key to  Fulham 's fight to stay in the league and could therefore be a brilliant option to avoid rotation. \n Utkarsh Dalmia ( @zophar666 ) \n In defence, the likes of Luke Shaw (\u00a35.2m), Cesar Azpilicueta (\u00a35.8m) and Antonio Rudiger (\u00a34.6m) offer excellent alternatives to the Man City lads. \n In attack, Jesse Lingard (\u00a36.2m) is an excellent replacement for Ilkay Gundogan (\u00a36.3m). Son and Harry Kane (\u00a311.6m) are also great nailed-on options. \n Neal Thurman\u00a0( @nealjthurman ) \n Even in the era of big squads and rotation, there are line-up locks when healthy. Kane, Vardy, Grealish, Mohamed Salah (\u00a312.4m), Bukayo Saka (\u00a35.3m), Bruno Fernandes (\u00a311.5m), Marcus Rashford (\u00a39.5m), Stuart Dallas (\u00a35.1m), Azpilicueta and Aaron Cresswell (\u00a35.9m) to name a 3-5-2 formation of options. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 FPL experts' chip strategies: Kane a Triple Captain option Part 2:\u00a0 FPL experts' chip strategies: Target fixture swings Part 3:\u00a0 FPL experts' captain strategies: Golden Boot will inspire Salah Part 4:\u00a0 FPL experts\u2019 captain strategies: Vardy a differential Part 5:\u00a0 FPL experts\u2019 team strategies: Neto has fixtures to thrive Part 6:  FPL experts' team strategies: Pick Azpilicueta for more clean sheets \n",

I'll also be going heavy on  Manchester United  assets, but I'm unsure on  Chelsea , despite their favourable fixtures, as they are out of form.  Crystal Palace  look to be the best bet for budget-friendly players, as they've plenty to play for in the league and no cup distractions.  Vicente Guaita  (\u00a34.2m),  Aaron Wan-Bissaka  (\u00a34.5m),  Luka Milivojevic  (\u00a36.3m) and  Michy Batshuayi  (\u00a36.5m) are the players I am considering. \n Ash  ( @FPLHints ): It makes sense having sufficient cover from Man City and Man Utd. But be sure to also stock up on Chelsea as they play in the reduced Gameweek 33, so you're covering two bases on that front. \n Ben Crabtree \u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ): There is the potential for big ranking swings this week. I have nine players with two matches, without using a chip.  Sead Kolasinac  (\u00a35.0m) and  James Maddison  (\u00a36.8m) are my single-Gameweek players. \n Lee Bonfield  ( @FPL Family ): I'm absolutely mad for GW32! It's all-out Manchester as I'll be playing my Free Hit chip and tripling on City and United. The decision is where to go after that? Chelsea fixtures look nice, but they are out of form.  Wolverhampton Wanderers , maybe, but will they have one eye on the cup and rotate? I personally like the look of Crystal Palace for differentials and maybe one of the lesser-owned  Tottenham Hotspur  midfielders.  Dele Alli  (\u00a38.8m), at just 2.4 per cent ownership, looks appealing. \n Sam Bonfield  ( @FPL Family ):  Paul Pogba  (\u00a38.9m) and  Marcus Rashford  (\u00a37.6m) look great picks for Man Utd. I've tripled up with  Victor Lindelof  (\u00a35.1m), too. With the first match in their new stadium falling in Gameweek 32, Spurs players, especially  Harry Kane  (\u00a312.5m) and Alli, should be given serious thought. But don't neglect the in-form single Gameweekers like  Sadio Mane  (\u00a310.0m) as they could continue to score big points hauls. \n Who Got The Assist? \u00a0( @WGTA_FPL ): With one of their fixtures being against bottom-placed  Huddersfield Town , Crystal Palace are ripe for differentials.  Jeffrey Schlupp  (\u00a34.5m) and  Wilfried Zaha  (\u00a36.8m) could be worth the risk. \n Paul Gee \u00a0( @FPLPaulGee ): Man City and Man Utd coverage is essential for me. United are playing two teams who are both concentrating on the FA Cup. However, City have an FA Cup match three days after their second GW32 fixture and could rest some key players. \n See:\u00a0 Double Gameweek 32 essential FPL reading \n",

He's dropped 0.3 in price since the start of the season, yet his first-half strike means he has now produced attacking points in three of the last four Gameweeks. \n Rose returned to the first XI at the expense of  Ben Davies  (\u00a34.9m) as Spurs extended their unbeaten start. He has averaged 6.5 points per match - more than any defensive team-mate - yet is owned by just 5% of FPL managers. \n The recent move to 4-1-4-1 means that the fit-again  Eric Dier  (\u00a35.2m) was afforded a substitute appearance, with  Victor Wanyama  (\u00a35.0m) continuing as the holding midfielder. \n The second most-captained player in Gameweek 7, Aguero still carried a significant threat - he produced four of City's six shots inside the box. \n With  Kevin De Bruyne  (\u00a310.7m) still uncertain to be fit for the Gameweek 8 visit of Everton, Guardiola may look to recall  Ilkay Gundogan  (\u00a35.4m) or hand  Leroy Sane  (\u00a37.7m) a first start, with  Fernando  (\u00a34.8m) and  Jesus Navas '\u00a0(\u00a36.3m) minutes in question. \n Having struggled in the midweek UEFA Champions League draw against Celtic, Kolarov's unconvincing display at White Hart Lane could earn  Gael Clichy  (\u00a35.4m) a recall against the Toffees. \n",

This\u00a0could allow\u00a0all three midfielders to close the gap on Hazard and Sterling as the most in-demand options. \n As for who are on their way out, Leicester City\u2019s  Riyad Mahrez  (\u00a39.5m) and West Ham United\u2019s  Dimitri Payet  (\u00a39.4m) continue to be the men to make way, traded out of over 190,000 squads between them. \n In both cases, the decision to show them the door could prove premature. \n Mahrez has testing fixtures to come with trips to Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea in his next five Gameweeks. But a fit-again Payet could be about to flourish. \n Hammer time? \n The Hammers\u2019 midfielder will play four of his next six at the London Stadium. Watford, Southampton, Middlesbrough and Sunderland all pay visit as he looks to return to the form that produced nine goals and 13 assists in his debut Premier League season. \n Payet's team-mate,\u00a0 Michail Antonio  (\u00a37.0m), offers an intriguing alternative. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Michail Antonio's two goals this season cannot be ignored\n             \n \n The new member of the England squad\u00a0is set to be unshackled from his role at right-back. Antonio has scored twice\u00a0over the first three Gameweeks and, like Payet, fired in an attempt every 39 minutes in the 2015/16 campaign, on his way to eight goals\u00a0in 26 appearances. \n Coutinho and Redmond falling \n Elsewhere, the popularity of Liverpool's  Philppe Coutinho \u00a0(\u00a38.2m)\u00a0has stalled.\u00a0 \n The Brazilian has suffered\u00a0a small loss of just under 8,000 in aggregate ownership. This decline,\u00a0a result of back-to-back blanks and the emergence of Hazard and Sterling,\u00a0is still a far cry from the huge growth he enjoyed\u00a0in the opening two Gameweeks.\u00a0 \n Another early-season target, Southampton\u2019s  Nathan Redmond  (\u00a36.1m), has lost over 34,000 owners heading into Gameweek 4, with trips to Arsenal, West Ham and Leicester beckoning. \n The Swansea City midfielder,\u00a0 Leroy Fer  (\u00a35.2m), has been heading in the opposite direction to Redmond, attracting more than\u00a075,000 new owners ahead of\u00a0Gameweek 4. \u00a0 \n But, like Redmond, Fer\u00a0is about to endure a testing schedule, with home ties against\u00a0Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool over the next four Gameweeks. \n \u00a0 \n",

Fabianski has been placed in the top three for saves in each of the past three seasons and leads the way again with 24. \n Antonio Valencia (MUN) \u00a36.5m \n The right-back's goal against  Everton  was only his second over the past four seasons and helped him top the overall defender standings on 36 points. Only  Nemanja Matic  (\u00a35.0m) has made more passes into the final third (43 to 52) than Valencia for Man Utd, with  Henrikh Mkhitaryan  (\u00a38.5m) the only player to supply more crosses (25 to 26). \n Nicolas Otamendi (MCI) \u00a35.6m \n The centre-back got off the mark for the season with a goal in the 6-0 win at  Watford . With seven shots from five outings, he has upped his goal threat considerably. Otamendi has recorded a shot every 61.6 minutes in this campaign, compared with 172.8 in 30 appearances in 2016/17. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Kyle Walker (MCI) \u00a36.5m \n Last term's top-ranked defender for assists (six) while at  Tottenham Hotspur  claimed a second of the season for his new club. The right-back also made nine clearances, blocks and interceptions (CBI) and recovered the ball six times to top score for defenders in the  Bonus Points System  (BPS) on 38. \n Steven Davis (SOU) \u00a35.0m \n Without a goal or a Dream Team call-up in 2016/17, the  Southampton  midfielder earns both by Gameweek 5 this season courtesy of his strike at  Crystal Palace . \n Matt Ritchie (NEW) \u00a35.9m \n The winger earned a third assist from a corner as  Jamaal Lascelles  (\u00a34.6m) converted his cross for a second successive Gameweek. Ritchie already has four assists, half of his tally of eight achieved in his last Premier League season in 2015/16. \n David Silva (MCI) \u00a38.3m \n A brace of assists took him to four for the season and earned the playmaker early recognition, having made only a single Dream Team appearance last season. Silva has created a chance every 25.7 minutes, compared with 33.7 in 2016/17. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Andrew Surman (BOU) \u00a34.5m \n The midfielder earns a rare Dream Team call-up, having struck his first FPL goal since 2011/12 in Friday's victory over  Brighton & Hove Albion . \n Scott Arfield (BUR) \u00a34.9m \n Recalled to the starting line-up for the trip to  Liverpool , Arfield opened the scoring with his second shot of the season to match last season's goal tally for the Clarets. \n Sergio Aguero (MCI) \u00a311.6m \n His 20 points at Vicarage Road is the biggest single total by any player this season. Aguero has converted 29.4% of his shots into goals. That is double last season's rate of 14.4% and well above his best in the Premier League (20.2%) achieved in 2015/16. \n Romelu Lukaku (MUN) \u00a311.7m \n The Belgian earns a second Dream Team appearance of the season following his late show in the 4-0 win over Everton. Lukaku has now scored in four of the five Gameweeks and has been presented with nine big chances, three more than any other FPL forward. \n See:  Man City top the bonus in Gameweek 5 \n",

Listed as a midfielder in FPL, the Frenchman is set to continue as a centre-forward for the visit of  Crystal Palace . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The two players making way are  Callum Wilson  (\u00a37.9m) and  Ayoze Perez  (\u00a36.4m), who have both dropped in price. \n Favourable opening matches against promoted teams persuaded the experts to triple up on AFC Bournemouth's attack. \n But while  Ryan Fraser  (\u00a37.4m) and  Joshua King  (\u00a36.5m) have kept their places for now, the Cherries have so far failed to live up to expectations and are now at home to  Manchester City . \n Perez has suffered back-to-back blanks since signing for\u00a0 Leicester City . A trip to\u00a0 Sheffield United \u00a0this weekend was not enough to persuade the experts to keep the Spaniard. \n Captain Sterling \n Raheem Sterling  (\u00a312.2m) is selected as the experts' captain for Gameweek 3, while  Mohamed Salah  (\u00a312.5m) is given the vice-captaincy as  Liverpool  welcome  Arsenal  to Anfield.\u00a0 \n The experts have \u00a30.3m in the bank for future transfer dealings for their team, which ranks 530,217 after the first two Gameweeks.\u00a0 \n What the experts say \n Holly Shand  ( @FFCommunity_ ): Perez has created very few chances and his attempts on goal have been limited, so a move to Martial makes sense. He has two goals in two matches, is playing out of position as the main striker, and has great fixtures! \n Ben McNair  ( @drbenmcnair ): Pukki ticks all of the boxes for a season keeper. He's cheap and is shooting a lot. Wilson took only two shots against a couple of promoted teams and it's time for him to make way. \n Sam Bonfield  ( @FPLFamily ): In pre-season, Perez looked like he was going to play alongside  Jamie Vardy  (\u00a38.9m) but he is now operating more on the wing and is less effective to us FPL managers. \n Lee Bonfield  ( @FPLFamily ): At the start of every season we look for value players and try to bring them in before their price increases. The moves to Martial and Pukki are two such examples. \n Chuck Booth  ( @ChuckBoothSport ): We've reached the point where the Pukki party is impossible to ignore. The decision to bring in Martial is an easy one. Man Utd's attack is looking like the real deal this season. \n Neal Thurman  ( @nealjthurman ): Wilson will likely finish the season better than Pukki but this move is all about freeing up funds for other things. Pukki is the right move with Martial the first in what will be a series of upgrades we make with those funds. \n Can you do better? \n Managers who want to take on the panel should enter the private classic league \" Beat the FPL Panel \". \n The code to join is:  3hdr4s \n Remember to register your team before Friday's Gameweek 3 deadline at 19:00 BST. \n",

        "text": "\n Having lost only one of their last 22 Premier League matches, scoring 54 goals and conceding only 10 in that time,  Manchester City  stars have provided the foundation for many  Fantasy Premier League  managers' success over recent months. \n But given the growing fear of \"Pep roulette\", expert Gianni Buttice believes managers should perhaps avoid premium players like Kevin De Bruyne (\u00a311.9m) and favour cheaper options such as Ilkay Gundogan (\u00a36.1m). \n \"Pep roulette is a lot easier when you're looking at lower-priced assets, because if they miss out, it's not a lot of money on your bench,\" says Buttice on the latest  FPL Show .\u00a0 \n \"For me, De Bruyne is slightly too expensive to be sitting on your bench.\" \n \"Because of his [Gundogan's] price point, I'm happy to hold him.\" \n Dias the go-to defender \n As for the City backline, Phillips says Ruben Dias (\u00a36.1m), who has started 27 of Man City's last 28 matches since making his debut in Gameweek 4, is the standout choice. \n \"With Dias, you have the security of starts. I think he is the one to pick,\" he says. \n Remember, the deadline for Gameweek 30 is 11:00 BST on Saturday 3 April. \n See:  Watch the latest FPL Show in full \n",

Sterling\u2019s deflected shot won it in dramatic fashion. \n Chelsea 0-1 Man City, 30 Sep \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Kevin De Bruyne 's stunning goal against Chelsea, his former club and the defending champions, put Man City top for the first time, above\u00a0Man Utd on goal difference. \n Despite the absence of  Sergio Aguero , City dominated at Stamford Bridge and victory concluded a flawless month in which they won all four matches without conceding. \n Man City 7-2 Stoke, 14 Oct \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Guardiola called it the finest display he has seen since becoming City's head coach as his side took apart Stoke at the Etihad Stadium to move two points clear. \n Fernandinho 's 30-yard effort was spectacular but Leroy Sane and Gabriel Jesus also scored after brilliant De Bruyne assists as Man City scored five goals or more for the third consecutive home match. \n Man Utd 1-2 Man City, 10 Dec \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n History was made as Man City became the first team to win 14 successive PL matches in a season, equalling the record of  Arsenal , who did it across two campaigns in 2002. \n Nicolas Otamendi  netted the decisive goal at Old Trafford to send City 11 points clear.\u00a0 \n Man City 5-1 Leicester, 10 Feb \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Aguero scored four times in the second half as  Leicester City \u00a0were dispatched at the Etihad Stadium. De Bruyne also starred with three assists, the first of which arrived after just two minutes and five seconds. \n The win sent Man City 16 points clear, the largest lead since Man Utd in April 2013, coincidentally over City themselves. \n",

He built that in the club\u2026 and that is the standard that you must face if you want to play for Manchester United or work for Manchester United. \n \u201cFirst of all, he knew when to rebuild and reconstruct a new team because he did it over two decades and every time he was successful. He did it with a balance of homegrown players and bringing big stars in. \n \u201cHe got the best out of it, like working with  Eric Cantona , working with  [Ruud] van Nistelrooy ,  [Robin] van Persie ,  Wayne Rooney . \n \u201cThat is huge if you are able to handle those personalities, but also to let them play as a team. That was always one of his most important qualities - that the team is always above any individual. It's difficult to construct one winning team. He did it so many times!\u201d \n See:  Ferguson: My expectation was always to win \n Ten Hag has benefited from Ferguson\u2019s insight and experience as the Dutchman targets another era of success at Old Trafford. \n \u201cHis experience is huge, so with all the knowledge he can help you with, he can,\u201d says Ten Hag. \n \u201cI'm really pleased that he wants to share his knowledge with me.
