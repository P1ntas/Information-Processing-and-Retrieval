        "text": "\n It is all change at  Arsenal , with  Unai Emery  departing and  Freddie Ljungberg  taking charge as interim head coach. \n And owners of\u00a0 Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang \u00a0(\u00a310.9m) in  Fantasy Premier League \u00a0will also be hoping for a change in form from the\u00a0Gabon international. \n Aubameyang\u00a0was one of FPL's most reliable performers in the opening matches of 2019/20. \n He produced attacking returns in each of the first seven Gameweeks, totalling seven goals and one assist. \n But, since then, he has only one goal and one assist in six Premier League appearances. \n Watch Aubameyang's Arsenal goals \n \n Despite his lack of recent returns, Aubameyang is the joint-fifth highest-scoring player in FPL and remains a popular pick, sitting in 23.0 per cent of squads. \n His short-term schedule certainly offers hope he can rediscover his best form, under Ljungberg or a permanent head coach. \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), Arsenal's next three matches all score just two. \n They travel to  Norwich City  and  West Ham United , with a home match against  Brighton & Hove Albion \u00a0in between on Thursday evening. \n In-form strike partner \n Alexandre Lacazette  (\u00a39.3m) will look to continue his form with Ljungberg in charge. \n The Frenchman has two goals and two assists in the last four Gameweeks, including a 12-point haul against  Southampton  last weekend. \n Midfield pair  Mesut Ozil  (\u00a37.2m) and  Nicolas Pepe  (\u00a39.2m) should also be monitored. \n Ozil has created eight chances over the last three Gameweeks since returning to the starting XI, double the total of any team-mate. \n And Pepe is expected to reclaim a place, having been named on the bench for the last three Premier League matches. \n The Ivorian's 16 chances created rank top for the Gunners this term, while his 27 shots are second only to the 34 of Aubameyang. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:\u00a0 GW14 final call: Abraham injury forces rethink \n",

        "summary": "Wolves forward has scored in three successive matches and earns a place in GW14 line-up captained by Jamie Vardy",
        "text": "\n Having scored in each of the last three Gameweeks,  Raul Jimenez  (\u00a37.5m) has been a top target for  Fantasy Premier League  managers. \n The Mexican is the second most-bought forward in the Gameweek, earning more than 175,000 new owners for his home match with  Sheffield United . \n His underlying statistics show why the  Wolverhampton Wanderers  striker has been a big success recently. \n Jimenez's totals of 22 shots and 16 shots inside the penalty area over the last four Gameweeks are both more than any other player in FPL. \n He takes his place in a Scout Selection that lines up in a 3-4-3 formation, with  Jamie Vardy  (\u00a39.7m) handed the armband and  Sadio Mane  (\u00a312.2m) given the vice-captaincy. \n Nick Pope (BUR) \u00a34.7m \n A visit from  Crystal Palace  hands the  Burnley  No 1 the chance to extend his terrific form at Turf Moor. At home, Pope's total of four clean sheets is more than any other goalkeeper in FPL. \n Serge Aurier (TOT) \u00a34.9m \n The  Tottenham Hotspur  defender has stepped up his attacking threat ahead of a home encounter with  AFC Bournemouth . Aurier has one goal and two assists in his first two matches under  Jose Mourinho  across all competitions. \n Trent Alexander-Arnold (LIV) \u00a37.2m \n The  Liverpool  defender entertains  Brighton & Hove Albion  on the back of some impressive creative displays. At home, Alexander-Arnold's 30 key passes rank second among all players in FPL. \n Ben Chilwell (LEI) \u00a35.8m \n Leicester City 's left-back looks a strong all-round prospect at home to  Everton . Chilwell has one goal, two assists and four clean sheets in the last four Gameweeks. \n Sadio Mane (LIV) \u00a312.2m \n FPL's top-scoring midfielder has found the net in each of the last three Gameweeks. Mane has averaged 8.4 points per home start for Liverpool this term. \n Son Heung-Min (TOT) \u00a39.7m \n The South Korean was Spurs' top FPL performer in their first match under Mourinho, totalling 13 points against West Ham. That has earned him 245,000+ transfers in, more than any other midfielder in Gameweek 14. \n Anthony Martial (MUN) \u00a37.8m \n The  Manchester United  attacker has averaged 7.3 points per home start in 2019/20. Martial hosts an  Aston Villa  side who have conceded a league-leading 94 shots inside the box in away matches. \n Christian Pulisic (CHE) \u00a37.5m \n The  Chelsea  winger can extend his recent scoring run at home to  West Ham United . Pulisic has six goals in his last seven matches across all competitions for the Blues. \n Jamie Vardy (LEI) \u00a39.7m \n The top-scoring player in FPL, he has five double-digit hauls in his 13 appearances. Vardy has five goals in his last six meetings with the Toffees. \n Danny Ings (SOU) \u00a36.1m \n One of the most consistent forwards in FPL, he has scored in five of the last seven Gameweeks. Ings entertains a  Watford  side who have lost three of their last four in all competitions. \n Raul Jimenez (WOL) \u00a37.5m \n The Wolves striker extended his recent form with a goal and two assists against Braga in the UEFA Europa League in midweek. \n What the experts say \n Holly Shand \u00a0( @FFCommunity_ ): Pope has been in fine form for me, I hope he can continue to deliver. Surely attacking returns and clean sheets are well due for Trent now? He's been tough to hold with  Andrew Robertson  (\u00a37.0m) shining on the opposite flank. \n Ash  ( @FPLHints ): I can't argue with that front seven for Gameweek 14. I particularly like the Ings pick; with his low ownership and healthy points per million he's the best budget striker available. \n Paul Gee  ( @FPLPaulGee ): The Pulisic and Son combo could prove fruitful this week. I would worry about rotation in the weeks to come. Pope has been a good points scorer for me and is a great pick. \n Mark McGettigan  ( @FPLGeneral ): Top picks this week. I would have liked to have seen  Marcus Rashford  (\u00a38.6m) in there but Martial is a nice alternative. Aurier has caught the eye in Mourinho's first two fixtures, he's on my radar. \n Sam Bonfield \u00a0( @FPLFamily ): All aboard the Spurs train! Aurier looks a good pick this week, he was fantastic in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday - more movement and better attacking play which will likely lead to Bonus Points if he gets any attacking or defensive returns. With uncertainty surrounding  Tammy Abraham \u00a0(\u00a38.0m) I really like the Pulisic pick, too, he's the one I would really like to own this week. \n Neal Thurman  ( @nealjthurman ): Even with Unai Emery out, I can't escape the notion that\u00a0 Norwich City  are going to score at least two against  Arsenal . I want  Teemu Pukki  (\u00a36.6m) in my team and I'll do it at the expense of Ings, who doesn't get to play the Gunners again this week. \n Ben Crabtree \u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ): There are great fixtures for a lot of players this week. lt'll be a high-scoring Gameweek and this team have a lot of bases covered. \n",

A local Thai woman was subsequently apprehended. \n These raids were undertaken by Thailand\u2019s Department of Special Investigation and assisted by the Premier League. One of the Britons arrested skipped bail and a warrant has been issued for his arrest, as well as for multiple other suspects. \n The various charges pursued by the public prosecutor included: copyright infringement, interception of data, operating as an unlicensed broadcaster and operating an unlawful business. \n 'Stark warning' \n \"This is one of the most substantial compensations for piracy-related crimes in Thailand and is a stark warning to anyone involved in the illegal supply of Premier League streams,\" Premier League Director of Legal Services Kevin Plumb said.\u00a0 \n \"Attitudes towards, and acceptance of, these types of operators in Asia is changing, which is good news for fans who watch Premier League content through legitimate channels. \n \"Those who don\u2019t should be aware that subscribing to services run by organised crime gangs means they risk, not just the content disappearing when the service gets disrupted by legal action, but also exposing themselves to the threat of fraud and malware. \n \"We are committed to pursuing all those involved in providing illegal access to our content and are grateful to the Courts and the public prosecutor for acknowledging and supporting the importance of fighting piracy. \n 'Damage to local economies' \n Thailand\u2019s Department of Special Investigation is one of the leading anti-piracy forces we work with and we thank them and the public prosecutor for their support in prosecuting this case.\" \n Police Colonel Paisit Wongmuang, Director-General of Department of Special Investigation said: \"Executives at the Ministry of Justice place importance on the Digital Economy Promotion Policy, especially for the suppression of copyright infringement on digital platforms - it causes serious damage to the economies of Thailand and foreign countries. \n \"For this case, the DSI accepted it as a special case in 2015. On 11 May 2017, the DSI\u2019s Technology and Cyber Crime Bureau conducted a raid action at 5 different locations and consequently arrested two British nationals and a Thai national for further investigation. \n \"After the investigation was completed, the three arrested individuals were transferred to the public prosecutor for prosecution until the Court granted its decision. \n \"The DSI has been investigating many copyright infringement cases where Thailand has been used as the base with advanced technology being implemented as a tool to commit the crime.\" \n \n \n \"Piracy is not a victimless crime\" \n \n Sompan Charumilinda, True Visions \n \n \n \n True Visions Executive Vice Chairman, Sompan Charumilinda, spoke to the bigger picture of piracy in Thailand, adding, \"Piracy is not a victimless crime, as the crime syndicates that run these operations do great damage to Thailand\u2019s economy and reputation, and even target end users through spyware and malware. \n \"Thai people are talented and have great potential to contribute to the creative economy and compete on a global level, but their efforts need to be supported by strong intellectual property protections. \n \"On this front, we would like to thank the Department of Special Investigations for their continued support. We are happy to join forces with the English Premier League and all stakeholders to continue the fight against piracy, in hopes of building a brighter future for the creative economy and the entire nation.\" \n The Premier League operates a comprehensive copyright protection programme and will investigate and pursue suppliers of illegal streaming services. The League\u2019s office in Singapore provides a base for the Asia-Pacific region to support broadcast partners and to fight piracy of Premier League content. \n If you know or suspect a website is showing Premier League matches illegally or someone that is supplying illicit streaming devices then you can report this directly to  illegalstreaming@premierleague.com . \n",

He\u00a0will retain the captain\u2019s armband for\u00a0 Leicester City 's home fixture against\u00a0 Everton . \n The Foxes forward has a fine record against the Toffees, scoring in three of their last four meetings.\u00a0 \n Sadio Mane  (\u00a312.2m) is the team\u2019s vice-captain at home against\u00a0 Brighton & Hove Albion . \n The\u00a0 Liverpool  winger has produced attacking returns in five of his last six matches. He has averaged 8.4 points per start at Anfield this term.\u00a0 \n Wait on Tammy \n There are concerns over  Tammy Abraham  (\u00a38.0m), who went off injured in\u00a0 Chelsea 's 2-2 draw with Valencia in the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday evening.\u00a0 \n Post-match comments suggested Abraham is not badly hurt, but FPL managers must wait for an update on his fitness in  Frank Lampard \u2019s press conference on Friday afternoon. \n The experts may be forced into a late swap should Abraham be ruled out. \n Elsewhere in their team,  Raul Jimenez  (\u00a37.5m) has scored in three successive Gameweeks ahead of\u00a0 Wolverhampton Wanderers ' home match against\u00a0 Sheffield United . \n And, in defence,\u00a0 Caglar Soyuncu  (\u00a35.0m) seeks a fifth straight clean sheet for in-form Leicester. His Gameweek 14 opponents Everton have failed to score in three of their six away matches this season. \n What the experts say \n Holly Shand  ( @FFCommunity_ ): A big green arrow last week, plus excellent fixtures and depth on the bench means that banking the free transfer looks wise. With the Gameweeks coming thick and fast, flexibility is key! \n Sam Bonfield  ( @FPLFamily ): The team looks nicely positioned this week so the plan to roll a transfer ahead of the heavy fixture congestion seems wise. But it would be amiss not to keep an eye on Abraham's injury. If it is more long-term than it currently appears then we may be forced to make a change. \n Ben McNair \u00a0( @drbenmcnair ): There are doubts over starts for a couple of our first XI but, with a strong bench, we should be able to field 11 players. Saving a free transfer will give us flexibility to get just about any player without a hit next week. A late change of plan may be called for should Abraham be ruled out for more than a couple of weeks. \n Can you do better? \n Managers who want to take on the panel should enter the private classic league \" Beat the FPL Panel \". \n Join:  FPL Panel mini-league  (insert code: 3hdr4s). \n Remember to select your Gameweek 14 team before Saturday\u2019s deadline of 11:30 GMT. \n",

        "text": "\n After claiming his fifth double-figure haul of 2019/20  Fantasy Premier League  last weekend,  Jamie Vardy  (\u00a39.7m) looks well-placed to continue as the most-selected captain in Gameweek 14. \n The  Leicester City  striker welcomes  Everton  to King Power Stadium on the back of seven goals and three assists in the last five Gameweeks. \n That output has earned Vardy over 235,000 transfers in, more than any other player in the Gameweek. \n The Foxes\u2019 forward has averaged 8.7 points per match (ppm) at home this season. \n Reds duo to shine? \n Liverpool  wingers  Sadio Mane \u00a0and  Mohamed Salah  (both \u00a312.2m) could be his main challengers. \n Mane has been the Reds\u2019 form attacker ahead of their home meeting with  Brighton & Hove Albion , having found the net in each of the last three Gameweeks. \n Interestingly, he has scored 22 of his last 30 Premier League goals at Anfield. \n \n \n \n When named in the starting XI, Mane has averaged 8.4ppm at home this term. \n Having recovered from an ankle problem, Salah returned to action in the UEFA Champions League in midweek. \n The Egyptian has scored all six of his goals at Anfield in 2019/20, averaging 8.8ppm. \n At home, his total of 13 shots on target is more than any other player in FPL. \n Midfield rival \n Christian Pulisic  (\u00a37.5m) provides another in-form alternative for  Chelsea \u2019s home fixture against\u00a0 West Ham United . \n The Blues\u2019 winger has scored all five of his goals for the season in the last four Gameweeks. \n He was also on the scoresheet in their midweek UEFA Champions League trip to Valencia. \n Pulisic looks set to boast the main goal threat for  Frank Lampard \u2019s side, with  Tammy Abraham  (\u00a38.0m) a big doubt after sustaining a hip problem on Wednesday evening. \n What the experts say \n Holly Shand  ( @FFCommunity_ ): It\u2019s another tough call between Vardy and Mane.  Vardy  didn\u2019t have a game in midweek, has the better form and is on penalties too, so he gets the nod. \n Tom  ( @WGTA_FPL ): Both Vardy and Mane are in form but  Vardy  edges it as he is on penalties. \n Sam Bonfield  ( @FPLFamily ): For the last two Gameweeks,  Vardy  has been an excellent captain for me and, in a nice fixture against an Everton side who are struggling all over the pitch, he seems certain to return. \n Neal Thurman \u00a0( @nealjthurman ): I\u2019m all-in on high-scoring  Tottenham Hotspur  and  Harry Kane  (\u00a310.8m) has my vote at home against  AFC Bournemouth . If I were really throwing caution to the wind, I\u2019d go for  Teemu Pukki  (\u00a36.6m) against an  Arsenal \u00a0defence who have been very vulnerable on the road. \n Ben McNair  ( @drbenmcnair ) :  I\u2019m tempted to just keep plugging away with  Raheem Sterling  (\u00a312.0m). With  Sergio Aguero  (\u00a311.9m) injured, he looks very likely to start against a  Newcastle United  side whose performances have been awful, despite some unlikely results. Vardy looks a good option too but, if Everton sit deep at the King Power Stadium, it may be the Leicester midfielders who are more likely to score. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  GW14 Captains: Kane to keep scoring \n",

The fact Spurs have struggled defensively this season means he may still be available in your average eight-team league. If not, I might be inclined to take a risk on  Reece James  getting another start for  Chelsea  against West Ham. \n MID: Todd Cantwell (NOR) \n I'd love to push\u00a0 Sheffield United 's\u00a0 John Fleck  after his 13-point haul but that feels very much like an anomaly. I am, however, interested in Cantwell's return to form on the back of his goal against  Everton  last time out. The  Norwich City  midfielder now has a home match against an  Arsenal  side that are struggling to keep goals out. I'd also be looking at another Canaries midfielder,\u00a0 Onel Hernandez , for the same reason if Cantwell fails to recover from a minor knock. \n FOR: Lys Mousset (SHU) \n As usual, there aren't a lot of forward options available in eight-team leagues. But Mousset may still be up for grabs and should be the priority as it looks like he'll recover from the minor injury he suffered last weekend. If he's not available then  Ashley Barnes  is worth considering after ending his scoring drought with two goals in the last two Gameweeks.  Michy Batshuayi  is another to target if  Tammy Abraham  is ruled out for Chelsea with a hip problem. \n",

Whichever full-back is selected will face a player willing to run at them every time he gets the ball. \n In his last home appearance, during a 2-0 defeat to  Watford , left winger Hernandez was relentless in his determination to take the ball past defenders. \n Completing seven of 13 attempted dribbles, the Cuba international posed a constant threat. \n Over half of his 54 touches were inside the final 18 yards of the pitch, so it will be essential for Arsenal's defenders to stay on their feet and avoid making rash tackles. \n Menacing on the break\u00a0 \n With  Christoph Zimmermann  back from injury and partnering  Ben Godfrey  in central defence, the Canaries soaked up pressure superbly in last Saturday's 2-0 victory at  Everton . \n Buoyed by that resilient display, Farke is set to try and repeat the trick against the Gunners, with a focus on exploiting gaps on the break. \n In that respect Hernandez will be a tremendous asset. \n He scored from a turnover breakaway against  Manchester United  in late October. \n And last weekend he made a devastating surge on the counter, powering through the middle to test  Jordan Pickford  in a 1v1. \n Winger by numbers\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Onel Hernandez \n Per 90 \n Norwich rank \n \n \n \n \n Dribbles attempted \n 9.42 \n 1 \n \n \n Dribbles completed \n 3.92 \n 1 \n \n \n Touches in opp. box \n 7.06 \n 1 \n \n \n Open play crosses \n 3.4 \n 1 \n \n \n Passes in opp. box \n 3.4 \n 2 \n \n \n Shots \n 1.57 \n 2 \n \n \n \n * Min 2 starts \n Hernandez likes to stay wide to torment full-backs, but will occasionally make telling direct central runs. \n Arsenal, who followed last weekend's 2-2 home draw with  Southampton \u00a0with a 2-1 UEFA Europa League defeat by Frankfurt on Thursday night and promptly relieved Emery of his duties, must ensure they combat this threat. \n Confidence is such a vital ingredient to the way Norwich play their football under head coach Farke. \n Urged to pass the ball out from the back and to receive it in tight areas all over the pitch, they function best when everyone is feeling on top of their game. \n Confidence the key \n A sequence of poor results appeared to damage that belief. \n Until last weekend, the Canaries' players were taking extra touches, rushing their decision-making and showing for the ball less often. \n The impressive victory at Goodison Park could mark a turnaround for a side that has seemed to be benefit greatly from the return of Hernandez and Zimmermann. \n If Norwich can perform with as much zest and assurance as they did on Merseyside, they could give Gunners\u00a0interim head coach  Freddie Ljungberg \u00a0a baptism of fire. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 Iwobi can reinvigorate Everton midfield Part 3:\u00a0 Jesus has attributes to take leading role \n",

        "text": "\n With registrations now open for 2019/20  ePremier League , we spoke with players who shone last season to find out what it was like to play in the competition, as well as getting their tips for success. \n Luke Carpenter \n Although Luke hails from\u00a0Great Yarmouth, his family connections led to him choosing  Watford  as his club. He defeated the No 1 seed in the semi-final of the club playoffs on the way to qualifying for the\u00a0Xbox Grand Final in London. \n How important is it for you to represent your club? \n It was a massive honour due to a lot of my family being from there, including my grandfather who sadly passed away. \n How did you become an ePL finalist? \n I first saw the ePL advertised on Twitter and took part in the qualifying process which I did OK in. I was then lucky enough to have my friend drive me to the club playoffs where I played very well to book my place at the ePL Finals. \n How has success in the ePL helped you progress into the professional scene? \n The ePL helped me a lot in terms of increasing my exposure and growing my EA SPORTS FIFA YouTube channel. My first match was also broadcast live on Sky Sports which meant I was seen winning by thousands of people which did a lot for me in terms of support but also confidence in my FIFA ability. \n What did it feel like to qualify for the club playoffs? \n It was one of, if not the best, moment of my life. It didn't hit me straight away but I soon realised what a big accomplishment it was and couldn't stop smiling and celebrating with my friend. Knowing all the hard work I put in, then the qualifying process leading up to the club playoffs and then the journey up to Watford from Great Yarmouth all paid off in the best possible way. \n What was it like representing Watford in the finals? \n It was brilliant to be able to represent the club that means a lot to me and my family. The amount of support and messages I received from Watford fans and the hospitality laid out by the club at the playoffs and the ePL Finals was incredible. \n Top three tips for anyone new to the ePL? \n 1. Enjoy the experience as it only comes around once a year and it's a brilliant chance to represent your club 2. It gives everyone a chance to play competitively, even if you're not verified on Ultimate Team 3. It can be a massive stepping stone for somebody trying to make their way in the competitive FIFA scene \n What advice would you give amateurs for setting up their team for playing online? \n I find that watching YouTube tutorials/squad builders are brilliant for helping you get your team started and also working out what are the best tactics to use. \n What formation and tactics work best for you when playing online? \n This year I've found that either a 4-4-2 or 4-2-2-2 works best because I always attack better with two strikers as I like to move the ball forward as quickly as possible. \n Which three FIFA Ultimate Team players are must-haves for this season's ePL competition? \n N'Golo Kante ,  Virgil van Dijk  and  Mohamed Salah . \n See:\u00a0 Register at e.premierleague.com \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout is tipping five players to produce big points in Gameweek 14 of  Fantasy Premier League . \n Danny Ings (SOU) \u00a36.0m \n The  Southampton  forward has been one of FPL's most consistent performers over the last few matches. \n Ings has scored in five of the last seven Gameweeks, netting against  Tottenham Hotspur ,  Chelsea ,  Wolverhampton Wanderers ,  Everton  and  Arsenal . \n Indeed, over that period from Gameweek 7 onwards, his tally is second only to the nine goals of  Jamie Vardy  (\u00a39.7m) among all players in FPL. \n Watch Ings' strike at Arsenal \n \n When assessed against his early-season displays, the underlying statistics clearly show Ings's improvement. \n Over Gameweeks 1 to 6, he managed just six shots inside the box and two shots on target. \n But in his subsequent seven matches, he produced 14 shots in the box and eight shots on target. \n Major contributor \n Ings's opener at Arsenal on Saturday means he now has six goals and an assist this season. \n Indeed, when selected, he has been involved in 70 per cent of Southampton's goals. \n That highlights his importance to  Ralph Hasenhuttl 's side as they embark on a very favourable run of opponents. \n Hope against Hornets\u00a0 \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), four of Saints' next five matches score only two. \n That spell starts with a crucial Gameweek 14 home encounter with\u00a0 Watford . \n The Hornets lie at the bottom of the table ahead of their visit to St Mary's Stadium, one point behind Southampton. \n And they have lost three of their last four matches in all competitions. \n Ings has the eye for goal to be decisive this weekend and help Saints take advantage of their kind run of festive fixtures. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  GW14 Ones to watch: Andrew Robertson Part 3:  GW14 Ones to watch: Ben Chilwell Part 4:  GW14 Ones to watch: Dele Alli Part 5:  GW14 Ones to watch: Gabriel Jesus \n",

They are ranked 18,820th out of 46,491 teams in the \" Beat the FPL Panel \" mini-league. \n Top for the third successive Gameweek, Australian Hutomo Murray extended his lead to 19 points as his team,  black 10 , rose one place to 14th overall. \n Hutomo didn\u2019t enjoy the same transfer success as the experts with his two new picks,\u00a0 Dejan Lovren  (\u00a35.3m) and  Calum Chambers  (\u00a34.4m), combining for just three points. \n But, like the experts, he was rewarded for owning an Aston Villa player, with\u00a0 Anwar El Ghazi  (\u00a35.5m) scoring against Newcastle. \n Managers who want to take on the panel should enter the private classic league: \" Beat the FPL Panel \". \n Join:  FPL Panel mini-league  (insert code:  3hdr4s ). \n Remember to select your Gameweek 14 team before 11:30 GMT on Saturday 30 November. \n",

        "text": "\n Managers in  Fantasy Premier League  have been quick to react to  Son Heung-min 's (\u00a39.7m) Gameweek 13 performance. \n Son was the top FPL performer in  Jose Mourinho 's first match as  Tottenham Hotspur \u00a0head coach. He scored the opener and got an assist in a 3-2 win over  West Ham United . \n Son's 13 point-haul has made him the most-bought player in the Gameweek. The midfielder has earned more than 130,000 new owners ahead of a Gameweek 14 home encounter with  AFC Bournemouth . \n It also continued a series of consistent displays, with the South Korean producing attacking returns in each of the last four Gameweeks. \n \n Mourinho's immediate impact at Spurs suggests it is not only Son who can benefit. \n The north Londoners had lacked a cutting edge prior to his arrival, scoring just four goals in their final five Gameweeks under  Mauricio Pochettino . \n But  Harry Kane  (\u00a310.8m) returned to form on Saturday, scoring for only the second match since Gameweek 7. \n And  Lucas Moura  (\u00a37.0m) benefited from a recall to the starting XI. \n The Brazilian netted the second goal against West Ham to claim his first attacking returns since Gameweek 2.\u00a0 \n At the back, the attacking potential of  Serge Aurier  (\u00a34.8m) was again in evidence. The Ivorian supplied his third assist of the campaign to return six points. \n Good time to bring in \n Saturday's win was Spurs' first away from home since January, and that can buoy their players ahead of\u00a0favourable run of opponents. \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), five of their next eight matches score only two. \n That points to more success for Mourinho\u2019s key players over the festive period. \n Spurs' next eight Gameweeks \n \n \n \n GW \n Opp \n FDR \n GW \n Opp\u00a0 \n FDR \n \n \n \n \n 14 \n BOU (H) \n 2 \n 18 \n CHE (H) \n 4 \n \n \n 15 \n MUN (A) \n 4 \n 19 \n BHA (H) \n 2 \n \n \n 16 \n BUR (H) \n 2 \n 20 \n NOR (A) \n 2 \n \n \n 17 \n WOL (A) \n 3 \n 21 \n SOU (A) \n 2 \n \n \n \n What the experts say \n Holly Shand \u00a0( @FFCommunity_ ): Spurs have certainly had the \"new manager bounce\" so far, but I need to see more than one good performance before investing.  Son  looks the most appealing, but  Dele Alli  (\u00a38.4m) could emerge as a great differential! \n Sam Bonfield \u00a0( @FPLFamily ): What a change in Spurs for those first 60 minutes on Saturday. Off the back of his performance it\u2019s no surprise that Son is being transferred in. However,  Alli  looked back to his old self playing in that No 10 role that's so pivotal in a Mourinho side. He looked energetic and was in all the right positions. He was unlucky not to have more than his one assist and is on my radar. \n Lee Bonfield \u00a0( @FPLFamily ): Whoa there, FPL managers! Spurs were improved for sure, but the Hammers didn't put up much of a fight. Kane, Alli and Son all come with hefty FPL price tags, so if investing means a big points hit, I'd urge caution and wait for Mourinho's men to pass some tougher tests over the next few weeks. \n Chuck Booth \u00a0( @ChuckBoothSport ): I already have Kane in my team so I'm hesitant to add a second Spurs attacker, but with Son in a financial no man's land,  Lucas \u00a0and  Paulo Gazzaniga  (\u00a34.5m) are my players to watch. Lucas looks likely to get a proper run under Mourinho while Gazzaniga should benefit from an improved defence. \n Ben McNair  ( @drbenmcnair ): \u00a0I'd like to wait and see how things pan out. A win over West Ham isn't the greatest achievement at the moment.  Son  is the one I'm most interested in. He's such a good finisher with both feet. First I'd like to see whether he's shackled with extra defensive duties under Mourinho when protecting a lead. \n Also in this series\u00a0 \n Part 2:  FPL Lessons: Wide role lifting Rashford \n",

He was also the\u00a0joint-top scorer in Gameweek 12 with 12 points. \n Elsewhere in defence,  Leicester City  produced their sixth clean sheet of the season in a 2-0 win at  Brighton and Hove Albion . \n As a result, Foxes trio  Ricardo Pereira  (\u00a36.4m),  Ben Chilwell  (\u00a35.8m) and  Caglar Soyuncu  (\u00a34.9m) are among the five top-scoring defenders in FPL. \n First centurion\u00a0 \n Leicester striker  Jamie Vardy  (\u00a39.7m) was the most-selected captain in Gameweek 13 and he enjoyed yet more success. \n Vardy banked his fifth double-digit haul of 2019/20 with a goal, an assist and maximum bonus at the Amex Stadium, becoming the first player to pass 100 FPL points this term. \n Another premium forward,  Alexandre Lacazette  (\u00a39.3m), matched Vardy's 12 points by scoring twice in\u00a0 Arsenal 's 2-2 draw with  Southampton . \n And Saints striker  Danny Ings  (\u00a36.0m) extended his run of goals with the opener at Emirates Stadium.\u00a0 \n Ings has scored in five of the last seven Gameweeks, and his schedule further strengthens his appeal as a cut-price forward. \n Four of Southampton's next five matches score just two in the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR). \n Son turning heads \n Tottenham Hotspur  also have some favourable fixtures and  Jose Mourinho 's first match in charge ended in a 3-2 victory over  West Ham United . \n Son Heung-min  (\u00a39.7m) was Spurs\u2019 top performer, with a goal and an assist earning him 13 points. \n He is currently the most-bought FPL player for Gameweek 14, earning 88,000+ new owners. \n Riyad Mahrez  (\u00a38.3m),  Joao Moutinho  (\u00a35.3m) and  Todd Cantwell  (\u00a34.6m) were also among the top-scoring FPL midfielders in Gameweek 13, with 10 points apiece. \n Cantwell marked his first start since Gameweek 10 with the opening goal in\u00a0 Norwich City \u2019s 2-0 win at  Everton . \n The Canaries also had  Tim Krul  (\u00a34.5m) to thank at the other end of the pitch at Goodison Park, with the Dutchman\u2019s seven saves earning him 11 points against the Toffees. \n Owned by just 1.6 per cent, Krul remains a strong differential thanks to his save-point potential.

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke is looking at key tactical talking points ahead of Matchweek 13. \n \n \n \n \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 2 \n \n SOU \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Wastefulness in front of goal has been a recurring issue for  Southampton  in recent seasons but summer signing  Moussa Djenepo  is doing his best to buck that trend. \n From only two starts and 220 minutes of a stop-start debut Premier League season, the 21-year-old has scored two spectacular, match-winning goals. \n The Mali international announced his\u00a0arrival with a long-range drive into the top corner to open the scoring in a 2-0 victory at  Brighton & Hove Albion . \n And on 14 September he finished off a mesmeric solo dribble with a low shot to secure a 1-0 win at  Sheffield United . That contribution earned him the  Budweiser Goal of the Month award  for September. \n A muscular injury kept Djenepo out of action until early November, when he returned with a six-minute cameo\u00a0as a substitute in the 2-1 defeat at  Manchester City . \n And after completing 90 minutes in the Matchweek 12 loss to  Everton , and scoring against Chad during the international break, he should be fully fit and raring to go on Saturday when Saints travel to  Arsenal . \n Watch Djenepo's winner against Blades \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Manager  Ralph Hasenhuttl \u00a0has missed the cutting edge of a player who has scored Saints' only two winning goals of the season to date. \n Against Sheffield United, the Austrian initially experimented by using Djenepo as a left wing-back. \n But after 30 minutes, it was clear the\u00a0summer signing was struggling with his defensive positioning and had become a target for the Blades. \n Once moved into a more familiar attacking midfield berth, the former Standard Liege man was a revelation. \n Using his power, pace and nimble footwork to torment defenders, he completed an impressive six successful dribbles. \n Most of those runs were in dangerous areas around the penalty area and one of them produced the winner. \n Avoiding individual duels \n Arsenal will be wary of Djenepo's threat at Emirates Stadium on Saturday. \n While the Gunners are unbeaten at home to Southampton in 24 league matches stretching back to 1987,  Unai Emery 's side have not won in the Premier League since Matchweek 8. \n And seven of the eight points that Saints have won this season have come on the road. \n So Arsenal will need their midfielders to get tight on Djenepo whenever he drives inside at speed, working hard to crowd him out. \n Emery has a decision over whom to start at right-back.  Hector Bellerin  is back fit but has made only one start all season, so Djenepo could exploit any lack of match sharpness. \n If the winger is given the room to isolate individuals one-v-one, he has shown he has the skill to transform a contest with a moment of brilliance. \n Djenepo's Premier League stats \n \n \n \n 2019/20 \n Total \n \n \n \n \n Minutes \n 220 \n \n \n Goals \n 2 \n \n \n Shots \n 5 \n \n \n Shots on target \n 3 \n \n \n Succ. dribbles \n 13 \n \n \n Pass accuracy \n 84.9% \n \n \n \n Djenepo scored eight times in 24 starts in last season's Belgian Jupiler League, at a rate of one goal every 258 minutes. \n It was a respectable return for the winger, who ended the campaign with a conversion rate of 17.4 per cent. \n At Southampton, he has scored a goal every 110 minutes and has a 40 per cent shot-conversion rate. \n That level will be impossible to maintain. But Djenepo's right foot looks like it can be a destructive weapon this season. \n Future striker? \n Hasenhuttl has plenty of options in forward areas. \n Danny Ings  has scored five times in 12 Premier League appearances this season, while\u00a0 Che Adams \u00a0has at times looked lively despite still waiting for his first Saints goal. \n Nathan Redmond \u00a0has shown signs of emulating the form that won him the club's 2018/19 Player of the Season award and Hasenhuttl can also pick\u00a0 Shane Long  up front. \n But do not be surprised if Djenepo is deployed as a second striker in the coming weeks, playing just behind the centre-forward. \n His speed, balance and trickery will frighten defenders in the centre of the pitch and his finishing looks excellent. \n Djenepo appears to be the kind of maverick match-winner that Southampton have lacked since  Sadio Mane  left for  Liverpool  in 2016. \n \n Also in this series\u00a0 \n Part 1:  Palace adventure against Liverpool can work wonders Part 3:  Mourinho must solve pressing issue for fast Spurs start Part 4:  Angelino a two-way target for Man City and Chelsea Part 5:\u00a0 Martial can make the difference at Sheff Utd \n",

It will frighten defenders and in a team lacking creators it makes sense to use the Ivorian closer to Ayew. \n Apart from Zaha and box-to-box midfielder  James McArthur , Crystal Palace do not have a great deal of inventiveness. \n Least creative PL teams 2019/20 \n \n \n \n Fewest chances created \n Fewest big chances created \n Fewest succ. crosses \n \n \n \n \n CRY \n 66 \n CRY \n 8\u00a0 \n NOR \n 10\u00a0 \n \n \n SOU \n 75 \n NOR\u00a0 \n 12\u00a0 \n CRY\u00a0 \n 14\u00a0 \n \n \n NEW \n 78 \n TOT\u00a0 \n 13\u00a0 \n SOU\u00a0 \n 19\u00a0 \n \n \n \n The Eagles have lost their last five home meetings with Liverpool in all competitions and head into Matchweek 13 with only two wins from six matches at Selhurst Park this season. \n Making the aforementioned tweaks against Liverpool would be bold but it may work wonders. \n Hodgson's emphasis on discipline and team shape will be important, with  Gary Cahill  and  Luka Milivojevic  key defensive figures. \n But to take points from the leaders, Palace will need to strike the right balance between being sensible and showing adventure. \n If they can find the right mix against the Reds, and in the months to come, they have the potential to finish in the top half for the first time since 2014/15.\u00a0 \n Also in this series \n Part 2:\u00a0 Djenepo can be heir to Mane for Southampton Part 3:  Mourinho must solve pressing issue for fast Spurs start Part 4:  Angelino a two-way target for Man City and Chelsea Part 5:\u00a0 Martial can make the difference at Sheff Utd \n",

Or, 'Are you going to kick in behind and say we don't want this?' \n \"They suss you out for the first 15 minutes and they did that against Manchester City and even though they were not playing well, they found themselves 2-0 up.\" \n 'Big shock' possible \n But Palace were the last team to win in the league at Anfield, in April 2017, and Townsend says low expectations can liberate the Eagles to repeat the feat. \n \"You approach the game differently, you know you are not going to get much possession,\" he adds. \"You know you will have to defend for 90 minutes, even as a winger. \n \"My main priority going into the game, is that I need to be a defender first. If we get counter-attacks, I will attack, but definitely if you defend well and take your chances at the other side you can definitely pull off a shock, as we have proven many times before. \n \"It is going to be difficult, but if you do the defensive things perfectly and going forward you are clinical, you can pull off a big shock.\" \n Also in this series \n Part 2:\u00a0 Townsend: Eagles ready to soar again \n",

He\u00a0has boasted their main goal threat from the back, with five shots inside the box. \n Serge Aurier  (\u00a34.8m) and\u00a0 Paulo Gazzaniga \u00a0(\u00a34.5m) could appeal as less expensive picks. \n Aurier has averaged 4.1 points per match at right-back, while Gazzaniga\u00a0is set for an extended run of starts due to the long-term absence of their first-choice goalkeeper,  Hugo Lloris  (\u00a35.4m). \n But it is in attack where the real interest could lie. \n If Kane and Son can return to top form under Mourinho, they could be major captaincy contenders during the busy festive period. \n",

        "text": "\n When playing at home,  Alexandre Lacazette  (\u00a39.3m) has been a reliable performer in 2019/20  Fantasy Premier League . \n The  Arsenal  forward has produced a goal or an assist in all four of his appearances at Emirates Stadium this season. \n The underlying statistics highlight his attacking potential. \n At home, no Gunners player has bettered the Frenchman's 12 shots inside the penalty area or his total of eight shots on target. \n Lacazette looks well-placed to punish a\u00a0 Southampton  side who have conceded 23 goals in the last seven Gameweeks. \n He takes his place in a Scout Selection which lines up in a 3-4-3 formation, with  Liverpool 's\u00a0 Sadio Mane  (\u00a312.1m) handed the armband and  Jamie Vardy  (\u00a39.6m) of  Leicester City  given the vice-captaincy. \n Ben Foster (WAT) \u00a34.8m \n The  Watford \u00a0No 1 has stepped up his FPL output ahead of a visit from  Burnley . Foster has produced 34 of his 46 points for the season in the last five Gameweeks. \n Trent Alexander-Arnold (LIV) \u00a37.2m \n Liverpool 's attacking right-back offers points potential at both ends of the pitch at\u00a0 Crystal Palace . Alexander-Arnold has one goal, two assists and two clean sheets in his last five away trips. \n Mason Holgate (EVE) \u00a34.4m \n The centre-back has two assists in the last three Gameweeks for  Everton .  Marco Silva 's Toffees host a  Norwich City  side who have scored just one away goal in 2019/20. \n Frederic Guilbert (AVL) \u00a34.4m \n A home contest with\u00a0 Newcastle United \u00a0makes the Frenchman a strong, cut-price candidate. Guilbert has delivered attacking or defensive returns in four of his five appearances at Villa Park. \n Son Heung-min (TOT) \u00a39.6m \n The South Korean can continue his impressive away form in  Tottenham Hotspur 's first match under  Jose Mourinho . Son visits  West Ham United  having produced attacking returns in four of his five appearances on the road this season. \n Richarlison (EVE) \u00a37.9m \n At home, the Brazilian's 15 shots in the box are more than double any other Everton player. He can punish a Norwich defence who have conceded 28 goals in the opening 12 Gameweeks. The Canaries have also recorded a clean sheet on only one occasion in 2019/20. \n John McGinn (AVL) \u00a35.8m \n At home, the Scot's 19 shots and seven shots on target are more than any other  Aston Villa  player. McGinn comes up against a Newcastle defence who have conceded a league-leading 14 away goals. \n Sadio Mane (LIV) \u00a312.1m \n The top-scoring midfielder in FPL, Mane has a fine record against Crystal Palace. He has found the net in each of his last four Premier League meetings with the Eagles. \n Alexandre Lacazette (ARS) \u00a39.3m \n An ownership of only 1.7 per cent highlights the Frenchman's potential as a major differential for the Gameweek 13 armband. \n Jamie Vardy (LEI) \u00a39.6m \n Eight goals and two assists in the last six Gameweeks have lifted the in-form Leicester forward to the top of the FPL player standings. More than 419,000 managers have bought Vardy ahead of the Foxes' visit to  Brighton & Hove Albion . \n Raul Jimenez (WOL) \u00a37.3m \n Mexico international Jimenez has three goals and two assists in the last five Gameweeks for  Wolverhampton Wanderers . He looks set to pose big problems for this weekend's hosts,  AFC Bournemouth . \n What the experts say \n Sam Bonfield \u00a0( @FPLFamily ): Wow, what a team this is! I must admit my first reaction was, \"Why isn't Vardy captain?\" but the Mane v Palace stats look amazing. Richarlison looks a great one-week punt pick; with three returns in the last four and playing out of position as a striker he should return good points this weekend. \n Holly Shand \u00a0( @FFCommunity_ ): Son could be a great differential now with the new manager bounce! I'm expecting Richarlison to do well against Norwich. \n Ash  ( @FPLHints ): Jimenez is a good shout for Gameweek 13 and the weeks ahead once UEFA Europa League football pauses until the spring. I also think McGinn could replicate same of his international form against Newcastle on Monday night. \n Lee Bonfield \u00a0( @FPLFamily ): I'm keeping a close eye on Son and the impact Mourinho has on him. It might just be a week early after the international fixtures, though. \n Neal Thurman  ( @nealjthurman ): Palace have been tough defensively and going to Selhurst Park has been a tough assignment, so Vardy at Brighton seems much more conducive to a multiple-goal return. \n Ben Crabtree \u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ): Double Everton is a rarity but the fixture justifies it. Both players are differentials of great potential this week. \n Ben McNair \u00a0( @drbenmcnair ) : I like the Aston Villa and Everton double-ups given their home fixtures against Newcastle and Norwich. But I would have found room for  Lucas Digne  (\u00a35.9m) and, if he's passed fit,  Jack Grealish  (\u00a35.9m), since they are the main creators for their respective teams. I'm also surprised at the omission of  Raheem Sterling  (\u00a312.0m) as I don't think  Chelsea  will be able to handle  Manchester City  at the Etihad Stadium. \n",

It's not that it got worse but it's still kind of there, that's the problem. We have to be sensible with things like this.\" \n Form contrast \n Salah's lack of form has also caused concern, with only two goals and one assist from Gameweek 6 onwards. \n Mane, meanwhile, has three goals and three assists over that period and is the top-scoring midfielder in FPL. \n The Senegalese has a strong record against Palace too, scoring in each of their last four meetings. \n And his points potential is further boosted by a very favourable upcoming schedule. \n Liverpool have a run of three home matches in four Gameweeks after this weekend, all of which score only two in the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR). \n Liverpool's next five Gameweeks\u00a0 \n \n \n \n GW \n Opp \n FDR \n \n \n \n \n 13 \n CRY (A) \n 2 \n \n \n 14 \n BHA (H) \n 2 \n \n \n 15 \n EVE (H) \n 2 \n \n \n 16 \n BOU (A) \n 3 \n \n \n 17 \n WAT (H) \n 2 \n \n \n \n While that run of opponents could persuade many of Salah's 25.2 per cent ownership to hold, it is the 37.3 per-cent owned Mane who has been their most explosive FPL performer this season. \n Having recorded four double-figure hauls to the two of Salah, Mane will be a key captain pick over the upcoming period. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:\u00a0 GW13 final call: Pulisic fit to keep scoring \n",

But another way of revealing the impact of some of this season's\u00a0outstanding performers is by using a new measurement introduced by Opta. \n Their ball-carry metric, which is being used regularly for the first time in 2019/20,\u00a0captures every instance of a player moving at least five metres with the ball. \n This data makes it possible to determine not only who runs the most with the ball, but also the effectiveness of those forays and who makes the most defining actions at the end. \n \n \n \n \n \n AVL \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 0 \n \n NEW \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n It tells us that two of the best dribblers in the league are set to go head-to-head on Monday night, with  Aston Villa 's  Jack Grealish  facing  Newcastle United 's  Allan Saint-Maximin . \n Grealish, who is back in the frame after overcoming a calf injury, has created 15 chances following ball carries this season, more than any other player in the Premier League. \n The 24-year-old has had no problem bringing his creativity to the top flight after Villa's promotion, and Newcastle will need to be alert when he is running at their defence. \n Ball carries ending in chance created \n \n \n \n Player \n Total carries \n Carries ending in chance created \n \n \n \n \n Jack Grealish \n 230 \n 15 \n \n \n Raheem Sterling \n 218 \n 14 \n \n \n Kevin De Bruyne \n 201 \n 12 \n \n \n Adama Traore \n 204 \n 11 \n \n \n Trent Alexander-Arnold \n 212 \n 11 \n \n \n \n Using another strand of the new metric, we can see which players cover the most ground while progressing upfield with the ball, by looking at their average carry progress. \n Topping this group, out of the players with at least 100 carries this season, is Newcastle winger Saint-Maximin, who is averaging a league-high 12.2 metres per carry. \n Having gradually worked his way into the starting XI, the 22-year-old has been at the heart of Newcastle's counter-attacking threat with his driving, direct runs. \n Monday's match at Villa Park could be decided by which team gets their star dribbler on the ball more often, and how much the pair hurt their foes when they get space to run into. \n Average ball carry progress \n \n \n \n Player* \n Total carries \n Ave. carry progress (m) \n \n \n \n \n Allan Saint-Maximin \n 105 \n 12.2 \n \n \n Marcus Rashford \n 119 \n 11.1 \n \n \n Diogo Jota \n 140 \n 11.0 \n \n \n Daniel James \n 148 \n 11.0 \n \n \n Ricardo Pereira \n 192 \n 10.0 \n \n \n \n * minimum 100 carries\u00a0 \n Opta's metric also underlines the importance of full-backs\u00a0 Trent Alexander-Arnold \u00a0and\u00a0 Andrew Robertson \u00a0in\u00a0 Liverpool 's title charge. \n Alongside their shared crossing ability, the duo rank among the top seven players in the league for progressive ball carries, a metric based on carries that head directly upfield. \n This is a key driver in how Liverpool sustain their attacking threat, and how their wide men get into good positions for their all-important deliveries. \n Most progressive ball carries \n \n \n \n Player \n Total carries \n Progressive ball carries* \n \n \n \n \n Andrew Robertson \n 238 \n 171 \n \n \n Matteo Guendouzi \n 300 \n 161 \n \n \n Ricardo Pereira \n 192 \n 159 \n \n \n Fernandinho \n 235 \n 155 \n \n \n Harry Maguire \n 225 \n 154 \n \n \n Adama Traore \n 204 \n 152 \n \n \n Trent Alexander-Arnold \n 212 \n 146 \n \n \n \n * minimum five metres \n From proven commodities to an early candidate for the most-improved player in the Premier League,  Mateo Kovacic  has stepped into a key role under  Frank Lampard . \n Among other attributes, it has been the Croat's ability to carry the ball in central areas that has brought him to the forefront of Lampard's midfield options. \n The 25-year-old has averaged more ball carries per 90 than any other midfielder this term, with 30.2, making him a vital force in  Chelsea \u2019s new-look attacking style. \n Most ball carries per 90 mins \n \n \n \n Player \n Total carries \n Carries/90 \n \n \n \n \n Mateo Kovacic \n 296 \n 30.2 \n \n \n Fernandinho \n 235 \n 27.5 \n \n \n Bernardo Silva \n 209 \n 25.8 \n \n \n Sofiane Boufal \n 122 \n 25.4 \n \n \n Rodri \n 238 \n 24.3 \n \n \n Dani Ceballos \n 179 \n 24.3 \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n",

Instead,\u00a0he prefers his teams to squeeze space from a lower block in the middle third. \n On Saturday you can expect Spurs' players to keep a solid shape before trying to crowd out the Hammers once they cross the halfway line. \n It will be a surprise if they do not close down their hosts with greater hostility than they have done so far this term. \n Springing more breaks \n Winning fewer turnovers has affected Spurs' ability to breach defences. In the last two-and-a-half seasons there has been a noticeable slump in this regard. \n The north Londoners have spent too much time playing in front of the opposition, failing to stretch rival teams and creating fewer goalscoring opportunities. \n Mourinho will be looking to develop a more forceful way of attacking. \n Drop in Spurs' goal threat \n \n \n \n Premier League \n 17/18 rank \n 18/19 rank \n 19/20 rank \n 19/20 total \n \n \n \n \n Shots on target in box \n 5th \n 5th \n 17th \n 29 \n \n \n Big chances created \n 4th \n 7th \n 16th \n 13 \n \n \n Touches in opp. box \n 5th \n 7th \n 12th \n 269 \n \n \n \n Mourinho's teams have always been strong in transition, so look out for them driving forward with greater purpose when possession changes hands. \n The pacy\u00a0 Son Heung-min  looks tailor-made for his new head coach. \n The South Korean's intense work-rate and surging runs should suit Mourinho's style. \n What shape for Spurs? \n Spurs have started in six different formations this season, with 4-2-3-1 their most-used shape, selected\u00a0on six occasions. \n Similarly, Mourinho has used a variety of systems during his long and illustrious career but in his last two Premier League posts his preference has been for 4-2-3-1. \n The 56-year-old is not afraid to experiment with a back three but it would be a surprise if he begins this regime with that shape. \n Mourinho's most-used formations \n \n \n \n Club \n Starting formation \n PL matches \n \n \n \n \n Chelsea  2013-15\u00a0 \n 4-2-3-1 \n 87 \n \n \n 4-3-3 \n 5 \n \n \n Man Utd  2016-18 \n 4-2-3-1 \n 42 \n \n \n 4-3-3 \n 37 \n \n \n 3-4-1-2 \n 4 \n \n \n 5-3-2 \n 3 \n \n \n Others \n 7 \n \n \n \n Team selection will be interesting this weekend and Spurs' style of play will be under the microscope. \n Pochettino's philosophy was slightly more attack-minded than that of his successor. \n But both head coaches have been at their best when motivating their teams to perform with drive and controlled aggression. \n In a tactical sense don't expect an immediate or dramatic overhaul. \n But Mourinho's priority at his new club will be to find that lost spark and revive Spurs' strong-willed approach. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 Palace adventure against Liverpool can work wonders Part 2:\u00a0 Djenepo can be heir to Mane for Southampton Part 4:  Angelino a two-way target for Man City and Chelsea Part 5:\u00a0 Martial can make the difference at Sheff Utd \n",

        "text": "\n The  Fantasy Premier League  experts have made three transfers ahead of\u00a0Gameweek 13. \n They had two free trades to use and have opted to swap three players, taking a four-point hit. \n Jamie Vardy  (\u00a39.6m),  Youri Tielemans  (\u00a36.7m) and  Jack Grealish  (\u00a35.9m) have all been brought into\u00a0the  FPL Experts Panel Team \u00a0ahead of Saturday's 11:30 GMT deadline. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Vardy is the most popular signing this Gameweek, gaining over 394,000 new owners for\u00a0 Leicester City \u2019s trip to  Brighton & Hove Albion . \n He is immediately handed the captaincy on the back of eight goals and two assists in his last six matches. \n Vardy and Tielemans\u00a0slot in alongside  Calgar Soyuncu  (\u00a34.9m), with the experts opting to triple up on Leicester for their favourable upcoming schedule. \n Following this weekend, the Foxes' next four opponents score just two in the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR). \n Grealish appeal \n Grealish goes straight into the starting XI as  Aston Villa  host  Newcastle United . The midfielder returned 13 points in his last home appearance with a goal, an assist and three bonus points. \n But the experts' patience with\u00a0 Raheem Sterling  (\u00a312.0m) has finally run out after a run of poor form.\u00a0 Manchester City 's winger has provided just two goals and an assist in the last nine Gameweeks. \n Indeed, Sterling blanked on six of the eight occasions he was handed the\u00a0captain's armband for the experts\u2019 team. \n Callum Hudson-Odoi  (\u00a35.8m) and\u00a0 Aaron Connolly  (\u00a34.7m) have also been sold.\u00a0Hudson-Odoi has been named on the bench for Chelsea's last three matches, while Brighton's Connolly is set to miss Gameweek 13 through injury. \n What the experts say \n Holly Shand  ( @FFCommunity_ ): Moves for in-form Leicester players were necessary and long overdue. Man City have tough fixtures and we will be hoping Sterling doesn't punish us. \n Tom  ( @WGTA_FPL ): The lack of Leicester players was stark and our team looked at a fork in the road in terms of its composition. Using both frees and taking a minus four for the two Leicester players made sense, plus Grealish rotates with Soyuncu and  Fikayo Tomori  (\u00a34.8m). \n Sam Bonfield  ( @FPLFamily ): Sterling's Fantasy returns haven't matched his price tag. In terms of points per million he just isn't good value right now. Vardy, on the other hand, looks essential and so freeing up Sterling money to invest in Vardy looks a great move. At the \u00a36.7m price tag, Tielemans looks the best bet to replace the oft-benched Hudson-Odoi. \n Paul Gee  ( @FPLPaulGee ): It was time to release a bit of cash to upgrade to Leicester players. \n Mark McGettigan  ( @FPLGeneral ): I like the minus four this week as it gets rid of two unreliable assets, Hudson-Odoi and Connolly, and gets us three solid options for the busy period ahead. Hopefully Grealish can take control of penalties at Aston Villa soon. \n Can you do better? \n Managers who want to take on the panel should enter the private classic league \" Beat the FPL Panel \". \n Join:  FPL Panel mini-league  (insert code:  3hdr4s ). \n Remember to select your Gameweek 13 team before Saturday\u2019s deadline of 11:30 GMT. \n",

In the six matches without him that figure drops to just four. \n Watch Martial and Rashford's link-ups\u00a0 \n Scoring nine goals in his last 10 appearances in all competitions, Rashford is another potential game-changer this weekend. \n Playing on the left wing instead of a more central striking role, he looks happy, powerful and brimming with confidence. \n The 22-year-old is likely to affect the number of forward runs Blades right wing-back  George Baldock  chooses to make at Bramall Lane. \n Blades' right-sided central defender  Chris Basham  must also be careful not to leave any space to exploit. \n Any lapses in concentration or positional mistakes from Baldock or Basham could be punished. \n Martial and Rashford stats \n \n \n \n 2019/20 \n Martial \n Rashford \n \n \n \n \n Shots \n 11 \n 29 \n \n \n Shots on target \n 9 \n 15 \n \n \n Goals \n 3 \n 6 \n \n \n Mins/goal \n 177.0 \n 173.2 \n \n \n Conversion rate \n 27.3 \n 20.7 \n \n \n \n We know Sheff Utd's incredible shape, discipline and pressing make them defensively resolute. \n With just nine goals conceded, they boast the second-best record in the Premier League, behind only  Leicester City . \n Yet in central defence they do lack pace. \n So do not be surprised if  Chris Wilder  sets his team up in a slightly lower block than usual, sacrificing a bit of possession. \n The Blades manager made this tweak at home to  Arsenal  in the second half of their 1-0 victory, having seen his side carved open by several fast breaks earlier in the match. \n Slowing down Man Utd's fast forward line will be of paramount importance to Wilder. \n As  Dean Henderson  is ineligible to face his parent club,  Simon Moore  is in line to make his Premier League debut in goal, so we may see a more pragmatic performance. \n Leaving empty space for Rashford, Martial and James to run into will the first thing the Sheff Utd defenders will look to stop. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 Palace adventure against Liverpool can work wonders Part 2:\u00a0 Djenepo can be heir to Mane for Southampton Part 3:\u00a0 Mourinho must solve pressing issue for fast Spurs start Part 4:  Angelino a two-way target for Man City and Chelsea \u00a0 \n",

He has scored seven goals against them, more than he has managed against any other side. \n Mohamed Salah  (\u00a312.3m) should also be considered if he can overcome an ankle problem.\u00a0 \n The Egyptian has three goals and two assists in his last three Premier League meetings with  Roy Hodgson 's side. \n City and Chelsea stars face off \n Manchester City \u2019s home encounter with  Chelsea  offers a number of captaincy options. \n Sergio Aguero  (\u00a312.0m) and  Raheem Sterling  (\u00a312.0m)\u00a0come up against a Chelsea defence that have failed to keep a clean sheet on the road this season, conceding 12 goals in six away matches. \n \n \n \n Sterling has produced 12 shots inside the penalty area in the last four Gameweeks, a total bettered by just three other players. \n Aguero, meanwhile, scored a hat-trick in the corresponding fixture last term. \n At home, his 22 shots in the box are more than any other player this season. \n Back the Blues? \n Tammy Abraham  (\u00a38.0m) and  Christian Pulisic  (\u00a37.4m) visit the Etihad Stadium in strong form. \n Abraham has scored more away goals than any other player in 2019/20 FPL, getting seven of his 10 strikes this season on the road. \n Pulisic will also be a leading captaincy choice if he recovers from a hip problem. He has scored all five of his goals for the season in the last three Gameweeks. \n What the experts say \n Holly Shand  ( @FFCommunity_ ): I was set on Mane but potential injuries to Salah and  Andrew Robertson  (\u00a37.0m) might weaken Liverpool as a whole. I may revert to the safe and consistent  Jamie Vardy  (\u00a39.6m). \n Ash  ( @FPLHints ):  Vardy  appears to be the standout armband pick again. He is arguably in even better form than in\u00a0 Leicester City \u2019s title-winning run in 2015/16.  Lewis Dunk  (\u00a34.6m) will also be missing from  Brighton & Hove Albion \u2019s defence, which will open them up further. \n Paul Gee  ( @FPLPaulGee ):  Sterling  is a great candidate in my opinion. Chelsea concede a lot, even though they are in form right now. I expect Man City to bounce back. \n Ben Crabtree \u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ): There are likely to be a variety of captain picks this week. As an owner of\u00a0 Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang  (\u00a311.0m), I can't look past him at home against\u00a0 Southampton , despite some concerns over  Arsenal 's form. \n Mark McGettigan  ( @FPLGeneral ): I'm going to stick with  Vardy  after he served me well in Gameweek 12. Mane and Sterling are great options this week too, while  Richarlison  (\u00a37.9m) could be worth a punt for his owners at home against\u00a0 Norwich City . \n Ben McNair  ( @drbenmcnair ):  I think I'll be handing the armband to  Sterling  yet again. He was superb at Anfield in the last Gameweek and unlucky to walk away without FPL returns. Over the past six Gameweeks, he has more than double the penalty-area touches of any other player. Chelsea's defence has been far from watertight on the road and I think City will create plenty of chances as usual. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  GW13 Captains: Vardy goal streak to continue \n",

        "text": "\n It's always the same for  Fantasy Premier League Draft  managers after an international break. \n We wait for updates on any minor injuries, or the chances that a player is fatigued due to extensive travel after featuring for his country. \n At present, there are doubts over  Mohamed Salah  and  Andrew Robertson  for  Liverpool 's match at  Crystal Palace , and their absence would certainly create some chaos, as well as opportunity. \n News updates will come quickly between now and when matches kick off and the advantage goes to managers who stay informed and act quickly. \n We'll also see the debut of  Jose Mourinho  as  Tottenham Hotspur 's head coach this weekend, which presents all sorts of possibilities of improved performances and/or revised roles for a group of players who,  Son Heung-min  aside, haven't been performing to expectations. \n Heading into the Gameweek 13 waiver, here are my priority recommendations. \n GKP: Tom Heaton (BUR) \n It looks like Heaton has recovered from his calf injury and he has a tempting home match against\u00a0 Newcastle United . If you're looking for a longer-term solution, I expect\u00a0 Paulo Gazzaniga  is available in your eight-team league and will benefit from at least a temporary bounce back under Mourinho. \n DEF: Mason Holgate (EVE) \n There's a slight chance that Holgate could lose his spot to  Michael Keane  but he played very well in the win over  Southampton  and it would be hard for  Marco Silva  to justify dropping him. With an injury-riddled  Norwich City \u00a0side heading to Goodison Park, Holgate is a nice short-term pick-up. On the Spurs front, I will be very interested to see who Mourinho starts in the wide positions. Whoever gets the call immediately becomes an attractive longer-term option. \n MID: Tanguy Ndombele (TOT) \n Ndombele feels like a very Mourinho-ish player so, assuming that whoever drafted  Christian Eriksen  didn't ditch him a week too early, Ndombele would be my choice as a long-term pick-up. I wouldn't object to someone opting for  Lucas Moura \u00a0either. If you're looking for a one-week only option then  Ayoze Perez  against  Brighton & Hove Albion  or  Harry Wilson  at home against\u00a0 Wolverhampton Wanderers  would be my choices. \n FWD: Divock Origi (LIV) \n If Salah misses out due to his ankle issue then\u00a0Origi seems likeliest to get the start and immediately becomes the priority target among short-term options. If it turns out that Salah is fit to play then  Cenk Tosun  has the potential for a big weekend against Norwich. My third choice would be  Lys Mousset  at home against\u00a0 Manchester United . \n",

        "text": "\n With registrations now open for 2019/20  ePremier League , we spoke with players who shone last season to find out what it was like to play in the competition, as well as getting their tips for success. \n Luke Mcilwee-Davies \n The Cardiff City supporter had a superb campaign in 2018/19, breezing through his club playoffs and reaching the knockout stages before being beaten in the quarter-finals of the PlayStation competition.\u00a0 \n How important is it for you to represent your club? \n It was amazing to represent the team I love. It was important to me that I went as far as possible in the tournament for my team. \n How did you become an ePL finalist? \n I've played EA SPORTS FIFA ever since FIFA07. I have always loved football so FIFA always attracted my attention. I started playing games against my dad or older brother, and as the years went on I started to realise that I was really good at this game as I used to beat my friends all the time. It wasn't until last year where I took all that to the next step. \n I was hitting elite all the time in FIFA Ultimate Team Champions and I was decent at it. My brother told me all about ePremier League and said I should sign up, so I thought I might as well. \n After winning the online qualification and the club playoffs my confidence was sky-high. Going to London I was the underdog so after getting through the group stage in the finals I was the only person to not be verified. Although it was upsetting to be knocked out in the quarter-finals I was happy that I even got that far, and that I was able to represent a club I love and to make them proud.\u00a0 \n Top three tips for anyone new to the ePL \n 1.\u00a0Keep playing as often as possible to get better at the game. Play division rivals and FIFA\u00a0Ultimate Team Champions as it's the most competitive game mode you can play to get you ready for the ePL. \n 2. Represent the team you choose to play for proudly, regardless of if it isn't the team you support. Just do the best you can for yourself and your chosen team. \n 3. Nerves are natural. Going from playing a game in your home to playing in front of thousands of people, I was extremely nervous throughout the whole tournament. Going to the Cardiff City Stadium to win the playoffs I was very nervous, but as that day went on the confidence kept building up. This helped a lot when it came to going to London for the finals. Just get yourself out there, push yourself and you'll become more confident. \n What advice would you give amateurs for setting up their team for playing online? \n It is essential to have a good squad. Play lots of rivals matches and do anything on FIFA\u00a0Ultimate Team to earn as many coins as possible. The more coins you have, the better team you can build. Although skill is the biggest factor when it comes to FIFA, if you go into a match the better player but with a 10k gold squad, if your opponent has players as good as Messi or Ronaldo it won't take him as many shots to score as it would for you.\u00a0 \n What formation and tactics work best for you when playing online? \n As of now I'm still getting used to this game but I'm currently using the favourite formation for most from last year's FIFA, which is 4-2-3-1. That's two defensive midfielders sitting back cutting out passes, then three attacking midfielders. The wide CAMs are basically like wingers but aren't as wide. This formation is really effective for me and works well with my current squad and playing style. \n What three\u00a0FIFA Ultimate Team\u00a0players are must-haves for this season's ePL competition? \n Kylian Mbappe,\u00a0Antoine Griezmann,\u00a0N'Golo Kante. \n See:\u00a0 Register at e.premierleague.com \n",

Aware of their shortcomings in the final third, Bruce has focused hard on staying in matches through a solid 5-4-1 shape. \n Averaging only 33 per cent possession, the lowest in the division, they have soaked up a lot of pressure before striking on counters or from set-pieces. \n This strategy has helped restrict all six visiting teams to St James' Park to only one goal or less. \n Newcastle's wins in 2019/20 \n \n \n \n Match \n Possession \n \n \n \n \n TOT 0-1 NEW \n 19.8% \n \n \n NEW 1-0 MUN \n 31.9% \n \n \n WHU 2-3 NEW \n 30.5% \n \n \n NEW 2-1 BOU \n 33.7% \n \n \n \n Remarkably, of the 11 goals scored by Bruce's side this season, only one has come from a forward. \n Apart from  Joelinton 's winner in the 1-0 success at  Tottenham Hotspur , Newcastle's goals have come from eight players of a far more defensive nature. \n Midfielder  Jonjo Shelvey  and defender  Ciaran Clark  have weighed in with two strikes each this term, while the remaining goals have been shared by half a dozen players including  Matty Longstaff ,  Jetro Willems ,  DeAndre Yedlin  and  Jamaal Lascelles . \n Indeed, seven of their last nine Premier League goals have been scored by defenders. \n And importantly, Clark's two efforts from dead-ball situations in the last two matches have effectively earned four additional points alone. \n Converting chances \n Newcastle are certainly capable of creating chances from open play. \n With the dazzling skill and speed of  Allan Saint-Maximin  and  Miguel Almiron , they are now a threat on breakaways. \n Exciting to watch and useful outlets on the counter-attack, the duo could be Bruce's key weapons as the season progresses. \n All that has been missing is the finishing touch, with Joelinton, Almiron and Saint-Maximin squandering great opportunities. \n To avoid slipping down the table, this trio need to add to their neat approach work by delivering an end product. \n Newcastle's attacking players \n \n \n \n Player \n Shots \n Big chances missed \n \n \n \n \n Joelinton \n 17 \n 3 \n \n \n Almiron \n 12 \n 4 \n \n \n Saint-Maximin \n 8 \n 3 \n \n \n \n News that influential captain Lascelles  will be out injured  until January 2020 is a big blow for the Magpies. \n Not only does the 26-year-old offer leadership qualities but he is their linchpin in defence. \n Lascelles has proved increasingly difficult to pass. He has been dribbled past only once all season, is dominant in both boxes and consistent at blocking shots. \n Interestingly, although Lascelles is out, tonight's match will feature three of this season's other top defenders in 1v1 situations in  Tyrone Mings ,  Bjorn Engels  and  Paul Dummett . \n Players beaten by fewest dribbles* \n \n \n \n 2019/20 \n Club \n Starts \n Dribbled past \n \n \n \n \n Tyrone Mings \n AVL \n 12 \n 0 \n \n \n Victor Lindelof \n MUN \n 12 \n 0 \n \n \n John Stones \n MCI \n 6 \n 0 \n \n \n Jamaal Lascelles \n NEW \n 12 \n 1 \n \n \n Bjorn Engels \n AVL \n 11 \n 1 \n \n \n Fikayo Tomori \n CHE \n 10 \n 1 \n \n \n Seamus Coleman \n EVE \n 8 \n 1 \n \n \n Paul Dummett \n NEW \n 7 \n 1 \n \n \n \n *minimum six starts \n Fortunately for Bruce, his remaining defensive players are enjoying solid campaigns. \n At wing-back, Willems and Yedlin have been resolute inside their own half while also offering quality going forward. \n The centre-backs, including Clark and Dummett, who is primarily a left-back but has stepped into a more central role occasionally, have performed solidly in most matches too. \n Fabian Schar \u00a0regularly breaks up attacks, making 2.49 interceptions per 90 minutes on average, while  Federico Fernandez  has won 6.76 aerial duels per 90 minutes. \n How the Magpies cope without captain Lascelles will be crucial, and his absence places an even greater emphasis on the forwards to improve their finishing. \n To sustain this promising run, Newcastle will have to be efficient at both ends of the pitch. \n",

        "text": "\n With registrations now open for 2019/20  ePremier League , we spoke with players who shone last season to find out what it was like to play in the competition, as well as getting their tips for success. \n Jake Simpson \n Jake, from Consett, County Durham, took part in his first major live competitive event when he entered 2018/19 ePL. He won in the final of the club playoffs for the right to represent his beloved  Newcastle United  at the Xbox Grand Final in London. \n How important is it for you to represent your club? \n Anyone who knows me knows how much it meant to represent Newcastle United. Especially being from the North East, football is so important to the area and Newcastle are known for our passionate fanbase so being able to represent them as a supporter myself was special.\u00a0 \n How did you become an ePL finalist? \n I signed up as soon as I saw that the ePL was announced. \n At the live event I felt like a complete underdog and that nobody knew who I was, which all worked in my favour. I had beaten professionals online before so I had complete confidence in my ability to replicate the same form in the tournament format despite my lack of experience. \n How has success in the ePL helped you progress into the professional scene? \n The ePL gave me a great boost in getting my name out there and making friends within the pro scene, but I still feel like I'm at the start of my FIFA journey and want to build on last year. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n What did it feel like to qualify for the club playoffs? \n I knew from a pretty early stage that I was going to qualify for the club playoff, so it wasn't a surprise, but going to St James' Park to compete and then go on to win was a great experience. \n What was it like representing Newcastle in the finals? \n Being the first person to represent the club within eSports is a piece of history that nobody can take away from me. \n Top three tips for anyone new to the ePL? \n 1. Stay calm and keep your head 2. Composure in front of goal 3. Learn multiple formations to use at different points during the game \n What advice would you give amateurs for setting up their team for playing online? \n Find a formation that works for you defensively, and in attack too, and then get used to it. Maybe watch pros play to see if you can pick up on any little movements they do in and around the box to create space. \n What formation and tactics work best for you when playing online? \n For me, 4-2-3-1 gives the best balance between attack and defence. With the four attackers being so close together, it makes for a fluid attack while having two defensive midfielders ready to stop any counter-attack.\u00a0 \n Which three\u00a0FIFA Ultimate Team\u00a0players are must-haves for this season's ePL competition? \n Virgil van Dijk ,  Son Heung-min \u00a0and  Kevin De Bruyne .\u00a0 \n See:\u00a0 Register at e.premierleague.com \n",

He dominates his penalty area, is a good communicator and the stats don't lie - five clean sheets so far is an impressive return. A real safe pair of hands. \n Trent Alexander-Arnold \u00a0( LIV ) \n If last season was promising, this one has started even better for the  Liverpool  full-back. The powerful attacking runs he makes and deadly deliveries are a forward's dream. And to think he's still only 21. \n John Egan \u00a0( SHU ) \n One of the unsung heroes so far for a  Sheffield United  team who have been the Premier League's surprise package. He goes about his business effectively and with the minimum of fuss. A real leader at the back. \n Caglar Soyuncu \u00a0( LEI ) \n The centre-half's attributes were perfectly summed up in  Leicester City 's 2-0 win at  Crystal Palace  earlier this month. He netted the all-important opening goal and helped keep a clean sheet with another solid and reliable defensive showing. \n Andrew Robertson \u00a0( LIV ) \n Along with  Alexander-Arnold , the Scotland international has started this season brilliantly. He shows incredible energy driving up and down the left flank and regularly weighs in with an assist. \n Fabinho \u00a0( LIV ) \n An all-action defensive midfielder whose tackling and sheer work-rate tracking back hands full-backs Alexander-Arnold and  Robertson  the licence to bomb forward. Efficient and effective in and out of possession, he is rarely drawn out of position. \n Kevin De Bruyne \u00a0( MCI ) \n The pass master supreme. On his day, and it usually is, no other player can come near his intelligent, wide range of deliveries. Sensational. \n James Maddison \u00a0( LEI ) \n The midfielder's all-round touch and technique have been outstanding. Last season he was beginning to show his quality but this year he has really blossomed under the guidance of Rodgers. \n Sadio Mane \u00a0( LIV ) \n Earned a share of the  Golden Boot  in 2018/19 and is an early contender again with seven goals so far. He is deceptively tough to knock off the ball, produces moments of outrageous skill and has pace to burn. A game changer. \n Tammy Abraham \u00a0( CHE ) \n He could and probably should have scored more! Even so, it's hard to believe this is his first full Premier League season with  Chelsea . He is handsomely repaying the trust placed in him by  Frank Lampard . \n Jamie Vardy \u00a0( LEI ) \n Vardy is just getting better and better. Although 31, he is showing no sign of slowing up and is as quick as ever. Add to that his ability to get in good positions and a clinical touch in front of goal, and you can see why he is so important to Leicester. \n Manager:  Chris Wilder \u00a0( SHU ) \n Sheff Utd have taken the Premier League by storm and that is down to Wilder's courage in sticking to his beliefs. He lets his players express themselves, which they clearly enjoy, and the benefits are there for all to see so far. \n",

By Gameweeks 4 to 5, I was Wildcarding and moving money out of the defence into attack. Now, with the wealth of value options, I feel I can pick the best of both worlds. Staying flexible would be my advice. Have a balance of template and differential picks and don't be afraid to go with your gut instinct! \n Sam Bonfield  ( @FPLFamily ):\u00a0This season I've been all about 3-4-3. In Gameweek 12, though, four at the back was definitely the way to go, with so many of the defenders getting clean sheets or attacking returns. I still favour 3-4-3, but now with more flexibility to move to 4-3-3 or 4-4-2 when needed. \n Holly Shand  ( @FFCommunity_ ): A flexible formation could be key over the coming weeks. We've got eight Gameweeks spanning 33 days so rotation is inevitable. We will need to go deep into our benches, so having substitutes you'd like to start will be important. \n Neal Thurman \u00a0( @nealjthurman ): My formation has become more top-heavy over the course of the campaign. I started the season investing in my defence and playing four defenders more often than not. As I switched to a more balanced spend in my frontline, I've moved almost exclusively to 3-4-3. \n Mark McGettigan  ( @FPLGeneral ): Nowadays, I don't really think about formation too much. I look for players across all positions who offer good value, and the formation looks after itself. I like having a flexible squad where I can vary my set-up from week to week. \n Chuck Booth \u00a0( @ChuckBoothSport ): Formation-wise, you've got to take what the Gameweek gives you but I'm set up to play 3-5-2 or 5-3-2 depending on fixtures. Never be afraid to throw defenders out there. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 FPL Lessons: Budget defenders rivalling premium options Part 2:\u00a0 FPL Lessons: Chelsea duo among best mid-price picks Part 3:  FPL Lessons:\u00a0Jimenez leads value forwards \n",

Both sides went on to finish first. \n But  Liverpool 's pursuers, and particularly  Pep Guardiola 's Man City, also have cause for optimism as they seek to battle back and lift the PL Trophy themselves. \n There have been four occasions when a team with at least an eight-point lead have been overtaken, and the Citizens have been responsible for the last two of those comebacks. \n One of the turnarounds took place last season in a similar scenario, as Guardiola's side chased down leaders Liverpool. \n City lay 10 points behind the Reds at the end of December, with a match in hand, before beating  Jurgen Klopp 's men 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium in January and finishing with 14 wins in a row to retain their title by one point. \n Watch Man City's 2011/12 finale \n \n There were echoes of 2011/12, when  Roberto Mancini 's team trailed local rivals Man Utd by eight points on 8 April but edged in front over the final six rounds of fixtures to memorably triumph on goal difference thanks to  Sergio Aguero 's stoppage-time winner against  Queens Park Rangers  on the final day. \n Arsenal  had the benefit of three matches in hand when they found themselves 11 points adrift of Man Utd in March 1998, but they nonetheless showed remarkable form to take the crown, winning 10 successive matches. \n And the greatest ever comeback came in 1995/96, when Man Utd trailed  Newcastle United  by 12 points in January, only to turn the tables and finish four points clear. \n Liverpool may have stormed into an early lead this season but history has shown that such an advantage can be eliminated in the final weeks, let alone over the remaining 26 rounds of fixtures. \n The head-to-head matches will be crucial.

        "text": "\n The Scout consults the\u00a0 FPL experts \u00a0on the key lessons they have learnt after the first 12 Gameweeks of 2019/20\u00a0 Fantasy Premier League . \n Forwards \n The prolific form of\u00a0 Jamie Vardy  (\u00a39.6m) and  Tammy Abraham \u00a0(\u00a38.0m) has helped shape the transfer plans of FPL managers. \n Vardy is the top-scoring player in the game on 92 points, thanks to his 11 goals and three assists. \n Starting at a price of \u00a39.0m, the  Leicester City  striker now resides in 35.4 per cent of squads. \n Most-owned player \n Abraham is also outscoring his premium rivals and sits second among FPL forwards on 81 points. \n Initially costing just \u00a37.0m, his 10 goals and two assists have helped him to secure a regular role for  Chelsea  under  Frank Lampard . \n That output has earned Abraham a spot in 50.6 per cent of squads, making him the most popular player in FPL. \n Meanwhile, the recent output of  Raul Jimenez  (\u00a37.3m) suggests he could be the next must-have frontman. \n The  Wolverhampton Wanderers  forward has scored three of his five goals for the season and supplied both of his assists in the last five Gameweeks. \n What the experts say \n Mark McGettigan ( @FPLGeneral ):  I invested heavily in defence and midfield in Gameweek 1 and have avoided the premium strikers up to this point. With a front three of Vardy, Abraham and Jimenez now, I don't see myself forking out \u00a310.0m+ for a forward any time soon. \n Ash ( @FPLHints ):  Despite premium forwards like  Harry Kane  (\u00a310.8m) and S ergio Aguero  (\u00a312.0m) not scoring as much of late, having three forwards has been important in recent Gameweeks, as seen with goals from Abraham, Vardy and Jimenez. \n Holly Shand ( @FFCommunity_ ) : I\u2019ve been really surprised by how poor the premium forwards have been recently. It\u2019s all been about the mid-priced assets here, with the emerging template of Vardy, Abraham and Jimenez looking like a priority. Jimenez is high on my watchlist to complete the trio. \n Sam Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ):  This season for me has been all about the death of the premium strikers. While Kane, Aguero and  Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang  (\u00a311.0m) have had good attacking returns, they don\u2019t offer the same goals-per million-returns of players such as Vardy, Abraham and  Danny Ings  (\u00a36.0m). For me, this is a great position to spend the budget economically and achieve greater points returns for your money. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ):  I went into this season completely prepared to lose that third striker spot, possibly for the whole year. I invested in big defenders and had a couple of premium midfielders, so there simply wasn\u2019t the budget to have three decent strikers. But the emergence of  Teemu Pukki  (\u00a36.7m) early on and now Abraham means you can have that forward line you\u2019ve always wanted! \n Neal Thurman ( @nealjthurman ):  I\u2019ve opted out of the high-end forward options with a steady drumbeat of Abraham, Vardy and  Callum Wilson  (\u00a37.8m), who have been just as productive, if not more so, than their higher-priced colleagues. \n Chuck Booth  (@ChuckBoothSport) : \u00a0The forward line is where my strategy has changed the most from the beginning of the season. I had three premium forwards at the start but have now transitioned to Aubameyang,  Marcus Rashford  (\u00a38.6m) and  Aaron Connolly  (\u00a34.7m) as so much value has shifted to midfield. Moving forward it will be interesting to see if the pendulum swings back to the premium options, but so far the forwards priced \u00a39.0m and under have held their own. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 FPL Lessons: Budget defenders rivalling premium options Part 2:  FPL Lessons: Chelsea duo among best mid-price picks Part 4:  FPL Lessons: Cut-price picks enable flexible formations \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout consults the\u00a0 FPL experts \u00a0on the key lessons they have learnt after the first 12 Gameweeks of 2019/20\u00a0 Fantasy Premier League . \n Midfield \n Chelsea 's strong start to the season under  Frank Lampard  has been a big help to FPL managers. \n Mason Mount  (\u00a36.8m) has emerged as a major success in his debut Premier League campaign. \n Initially costing \u00a36.0m, Mount is the seventh top-scoring midfielder with 58 points. \n Team-mate\u00a0 Christian Pulisic  (\u00a37.4m) has also caught the eye. The US international has netted five goals and 37 points in the last three Gameweeks. \n Value for money \n Mount and Pulisic's value for money comes at a time when\u00a0 Mohamed Salah  (\u00a312.3m) of  Liverpool  and  Manchester City 's\u00a0 Raheem Sterling  (\u00a312.0m) have yet to hit top form in FPL. \n Salah and Sterling were the most expensive midfielders at the start of 2019/20 costing \u00a312.5m and \u00a312.0m respectively. \n Yet both have been outscored by their less costly team-mates,  Sadio Mane  (\u00a312.1m) and  Kevin De Bruyne  (\u00a310.2m). \n Indeed, with seven of the 11 top-scoring midfielders costing under \u00a38.0m, the experts have their say on the value on offer. \n What the experts say \n Sam Bonfield  ( @FPLFamily ): Salah and Sterling just haven't yet lived up to expectations, with Mane and De Bruyne offering cheaper alternatives and higher points returns. It's the mid-price bracket in terms of midfielders that's so exciting. There are so many great options such as Pulisic, Mount,  James Maddison  (\u00a37.5m),  Youri Tielemans  (\u00a36.6m) and  Bernardo Silva  (\u00a37.9m). \n Lee Bonfield  ( @FPLFamily ): In previous seasons, I've always picked a couple of premium midfielders, a real cheap one and then two mid-priced options. I've largely stuck to that plan this year, with Liverpool and Man City assets as my premiums. I'm slowly learning, though, that maybe one is enough. There's so much value to be had at Chelsea and  Leicester City \u00a0that you don't have to burn that fifth slot. \n Holly Shand  ( @FFCommunity_ ): Midfielders have used most of my Fantasy budget this season, with three premiums over the last few weeks. The budget bracket has become deep. Mount has been great for me, but the Leicester players are quickly catching and vying for my attention. \n Ben Crabtree \u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ): There are plenty of options and a lot of temptation to move for last week's high scorers, but giving your picks around five Gameweeks might be best to ensure the most points. Perhaps have one midfield slot you rotate more often. \n Neal Thurman \u00a0( @nealjthurman ): I'm all in on the Chelsea revolution with Mount and Pulisic both cost-effective midfield options to enable Salah, De Bruyne and a solid bench option. \n FPL General  ( @FPLGeneral ): I backed Salah and Sterling for the first quarter of the season but that's changing now. Salah is gone and Sterling will follow him out of my team ahead of Gameweek 13. Mane and De Bruyne are the two I favour now with more cash spread around the squad. The fourth, or fifth, midfield spot is great as there are so many options such as\u00a0 Anthony Martial  (\u00a37.7m), Maddison, Tielemans, Mount, Pulisic and plenty more. \n Chuck Booth \u00a0( @ChuckBoothSport ): Midfield has been tricky this season as it's a position where there truly are more options than you could possibly fit into a team. Mount,  John McGinn  (\u00a35.8m)\u00a0and\u00a0 Pascal Gross  (\u00a36.4m) are strong budget candidates. Moving forward, I'm investing in the  Manchester United  attack while seeing if  Tottenham Hotspur  and  Arsenal  can improve their form so that  Son Heung-min  (\u00a39.6m) and  Nicolas Pepe  (\u00a39.2m) can become the FPL options we expected them to be. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  FPL Lessons: Budget defenders rivalling premium options Part 3:  FPL Lessons: Jimenez leads value forwards Part 4:  FPL Lessons: Cut-price picks enable flexible formations \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout consults the  FPL experts  on the key lessons they have learnt after the first 12 Gameweeks of 2019/20  Fantasy Premier League . \n Defence \n There is no doubt that  John Lundstram  (\u00a34.9m) has been the standout pick in defence in FPL this season. \n The  Sheffield United  man is the top-scoring defender on 70 points thanks to his role in midfield. \n Over 40 per cent of managers now own Lundstram, driving his price up by \u00a30.9m since the start of 2019/20. \n However, he is not the only cut-price defender the experts have turned to. \n The emergence of  Fikayo Tomori  (\u00a34.8m) and  Caglar Soyuncu  (\u00a34.9m) as first-team regulars at  Chelsea  and  Leicester City  respectively has also been a big influence. \n Tomori has started every match since Gameweek 4, while Soyuncu has been ever-present since\u00a0 Harry Maguire  (\u00a35.3m) moved to\u00a0 Manchester United . \n Bringing in such budget-friendly options has allowed the experts to retain one or two premium players in defence. \n What the experts say \n Holly Shand  ( @FFCommunity_ ) The extreme ends of the budget have seen most success, with the likes of Lundstram,  Andrew Robertson  (\u00a37.0m) and  Trent Alexander-Arnold  (\u00a37.2m) topping the charts. It's possible to fill your defence with assets under \u00a35.0m from in-form clubs like Sheffield United, Chelsea and Leicester. \n Lee Bonfield  ( @FPLFamily ) I started big at the back, then went cheap, and now I'm thinking about going big again! I think in reality a balance somewhere between the two is where I want to be. Alexander-Arnold has been, and will continue to be, a mainstay but whom I pair him with is up for grabs. A\u00a0 Liverpool  double-up is back on the cards. \n Ben Crabtree \u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ): I'm surprised by the number of great value defenders this year. Tomori and  Diego Rico  (\u00a34.3m) were priced as non-starters for their respective sides but have produced good or excellent totals so far. \n Sam Bonfield  ( @FPLFamily ): In most previous seasons, big at the back has been the way to play the game. But this term it's a whole new strategy. I've gone for three at the back, a shift from my preferred four-man defence, with one premium player (Alexander-Arnold) and four cheaper options (Tomori, Rico, Soyuncu and of course Lundstram). With Liverpool\u2019s nice fixtures there's definitely scope for the double-up with Robertson and Alexander-Arnold, but it's very hard to overlook these cheap enablers who also keep bringing in hauls. \n Neal Thurman \u00a0( @nealjthurman ): I've reduced my spending at the back significantly over the course of the season as cheaper and more productive alternatives to Robertson, Alexander-Arnold and  Lucas Digne  (\u00a35.9m) have emerged. In addition to Fantasy hero Lundstram, Rico and Soyuncu are filling out a productive budget backline for me. \n Paul Gee  ( @FPLPaulGee ): With injury concerns over\u00a0 Mohamed Salah \u00a0(\u00a312.3m) and considering Liverpool's great fixtures, it's probably wise to double up on the Reds' defence. Sheffield United and Leicester also have good fixtures, allowing Lundstram and Soyuncu to continue their excellent form. \n Ash  ( @FPLHints ): At the start of last season there was an abundance of clean sheets and attacking returns for defenders. But it's been the opposite this time around and it's been a good ride for owners of the budget-priced defenders such as Lundstram and Soyuncu. \n Mark McGettigan  ( @FPLGeneral ): I started the campaign heavy in defence with Alexander-Arnold, Robertson, Digne,  Oleksandr Zinchenko  (\u00a35.2m) and Lundstram. With great value options like Rico and Tomori emerging, I've gradually taken money out of defence. But Alexander-Arnold and Robertson have remained and will do so for the next five Gameweeks at least. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  FPL Lessons: Chelsea duo among best mid-price picks Part 3:  FPL Lessons: Jimenez leads value forwards \n",

He provided assists at home against\u00a0 Wolverhampton Wanderers  and AFC Bournemouth and scored at West Ham. \n That influence can help secure his spot in a backline which boasts the joint second-best defensive record at home this season, conceding just four goals at St James' Park. \n Allan Saint-Maximin (\u00a35.4m) \n His return from injury in Gameweek 8 has played a big part in Newcastle's improving form. \n Although Saint-Maximin has only provided one assist during that recent run, his statistics have caught the eye. \n Over the last five Gameweeks, his 10 chances created and 23 touches inside the penalty area are both team-leading totals, and no team-mate has bettered his three big chances. \n At a cost of only \u00a35.4m, he could prove a handy cut-price option for FPL midfields. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  FDR focus: Invest in fantastic Foxes Part 2:  FDR focus: Triple up on Liverpool Part 4:\u00a0 FDR focus: Schedule offers hope to Southampton Part 5:\u00a0 FDR focus: Sheff Utd defence worth double \n",

These are minimum interference for maximum benefit, maintaining the pace and tempo of Premier League football and correcting clear and obvious on-field errors. \n Clubs strongly represented the views of their supporters and agreed VAR should be under constant review.  \n Research will now take place with fans, and other relevant stakeholders, to understand their views on how the application of VAR could be best improved. \n Improvement in accuracy \n The shareholders were also updated that the introduction of VAR has improved the accuracy of match officials around \"key match incidents\" (KMI). \n Last season match officials achieved 82 per cent KMI accuracy. \n With VAR this accuracy has risen to 91 per cent this season. \n",

And now fans can relive their miraculous season in a special documentary on  YouTube . \n \"Minus 17\", which first aired on  afcbTV  back in April, was published on AFC Bournemouth's YouTube channel on Wednesday and tells the story of when they were handed a 17-point deduction while they were in League Two. \n The south-coast club were heading out of the Football League due to crippling debts and had bucket collections on match days just to stay afloat. They also turned to former player  Eddie Howe  as manager with the threat of relegation to the fifth tier of English football looming. \n In the film Howe and his assistant Jason Tindall, who are now an established Premier League management duo, join the playing squad from that season and key figures at Vitality Stadium in describing the Cherries' remarkable survival. \n The season laid the foundation for a spectacular turnaround as, under the guidance of Howe and Tindall, the Cherries rose from the fourth tier to the Premier League in six years. \n \"I have always said this was an historic moment in the club's history and it turned out to be a huge turning point from what happened afterwards,\" said Howe. \n \"It's very important that we don't forget the fabric of the club and where the club has come from. It's been a very difficult history, which makes it one of the great football stories.\" \n AFC Bournemouth are now enjoying their fifth successive top-flight campaign. \n Watch \"Minus 17\" on YouTube \n \n",

        "text": "\n Sunday's 3-1 loss at  Liverpool  extended a poor run of returns for  Manchester City 's big-hitters in  Fantasy Premier League . \n Raheem Sterling  (\u00a312.0m),  Kevin De Bruyne  (\u00a310.2m) and  Sergio Aguero  (\u00a312.0m) have struggled to maintain the output that made them popular picks at the start of the season. \n Sterling scored five goals in his first three matches but has since provided only two goals and one assist in the last nine Gameweeks. \n De Bruyne had two goals and nine assists after the first seven Gameweeks. However, the Belgian has managed only a single assist from Gameweek 8 onwards. \n And Aguero has one goal and one assist in the last six Gameweeks, compared with eight goals and two assists in the first six. \n Frustrations at the back \n Meanwhile, at the other end of the pitch, injuries to key players have lessened Man City's potential for clean sheets. \n Goalkeeper  Ederson  (\u00a36.1m) was ruled out of the trip to Anfield, joining  Aymeric Laporte  (\u00a36.3m) on the sidelines. \n Pep Guardiola 's rotation at the back has also caused issues for FPL managers. \n Apart from  Kyle Walker  (\u00a35.9m), who has started 10 Gameweeks, no other Man City defender has managed more than seven starts. \n Challenges ahead \n City's lack of form comes at a time when they are set to embark on a tough run of matches. \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), six of their next seven contests score at least three. \n That is in stark contrast to the schedules of the top two sides in the Premier League. \n Four of Liverpool's next five matches score two in the FDR, as do all five of  Leicester City 's. \n Managers must now decide whether to be patient with their Man City options or look to the top two for alternatives. \n What the experts say \n Holly Shand  ( @FFCommunity_ ): I feel over-invested in Man City with Sterling and De Bruyne. Certainly one will be going before Gameweek 13 as I look to triple up on Liverpool and Leicester assets.  Sell. \n Ash  ( @FPLHints ): It's clear Man City's defence has been severely weakened by their recent spate of injuries and their hard run of games won't help. Aguero being a rotation risk is problematic too. As for Sterling, I expect him to come good again as pressure mounts on Guardiola to get back to winning ways.  Stick. \n Neal Thurman\u00a0 ( @nealjthurman ): City seem to have taken a half-step back to being merely very good. But you're still going to want a couple of their attackers from the De Bruyne,  David Silva  (\u00a37.6m) and  Bernardo Silva  (\u00a37.9m) group.  Stick. \n Ben McNair  ( @drbenmcnair ): \u00a0Man City just played their toughest fixture so let's not overreact. On the metrics they are still far and away the most threatening attack in the league. I have kept Sterling and De Bruyne, which hurt me this week, but I think it will pay off in the coming weeks.  Stick. \n Chuck Booth \u00a0( @ChuckBoothSport ): I\u2019ve been working on shedding Man City assets. De Bruyne may be the only one worth holding if you got him into your team at his starting price of \u00a39.5m. In addition to the rotation issue their flat performances, highlighted by uncharacteristically bad finishing from Aguero, have left a bad taste in my mouth. Triple Liverpool and a single City player seems like the way to go.  Sell. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  GW12 Lessons: Watford defence providing value \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke is looking at key tactical talking points ahead of Matchweek 12.\u00a0 \n Graham Potter 's tactical revolution has breathed new life into  Brighton & Hove Albion  and rejuvenated individuals who were not considered last term. \n \n \n \n \n \n MUN \n \n \n \n \n 3 - 1 \n \n BHA \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Dan Burn  and  Steven Alzate , who both performed with distinction down the left side in last weekend\u2019s 2-0 home win over  Norwich City , fall into that category. \n They spent the bulk of last season out on loan at Wigan Athletic and Swindon Town respectively but have since grabbed their chance to shine under Potter and will be key men at  Manchester United  on Sunday. \n Progressive in possession \n At 6ft 7in, Burn does not look like a left-back, but he has taken to his new role wonderfully after switching from centre-back. \n He is comfortable moving the ball through the lines, aiming forward with an impressive 40.7 per cent of his passes, which helps Brighton\u2019s attackers get on the ball early in the final third. \n The versatile 27-year-old has also made 10 key passes and completed nine successful dribbles. \n Meanwhile, his height and defensive ability are assets out of possession. \n When the Seagulls need to defend narrowly or from set-pieces, and when Potter wants to switch to a back three, Burn can tuck in seamlessly. \n Top-ranked Brighton players 2019/20 \n \n \n \n Brighton rank \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n \n \n \n \n Clearances \n Dunk \n 37 \n Burn \n 34 \n Webster \n 28 \n \n \n Blocks \n Dunk \n 7 \n Burn \n 6 \n Webster \n 6 \n \n \n Interceptions \n Dunk \n 24 \n Stephens \n 22 \n Burn \n 18 \n \n \n Duels won \n Burn \n 73 \n Montoya \n 55 \n Propper \n 50 \n \n \n Aerial duels won \n Burn \n 37 \n Duffy \n 31 \n Webster \n 22 \n \n \n Forward passes \n Dunk \n 251 \n Burn \n 231 \n Webster \n 210 \n \n \n \n Former Leyton Orient midfielder Alzate is also impressing. \n Busy, direct and eager to get into positions where he can get shots off, the 21-year-old has shone in all three of Brighton\u2019s successive home wins. \n Last time out he played as a left midfielder, but he can also play more centrally. \n He is dangerous when drifting infield from the wing and, if he starts at Old Trafford, Man Utd's players will need to communicate well and track his runs. \n Nice selection problem \n Potter is blessed with competition for places in forward areas, though, so Alzate may be overlooked despite his outstanding display against Norwich. \n Fit-again  Leandro Trossard  is pushing hard for a place after providing a goal and two assists in his last two substitute appearances. \n Australia international  Aaron Mooy  is also available after suspension, having previously been a regular in midfield, while  Solly March  and  Glenn Murray  are ready to make an impression from the bench. \n This strength in depth has helped the Seagulls enormously in recent weeks. Indeed, no top-flight side have had more direct goal contributions from substitutes in 2019/20. \n Combined goals and assists from substitutes \n \n \n \n 2019/20 \n Total \n \n \n \n \n Brighton \n 5 \n \n \n Burnley \n \n \n Leicester \n \n \n Chelsea \n 4 \n \n \n Sheff Utd \n \n \n \n Brighton's home form has been excellent, but now they need a positive away performance. \n Since beating  Watford  3-0 on the opening weekend they have collected only one point from four matches on the road, scoring once, from a set-piece at Villa Park. \n As he seeks to improve that record at Man Utd, Potter will be seeking to select the most effective combination of attacking players from the start. \n But do not be surprised if it is one of his substitutes that makes a difference. \n Also in this series\u00a0 \n Part 2:\u00a0 Kovacic aiming to maintain influence in Jorginho's absence Part 3:\u00a0 Arsenal need settled system to keep pace with Leicester \n",

        "text": "\n A role up front for  Manchester United  has lifted  Anthony Martial 's (\u00a37.7m) potential in  Fantasy Premier League . \n The Frenchman has scored in three of his four starts in all competitions since returning from injury in late October. \n Martial's latest effort came in a 3-0 UEFA Europa League win over Partizan Belgrade at Old Trafford on Thursday evening. \n His seven per cent FPL ownership will be hoping for more goals at home to\u00a0 Brighton & Hove Albion  this weekend. \n Martial takes his place in a Scout selection that lines up in a 3-4-3 formation, with  Tammy Abraham  (\u00a37.9m) handed the armband and  Jamie Vardy  (\u00a39.4m) given the vice-captaincy. \n Nick Pope (BUR) \u00a34.7m \n At home,  Burnley 's total of three clean sheets is the joint-most in the Premier League. Pope's visitors,\u00a0 West Ham United , have failed to score in two of their last three road trips. \n Serge Aurier (TOT) \u00a34.8m \n Tottenham Hotspur 's right-back offers strong all-round potential at home to  Sheffield United . Aurier has two assists and two clean sheets in his six appearances. \n Trent Alexander-Arnold (LIV) \u00a37.2m \n His attacking potential makes the  Liverpool  right-back a likely source of points at Anfield against\u00a0 Manchester City . At home, Alexander-Arnold's 28 chances created rank joint-top among all players this season. \n Jetro Willems (NEW) \u00a34.5m \n The  Newcastle United  wing-back has averaged five points per match over his eight appearances. Willems plays\u00a0 AFC Bournemouth \u00a0at home and the Cherries have scored a single goal in the last four Gameweeks. \n Son Heung-min (TOT) \u00a39.6m \n The South Korean scored twice in the UEFA Champions League in midweek. Ahead of facing Sheff Utd, Son has four goals and an assist in his last four matches in all competitions. \n Anthony Martial (MUN) \u00a37.7m \n A consistent source of FPL points, Martial has produced attacking returns in four of his five Gameweek starts this season. \n Sadio Mane (LIV) \u00a312.0m \n Since the start of last season, the Liverpool winger has scored 21 of his 28 goals at Anfield. Mane has 32 FPL points across his last three home appearances ahead of Sunday's meeting with Man City. \n Christian Pulisic (CHE) \u00a37.3m \n The  Chelsea  midfielder has scored all four of his goals for the season in the last two Gameweeks. Pulisic is the most-bought player ahead of Friday's 19:00 GMT deadline, earning 285,000+ new owners for his match at home against\u00a0 Crystal Palace . \n Tammy Abraham (CHE) \u00a37.9m \n His total of nine big chances in home matches is more than any other player in FPL. Abraham's Chelsea host a Crystal Palace side who are without a clean sheet on their travels. \n Jamie Vardy (LEI) \u00a39.4m \n Seven goals in the last five Gameweeks have taken Vardy to the top of the FPL points standings. The  Leicester City  striker scored twice against  Arsenal  in the corresponding fixture last season. \n Raul Jimenez (WOL) \u00a37.3m \n The  Wolverhampton Wanderers  striker has returned to form with two goals and two assists in the last four Gameweeks. Wolves' visitors\u00a0 Aston Villa \u00a0have conceded a league-high 82 shots in the box away from home. \n What the experts say \n Neal Thurman  ( @nealjthurman ): I don't like Jimenez as Wolves are only great against defence-first sides, or Alexander-Arnold, who is hard to justify against Man City. I'd go  Callum Wilson  (\u00a37.9m) and  Diego Rico  (\u00a34.3m) and accept the risk of being AFC Bournemouth-heavy on the road. \n Holly Shand \u00a0( @FFCommunity_ ): I'm jealous of this front three, I'd love to own Jimenez this week. It's a great fixture for Wolves against a Villa side who concede a lot of goals and he's in great form too. \n Sam Bonfield \u00a0( @FPLFamily ): That front three is perfect. The form and fixtures look nailed on for Fantasy points, especially Vardy with eight goals in eight meetings with Arsenal, so I would have been very tempted to give him the armband over Abraham. Pulisic and Son also look great for returning points this weekend especially after Son's comments about playing to the best of his ability and working as hard as possible for both himself and  Andre Gomes  (\u00a35.3m) in light of last weekend's injury. \n Mark McGettigan \u00a0( @FPLGeneral ): I like the Willems pick, he's caught my eye in recent weeks. After making a few transfers this week, I now have the same front three. I can see Mane doing damage against Man City. \n Ben McNair \u00a0( @drbenmcnair ) : The team looks good but it looks, based on the fixtures, like a particularly unpredictable Gameweek. I think  Ashley Barnes  (\u00a36.3m) will do well this week but it's hard to argue he should replace any of the forwards in the selection. \n \n Remember to select your Gameweek 12 team before the earlier deadline of 19:00 GMT on Friday 8 November . \n \n",

We can then look to get  Jamie Vardy  (\u00a39.4m) after the break with two frees. \n Tom  ( @WGTA_FPL ): With the international break looming, it's a safety-first approach by covering the lack of a playing goalkeeper in Gameweek 13. \n Ben McNair  ( @drbenmcnair ): There was a bit of debate about our transfers this week. Hudson-Odoi is on our sell list but Mount's knock has given him a stay of execution. Upgrading our reserve 'keeper isn't a high-value transfer but it should at least make us a few points in Gameweek 13. \n Can you do better? \n Managers who want to take on the panel should enter the private classic league \"Beat the FPL Panel\". \n Join:  FPL Panel mini-league  (insert code: 3hdr4s). \n Remember to select your Gameweek 12 team before the earlier deadline of 19:00 GMT on Friday 8 November . \n",

        "text": "\n Seven goals in the last five Gameweeks have taken  Jamie Vardy  (\u00a39.4m) to the top of the  Fantasy Premier League  player standings. \n And that form has caught the eye of managers ahead of Friday's 19:00 GMT deadline. \n The  Leicester City  forward is the second most-bought player in Gameweek 12, earning over 239,000 new owners for his home encounter with  Arsenal . \n Vardy has a fine record against the north London side. \n He has eight goals in his Premier League meetings with Arsenal and scored twice in the corresponding fixture last season. \n Vardy is among the main armband contenders in a Gameweek where  Liverpool  entertain  Manchester City . \n Red-hot form\u00a0 \n Sadio Mane  (\u00a312.0m) is the form player ahead of Sunday's encounter at Anfield. \n He has racked up 32 points in his last three home matches, including two double-digit returns, and his total of 76 points is second only to Vardy's 80. \n Mohamad Salah  (\u00a312.3m) has struggled for output recently, with only one goal in his last five appearances. \n Yet the Egyptian should not be overlooked. No player has bettered his eight shots on target in the last four Gameweeks. \n \n \n \n Goals galore?\u00a0 \n Meanwhile, Liverpool's poor defensive record this season offers encouragement to owners of  Raheem Sterling  (\u00a312.1m) and  Sergio Aguero  (\u00a312.0m). \n The Reds are among only three sides who are yet to keep a clean sheet at home, along with  Norwich City  and  Southampton . \n Sterling has been Man City's main threat on the road. \n The winger has scored five of his seven goals away from home this season, and he struck in City's UEFA Champions League draw at Atalanta in midweek. \n Having featured as a late substitute in Italy, Aguero seems likely to start at Anfield. \n He has produced attacking returns in all four of his away appearances in 2019/20. \n What the experts say \n Holly Shand  ( @FFCommunity_ ): With Liverpool facing Man City, it's between  Tammy Abraham  (\u00a37.9m) and Vardy for me.  Vardy  has the higher ceiling so he gets the captaincy. \n Ash  ( @FPLHints ): Looking at current form and head-to-head records, it's  Vardy  for me. He has tended to do very well against Arsenal and is rejuvenated under  Brendan Rodgers . Arsenal have been struggling to keep clean sheets and Vardy will be up for it. \n Paul Gee  ( @FPLPaulGee ): I've got a feeling many will overlook Liverpool and Man City. Due to their poor defences, I think this will be a goal fest and I'm going with  Sterling . \n Sam Bonfield  ( @FPLFamily ): I'm going for  Harry Kane  (\u00a310.8m) again this week. He's recovered from his virus and\u00a0 Sheffield United  have conceded 16 big chances away from home this season, the second-worst record in the league. \n Ben Crabtree \u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ): Abraham has a nice fixture but I'm finding it difficult not to go for  Vardy . My decision might go to the wire. \n Mark McGettigan  ( @FPLGeneral ):  Vardy  is finally in my team and he'll get the armband on his debut. I expect Leicester to score at least twice. Abraham and  Raul Jimenez  (\u00a37.2m) are viable options too. \n Ben McNair  ( @drbenmcnair ):  I'm undecided. The bookies' odds suggest Abraham is the best choice but I haven't ruled Sterling or Mane out of my thinking yet, as neither Liverpool nor Man City look as solid defensively as last season. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  GW12 Captains: Abraham poised to deliver at home \n",

        "summary": "Draft expert Neal Thurman says Brighton winger is pushing for a starting role after impressing off the bench",
        "text": "\n We have officially entered a second phase in  Fantasy Premier League Draft . \n Gone are the heady days when\u00a0 Teemu Pukki  and  Emiliano Buendia  looked like season-long bargains, and some unexpected points-producers have emerged instead. \n Players such as  Ayoze Perez  were written off after a slow start to the season, while others like\u00a0 Christian Pulisic \u00a0who had never appeared in the Premier League initially failed to meet expectations. \n But some, for whom there were no expectations at all, have shocked by producing at exceptional levels. \n Here is a quick look at those players who are coming to the fore as we hit the waiver wire for FPL Draft games ahead of Gameweek 12. \n GKP: Tim Krul (NOR) \n I can't say I love any of the candidates who are likely to be available.  Norwich City  have locked down their defence to at least some extent and have  Watford  visiting Carrow Road, so Krul is worth a look if you're in need.  Paulo Gazzaniga  would be my second choice in a very thin pool, at\u00a0home against\u00a0 Sheffield United .\u00a0 \n DEF: Diego Rico \n Rico is surprisingly available in many of the Draft leagues I'm in, and a trip to goal-shy  Newcastle United  means he's got a chance of clean-sheet points as well as attacking returns. I'd also consider  Matt Targett , who was on fire before\u00a0 Aston Villa  ran into  Manchester City  and  Liverpool  in back-to-back Gameweeks. Visiting\u00a0 Wolverhampton Wanderers  isn\u2019t an easy fixture but I could see a 0-0 draw as Wolves struggle to break down teams that don't come at them. \n MID: Leandro Trossard (BHA) \n The  Brighton & Hove Albion  winger has reminded us all why we were excited about him at the start of the season with two extremely productive substitute appearances since returning from injury. If you think this will be the week when he returns to the starting line-up, he should be a waiver priority. If steady is more your speed then  Scott McTominay  has only missed 15 minutes all season and is a solid option. Finally,  Ryan Fraser  has to return to form at some point, doesn't he? \n FWD: Lys Mousset (SHU) \n The Sheffield United forward isn't going to be available if you wait yet another week. His 26 points over three matches will be attracting interest, even if this is just a purple patch.  Jordan Ayew  is also available in just about every eight-team league, despite his steady run of returns. \n",

And it is a similar scenario this Sunday.\u00a0 \n Yet the Reds\u00a0will be confident that the result will be different, especially at Anfield. \n Liverpool have won more Premier League matches against the defending champions than any other side, with 21 victories, and last lost to a title-holder at home in December 2007. \n They also have a strong record against Man City at Anfield, only losing one of their last 28 top-flight matches against them and none of the last 16 in the Premier League. \n Equal records \n While the leaders may have had the edge over the champions in recent Premier League meetings, their records are identical across the history of the competition. \n There have been 34 such matches overall and\u00a016 have been drawn, while there have been nine wins apiece. \n The fine margins are underlined by the fact that only four such matches have been decided by more than a single goal. \n The biggest victory came in October 2011, when first-placed Man City won 6-1 at a\u00a0 Manchester United \u00a0side who were defending their crown. \n That ended up being the closest-ever title race, though, with City ending up finishing ahead of their local rivals on goal difference. \n That secured the first of City's four Premier League titles. But a fifth, and a third in succession, would become a taller order if they were to slip nine points behind Liverpool with a defeat at Anfield this weekend. \n \"It was always going to be a huge game,\" says  Michael Owen , who scored 150 Premier League goals for Liverpool. \"It's a bigger game now for Manchester City.\u00a0 \n \"If they lost then that points gap is a very big one.

It stifled the energetic style that  Jurgen Klopp 's team have become renowned for. \n A Liverpool win this weekend would leave Man City nine points behind in the race for the title, so with so much at stake we could witness another watchful performance from the title-holders. \n Taming Liverpool\u2019s aggression \n Guardiola knows Liverpool are ferocious opponents, especially on home turf. \n Aggressive in the way they press and win tackles inside the opposition half, it is vital for all visiting sides to focus hard on not losing the ball in bad areas. \n Many opponents struggle to handle them on Merseyside. \n When you consider Liverpool average 60.8 per cent possession in matches at Anfield, their ball-winning stats are incredibly impressive. \n For a side who have so much of the ball, they also win it back with high levels of efficiency. \n Home matches this season \n \n \n \n Most poss. won final third \n Most tackles won \n \n \n \n \n Liverpool \n 41 \n Everton \n 79 \n \n \n Southampton \n 39 \n Brighton \n 68 \n \n \n Man City \n 37 \n Liverpool \n 66 \n \n \n Crystal Palace \n Sheff Utd \n \n \n Arsenal \n Leicester \n \n \n \n So Man City will aim to take away this strength of their opponents. \n Last season they were relatively risk-free in their choice of distribution and showed wonderful discipline in their choice of pass. \n It will be fascinating to see if one of the world\u2019s most adventurous passing sides can again replicate that tactic. \n The side to watch \n Important duels will take place all over the pitch but one specific area draws extra interest. \n With the attack-minded  Benjamin Mendy  or rare starter\u00a0 Angelino  the options for Man City at left-back, I anticipate Liverpool targeting that position as a possible weakness. \n Coupled with that,  Trent Alexander-Arnold  and  Jordan Henderson  have been dominant working in tandem down the Reds' right in recent outings. \n With  Mohamed Salah  drifting inside, the England team-mates pushed forward with force in back-to-back comeback wins over  Aston Villa  and  Tottenham Hotspur . \n Considering he is a right-back, it is exceptional that across the\u00a0last 180 minutes of top-flight action Alexander-Arnold has made 38 more entries to the penalty area than any other Liverpool player. \n Together, he and Henderson have been excellent. \u00a0 \n If they impose themselves in a similar way this weekend, it could make the difference. \n Liverpool's last two matches \n \n \n \n Most penalty-area entries \n Most open-play crosses \n \n \n \n \n Alexander-Arnold \n 56 \n Alexander-Arnold \n 22 \n \n \n Henderson \n 18 \n Henderson \n 10 \n \n \n Mane \n 12 \n Robertson \n \n \n Robertson \n 9 \n Mane \n 8 \n \n \n Fabinho \n 7 \n Firmino \n 2 \n \n \n \n Will the Reds apply the handbrake? \n There is one caveat to consider, and that is Man City's own strength down that side of the pitch. \n David Silva  and  Raheem Sterling  have both been in exceptional form themselves. \n If the former is passed fit then their twin threat could curtail Alexander-Arnold and Henderson's ambition in attack. \n If they take unnecessary risks and holes appear for City's talismen to hurt them on the break, it could spell trouble. \n Keep your eye on where Alexander-Arnold and Henderson take the majority of their touches at Anfield this Sunday. \n If it is in the middle third that will be a sign of how well Guardiola's game plan is working. \n Also in this series\u00a0 \n Part 1:\u00a0 Burn at the heart of Potter's Brighton revolution Part 2:\u00a0 Kovacic aiming to maintain influence in Jorginho's absence Part 3:  Arsenal need settled system to keep pace with Leicester \n",

        "text": "\n After 11 Gameweeks of 2019/20,  Sadio Mane  (\u00a312.0m) is the top-scoring midfielder in  Fantasy Premier League . \n The winger made the difference in\u00a0 Liverpool 's 2-1 comeback victory at\u00a0 Aston Villa , scoring a late winner and supplying an assist. \n Mane claimed 12 points at Villa Park, his fourth double-figure haul of the campaign. \n Match Mane's impact at Villa \n \n His display was in stark contrast to the output of a number of premium midfielders in Gameweek 11. \n Mane's team-mate  Mohamed Salah  (\u00a312.3m) was withdrawn in the 65th minute at Villa Park, returning only two points. He has one goal and one assist in the last six Gameweeks. \n Manchester City  duo  Raheem Sterling  (\u00a312.1m) and  Kevin De Bruyne  (\u00a310.2m) were also major disappointments. \n The most-selected captain in Gameweek 11, Sterling returned only a single point at home against\u00a0 Southampton . \n Having started the season with five goals in Man City's first three fixtures, he has only two goals and one assist in the last eight Gameweeks. \n De Bruyne has also suffered a drop in form, with only one assist from Gameweek 8 onwards. \n Strong fixtures after City duel \n Mane's impact against Villa highlights an improvement in his all-round FPL potential. \n He has scored six goals and also supplied four assists, already bettering his total of three assists from 2018/19. \n A home encounter with Man City this weekend may deter many managers from bringing in the Liverpool winger. \n But the Reds' schedule from Gameweek 13 onwards gives Mane the chance to maintain his momentum. \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), four of their subsequent five matches score only two. \n That run also raises the appeal of Salah, offering managers a strong double-up option before Liverpool's blank Gameweek 18. \n What the experts say \n Paul Gee  ( @FPLPaulGee ): You can't ignore Mane. But by the time Liverpool start their kind run of fixtures Salah is going to be a differential, with only 27.8 per cent ownership now and hopefully with his ongoing ankle issues sorted out. \n Holly Shand  ( @FFCommunity_ ): It seemed a tough decision a couple of weeks ago to make the move from Salah to Mane but I haven't looked back. Salah could be hampered by injury for some time so the switch looks logical and, with Man City having a tough run of matches ahead, a move from one of their midfielders to Mane could be viable too. \n Sam Bonfield  ( @FPLFamily ): As a Salah owner, Mane's form is really starting to hurt. Mane is the premium asset to own right now and, with Salah's ankle still causing him issues, the switch to Mane is definitely on. \n Lee Bonfield  ( @FPLFamily ): A move to Mane looks a safe bet ahead of a great run of Liverpool fixtures. Mane was FPL's top scorer until  Jamie Vardy \u00a0(\u00a39.4m) scored his late goal at Selhurst Park and again looked dangerous against Villa. I have him in my team and he's a genuine captaincy option most weeks after the Man City clash. \n Ben Crabtree \u00a0( @FC_CrabDogg ): Mane looks the best premium option at the moment, including forwards. But I feel Sterling sellers will soon have regrets, even though his fixtures are becoming more difficult. \n Mark McGettigan  ( @FPLGeneral ): My midfield let me down in Gameweek 11, scoring only seven points! It's time for a bit of a shake-up in that area. Either Salah or Sterling could go this week to accommodate Vardy up front. If Salah goes, Mane will come in after the Man City fixture. He's the Liverpool midfielder I want long term. \n Neal Thurman \u00a0( @nealjthurman ): It's hard to justify switching back and forth between Salah and Mane as each go through ups and downs in form. I'd pick one and stick with him unless there's an injury. if you're choosing now, I'd start with Mane. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Ben McNair  ( @drbenmcnair ) : I baulked a little at Mane\u2019s price at the start of the season, but with 20 league goals already this calendar year he's justified the price tag. Salah still has the advantage of taking penalties but seems to be below his best. Perhaps it\u2019s his troublesome ankle or the extra attention he seems to get from opponents, but Salah can\u2019t match Mane\u2019s goal threat from open play this season. \n \n Also in this series \n Part 1:\u00a0 GW11 Lessons: Resilient Blades a gift for FPL managers \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n",

        "text": "\n A fourth double-digit haul of the season has lifted  Sadio Mane  (\u00a311.9m) to the top of the  Fantasy Premier League  points table. \n The  Liverpool  winger scored the winning goal in his side's 2-1 victory at  Aston Villa , after setting up the equaliser for\u00a0 Andrew Robertson \u00a0(\u00a36.9m). \n Mane now has four assists this season, surpassing his total of three from 2018/19, and his 12-point haul at Villa Park has taken his overall figure to\u00a076 points.\u00a0 \n Biggest score of the season \n However, it was  John Lundstram  (\u00a34.7m) who was the standout player from Saturday\u2019s eight matches. \n The  Sheffield United  defender combined two goals and a clean sheet with the maximum three bonus points against  Burnley . \n That helped Lundstram collect 21 points, the highest individual FPL haul in 2019/20. \n He is the top-value player in the game, returning 14.5 points per million (ppm). \n Lundstram's team-mate  Lys Mousset  (\u00a34.9m) also impressed with a hat-trick of assists against the Clarets. \n In-form forwards\u00a0 \n Elsewhere up front,  Raul Jimenez  (\u00a37.2m) and  Tammy Abraham  (\u00a37.9m) maintained their strong recent form. \n Jimenez took his tally to two goals and two assists in the last four Gameweeks by scoring\u00a0 Wolverhampton Wanderers \u2019 equaliser in a 1-1 draw at  Arsenal . \n And his schedule raises the prospects of further big hauls. \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), Wolves' next five opponents score no more than three. \n Abraham scored once and supplied an assist in  Chelsea \u2019s win at  Watford \u00a0to claim 12 points. \n Hot streak\u00a0 \n His team-mate\u00a0 Christian Pulisic  (\u00a37.2m), meanwhile, is now the co-leader of the FPL form table, alongside Lundstram. \n The US international took his tally to four goals in two Gameweeks by scoring the visitors' second at Vicarage Road. \n And there was plenty of joy for FPL defenders in Gameweek 11, with  Kyle Walker  (\u00a35.9m),  Martin Montoya  (\u00a34.5m) and  Adam Smith  (\u00a34.3m) all joining Lundstram in registering double-digit hauls. \n Smith's  AFC Bournemouth  side have now kept three successive clean sheets ahead of a trip to  Newcastle United . \n Back with a bang\u00a0 \n Montoya's  Brighton & Hove Albion  team-mate  Leandro Trossard  (\u00a35.8m) was a major differential in midfield. \n The winger supplied a goal and an assist in a 2-0 home win over  Norwich City . \n Owned by just 0.3 per cent, Trossard has provided 15 points in two appearances since returning from injury in Gameweek 10. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  GW11 stats: Frustration high as top-pick Sterling blanks Part 3:  GW11 bonus points: Maddison and Soyuncu shine \n",

Members of the Royal Signals will be flagbearers for the match, while a\u00a0bugler will play The Last Post.\u00a0 \n At Villa Park there will be fun zone activity with the Armed Forces, while 10 military personnel will be welcomed by a guard of honour made by  Aston Villa  and  Liverpool 's players prior to kick-off, with a special flag display organised by fan group ProjectB6. \n A poppy banner will adorn the centre circle at Etihad Stadium, where the poem\u00a0\"Ode to Remembrance\" will be read out by the club chaplain as the reigning Premier League champions prepare to host  Southampton . \n After a rendition of The Last Post,\u00a0the  Manchester City  Veterans football team will be welcomed on to the pitch, having marched to the stadium to raise money for  City in the Community . \n Bid for signed first-team shirts \n As in previous years, players will be wearing special-edition shirts featuring\u00a0embroidered poppies. \n The match-worn shirts will then be signed and made available for purchase in an auction after the match, with all proceeds going to  The Royal British Legion . \n Fans can register their interest in the auctions at the  Premier League's Poppy page , where updates of the auctions will also be provided. \n The Premier League has been supporting the Legion since 2012 and, through the auctioning of these match-worn shirts, has helped to raised \u00a31.6million for the charity.\u00a0 \n This money will help the Legion offer support in many ways including providing crisis grants, lobbying the government on issues that affect the Armed Forces community, providing sport and art-based recovery programmes and advising on benefits and money problems.\u00a0 \n \n \n \"The Legion\u2019s work is entirely dependent on the public\u2019s generous support\" \n \n Claire Rowcliffe, Royal British Legion \n \n \n \n \"We are extremely grateful for the support the Premier League clubs and the football community show the Poppy Appeal every year,\" said Claire Rowcliffe, director of fundraising at The Royal British Legion. \n \"The Legion\u2019s work is entirely dependent on the public\u2019s generous support \u2013 so please wear your poppy with pride, knowing you have made\u00a0 a real difference to the lives of servicemen and women, veterans and their loved ones.\" \n See:\u00a0 The Royal British Legion Shirt Auction \n",

        "summary": "Hornets have yet to lose this season when Belgian starts as Adrian Clarke highlights how Quique Sanchez Flores has transformed their defence",
        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke is looking at key tactical talking points ahead of Matchweek 11.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n WAT \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 2 \n \n CHE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n On the evidence of their last three matches  Quique Sanchez Flores  has successfully plugged the holes in  Watford \u2019s leaky defence. \n Conceding only once over that time, compared with 20 goals in their opening seven matches, the Hornets have made dramatic improvements in their work off the ball. \n Why such a transformation? \n Altering Watford\u2019s shape, mindset and philosophy in the most pronounced way possible, Sanchez Flores has performed one of the most distinct tactical revamps in recent memory. \n A recall for Kabasele \n First of all, the Spaniard\u2019s decision to add an extra defender has shored up the backline. \n Instantly moving away from  Javi Gracia \u2019s favoured 4-2-2-2, Sanchez Flores had tinkered with 4-2-3-1, 4-5-1 and 4-3-3 formations in his opening three fixtures. \n He has since settled on a 5-3-2, bringing the experienced  Christian Kabasele  back into his starting XI. \n The Belgian has been excellent, and something of a lucky charm. \n With Kabasele in the starting line-up this season, Watford have enjoyed significantly better results. \n Kabasele's impact on Watford \n \n \n \n 2019/20 \n Not starting \n Starting \n \n \n \n \n Matches \n 5 \n 5 \n \n \n Defeats \n 5 \n 0 \n \n \n Goals conceded/match \n 3.4 \n 0.8 \n \n \n Points/match \n 0 \n 1 \n \n \n \n The move to a 5-3-2, with a clear focus on getting 10 or 11 men behind the ball when out of possession, has made the Hornets tougher to break down. \n With a more compact team in front of him, Watford goalkeeper  Ben Foster  has faced 3.3 shots on target during the last three matches. \n Prior to that, the season average had been 5.3 efforts per 90. \n So the bottom-placed side can approach this weekend\u2019s test against  Chelsea  boosted by successive clean sheets at Vicarage Road. \n Taking a direct route \n Under Gracia Watford had developed into a pretty passing side who were comfortable in possession. \n Having tried to build on that style when he took charge for his second stint at the club in Matchweek 5, Sanchez Flores has since ripped up the blueprint and started afresh. \n Setting up in a much deeper block, the Hornets now prefer to sacrifice the ball and look to threaten opponents on the counter-attack. \n In a matter of weeks Watford's style has changed beyond recognition. \n Considering that two of their last three Premier League matches have been at home to  Sheffield United  and  AFC Bournemouth , the statistics below tell the story of a radical change in attitude. \n When Chelsea visit on Saturday, Watford will release a lot of long passes into the wide channels for their forwards to chase. \n They will try to play a percentage game. \n How Watford's style has changed \n \n \n \n Matchweeks \n 1-4 \n 5-7 \n 8-10 \n \n \n \n \n Ave. possession \n 52.4 \n 48.0 \n 36.5 \n \n \n Passes/90 \n 441 \n 488 \n 336 \n \n \n Long passes/90 \n 55 \n 50 \n 64 \n \n \n Pass accuracy \n 78.1% \n 84.6% \n 70.4% \n \n \n \n Watford have scored only five goals this season and have the competition's worst shot-conversion rate of 5.6 per cent. \n Injuries to  Troy Deeney  and  Danny Welbeck  have not helped, while  Andre Gray  has struggled for form and netted once. \n So during their last two outings, Sanchez Flores has instead used wingers  Gerard Deulofeu  and  Roberto Pereyra  as his twin strikeforce. \n They boast good skill and movement, but neither is a clinical finisher accustomed to making centre-forward-type runs. \n When crosses come into the box they pose less threat than natural strikers, and this has been a problem for the team. \n Sanchez Flores did his best to play an attacking brand of football at the outset, but this major tactical shift has not improved them inside the final third. \n Spending less time in advanced areas, they have scored only once in the last five matches. \n Watford's attacking stats per 90 mins \n \n \n \n Matchweeks \n 1-4 \n 5-7 \n 8-10 \n \n \n \n \n Shots \n 13.8 \n 16.7 \n 7.3 \n \n \n Shots on target \n 2.8 \n 6.3 \n 2.3 \n \n \n Touches in opp. box \n 26.5 \n 27.7 \n 14.0 \n \n \n Possess. won in final third \n 3.8 \n 7.7 \n 2.0 \n \n \n \n An in-form Chelsea should dominate territory against a more pragmatic Watford side. \n They arrive as the most free-scoring away team in the Premier League, too, registering 16 goals on their last four road trips. \n So to hold out against the Blues, and provide enough of a goal threat at the other end of the pitch, this new-look Watford side will need to play extremely well to claim a first Premier League victory of the campaign. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:\u00a0 Stability the secret of Palace and Leicester success Part 3:\u00a0 Everton have blueprint in place to beat Spurs Part 4:\u00a0 Wing play key to Cherries joy against Man Utd \n",

The England international has had only one shot on target from three attempts in his last 254 minutes. \n Wide of the mark \n AFC Bournemouth were 2018/19 top scorers outside of the teams who finished in the top six last season. \n Strong from set-pieces, clinical on the counter-attack, and lethal from crosses sent into the box, the Cherries had a variety of ways of scoring their 56 goals. \n So far in 2019/20 they have retained their potency from corners and free-kicks, scoring six of their 13 goals from set-plays, and still look dangerous on the break. \n But out wide it is a different story. \n Ryan Fraser  was one of the stars of the previous campaign, delivering an impressive 58 key passes. \n The winger sent 34 successful crosses into the box from open play, the fourth-highest individual total, but he has been below par this term. \n Missing the Scot\u2019s influence, as well as that of the injured  David Brooks , AFC Bournemouth\u2019s service from the flanks has fallen. \n Fewest succ. open-play crosses \n \n \n \n Club \n Total \n \n \n \n \n Norwich City \n 9 \n \n \n AFC Bournemouth \n 13 \n \n \n Crystal Palace \n 14 \n \n \n Man Utd \n 16 \n \n \n Southampton \n 17 \n \n \n \n Left-back  Diego Rico  has enjoyed some promising moments but Fraser,  Joshua King  and loan signing  Harry Wilson  have delivered only four accurate crosses between them from open play. \n The team who produced the fourth-most accurate crosses in the competition last season need to address this decline. \n Callum Wilson is terrific at converting balls flashed across the face of goal but has had precious few opportunities. \n Better on the break \n If Man Utd dominate possession at Vitality Stadium it will suit the Cherries, who have proven to be dangerous as a counter-attacking side. \n Their style has evolved every season since their first in the Premier League, in 2015/16, but the most recent pattern has been to spend less time on the ball. \n From 2017/18 to now, their average possession has dipped from 48 per cent to 46 per cent to 44 per cent. \n Interestingly, their best performances during the last couple of months have been in matches where they have sat back and caught their opponents on the break. \n Their three Premier League victories this season have all come in contests where they had their least amount of possession. \n AFC Bournemouth's lowest possessions \n \n \n \n 2019/20 match \n Possession \n \n \n \n \n BOU 1-3 MCI \n 26.2% \n \n \n SOU 1-3 BOU \n 36.2% \n \n \n AVL 1-2 BOU \n 37.4% \n \n \n BOU 3-1 EVE \n 40.5% \n \n \n \n Man Utd travel to the south coast buoyed by three successive away wins in all competitions at Partizan,\u00a0 Norwich City  and  Chelsea . They will want to take control of the match. \n AFC Bournemouth will be a considerable threat on the counter and from set-pieces, but to claim only a second Premier League win over the Red Devils, Howe\u2019s men will probably need to show a wider range of creativity. \n Until they rediscover their form down the flanks it feels like consistent goalscoring will be harder to come by than it was last season. \n Also in this series\u00a0 \n Part 1:\u00a0 Kabasele helping Watford rebuild from the back Part 2:\u00a0 Stability the secret of Palace and Leicester success Part 3:  Everton have blueprint in place to beat Spurs \n",

        "summary": "Left-back one of three players from champions to earn place in best Gameweek 11 line-up captained by Raheem Sterling",
        "text": "\n A home encounter with  Southampton  boosts the all-round points potential of  Benjamin Mendy  (\u00a35.9m) and  Manchester City 's star players in  Fantasy Premier League . \n Having recovered from injury, left-back Mendy has started the last two Gameweeks and claimed a clean sheet on both occasions. \n His runs forward will also trouble a Saints side who have struggled to cope with attacking left-backs this season. \n Ben Chilwell  (\u00a35.6m) produced 19 points in  Leicester City \u2019s 9-0 Gameweek 10 win at St Mary's Stadium, while  Marcos Alonso  (\u00a36.3m) and  Diego Rico  (\u00a34.2m) have also provided attacking returns against Southampton. \n Mendy takes his place in a Gameweek 11 Scout Selection that lines up in a 3-5-2 formation, with  Raheem Sterling  (\u00a312.1m) handed the armband and  Mohamed Salah  (\u00a312.4m) given the vice-captaincy. \n Mat Ryan (BHA) \u00a34.7m \n The third highest-scoring goalkeeper in FPL has produced 28 points in the last five Gameweeks.  Brighton & Hove Albion \u00a0are at home against\u00a0 Norwich City , who have scored a single away goal this season. \n Benjamin Mendy (MCI) \u00a35.9m \n The left-back produced four assists in his five home appearances last season. \n Trent Alexander-Arnold (LIV) \u00a37.2m \n A trip to  Aston Villa  boosts his chances of points at both ends of the pitch. Alexander-Arnold has a goal, an assist and two clean sheets in  Liverpool \u2019s last four away matches. \n Enda Stevens (SHU) \u00a35.0m \n The  Sheffield United  wing-back sits in only 1.7 per cent of squads ahead of a home match against\u00a0 Burnley . Stevens has been a consistent source of returns, supplying an assist or a clean sheet in six of the last nine Gameweeks. \n Raheem Sterling (MCI) \u00a312.1m \n His match against Saints can make Sterling the most-selected captain for the second Gameweek in a row. The Man City winger scored twice and supplied two assists in a 6-1 win in this fixture last term. \n Mohamed Salah (LIV) \u00a312.4m \n The Egyptian has upped his goal threat in recent matches. Salah has recorded nine shots on target over the last four Gameweeks, more than any other player in FPL. \n David Silva (MCI) \u00a37.7m \n Man City\u2019s playmaker has been a huge success in matches at Etihad Stadium this season. Silva has two goals, three assists and 33 points in his four home starts. \n Andriy Yarmolenko (WHU) \u00a36.0m \n The  West Ham United  winger has averaged seven points per home appearance this season. Yarmolenko plays a  Newcastle United  side who have conceded 12 goals in five away matches. \n Anthony Martial (MUN) \u00a37.6m \n The fit-again Frenchman has produced attacking returns in all four of his Gameweek starts for  Manchester United . Over 83,000 managers have bought Martial in for his visit to  AFC Bournemouth . \n Tammy Abraham (CHE) \u00a37.8m \n A trip to  Watford  hands the  Chelsea  forward a chance to extend his strong away form. Six of Abraham\u2019s eight goals and 41 of his 61 points have come in away matches this season. \n Neal Maupay (BHA) \u00a36.0m \n Brighton\u2019s forward has been a reliable source of goals in recent home matches, scoring in each of his last three at the Amex Stadium. Maupay can extend that run against a Norwich defence with a single clean sheet this season. \n What the experts say \n Lee Bonfield \u00a0( @FPLFamily ): A great mix of popular picks and differentials. Playing as Man Utd's No 9 and with some favourable fixtures, Martial should reward brave managers if he can stay fit.\u00a0 \n Sam Bonfield \u00a0( @FPLFamily ): Sterling, Salah and Silva were all rested in the EFL Cup in midweek. With Mendy looking likely to play as a result of Man City's injuries, Sterling will not be having to go as wide and is therefore a fantastic captain option. \n Mark McGettigan \u00a0( @FPLGeneral ): Great picks this week but I would have opted for  John Lundstram  (\u00a34.7m) over Stevens. I'm hoping Maupay delivers for me again this week. I thought  Jamie Vardy  (\u00a39.3m) would be in after his heroics last week but I do think  Crystal Palace  could keep him quiet. \n Ben McNair \u00a0( @drbenmcnair ) : Maupay looks a fantastic pick against a leaky Norwich defence. It\u2019s a nice situation for his owners since Brighton\u2019s upcoming fixtures are likely to put non-owners off buying him. \n Holly Shand \u00a0( @FFCommunity_ ): Triple Man City is a must this week. I\u2019m excited to see if Mendy can exploit Saints down the left to the same degree that Leicester\u2019s Chilwell did. Sterling looks set to bring in big captaincy points. \n Ash \u00a0( @FPLHints ): The inclusion of Martial seems right. Provided he is back to full fitness, he could wreak havoc upon AFC Bournemouth's backline. I also think that Maupay could run riot against Norwich. He is a bandwagon waiting to happen. \n Paul Gee \u00a0( @FPLPaulGee ): I love the five-man midfield selection, especially Martial. With such a low ownership, he is a strong alternative to the usual high-owned options. \n",

        "text": "\n More than 141,000\u00a0 Fantasy Premier League  managers\u00a0might rue selling\u00a0 Callum Wilson  (\u00a37.9m) for Gameweek 11. \n The  AFC Bournemouth  forward has suffered a loss of form after a strong start to the season. \n Wilson produced a goal or an assist in each of the first seven Gameweeks. \n But he has drawn blanks in three successive matches ahead of a visit from\u00a0 Manchester United . \n Man Utd problems \n However, injuries in Man Utd's defence can revive Wilson's potential in FPL. \n Both their first-choice centre-backs,  Harry Maguire  (\u00a35.4m) and  Victor Lindelof  (\u00a35.4m), picked up knocks in the midweek win over  Chelsea  in the EFL Cup. \n The pair are now in a race to be fit for Saturday. \n In addition,  Ole Gunnar Solskjaer 's side have lacked resilience on the road this season. They have failed to keep a clean sheet away from home. \n More cause for optimism \n Wilson's underlying statistics suggest he still boasts a significant goal threat when playing at Vitality Stadium. \n At home,\u00a0his total of seven big chances is joint-second with  Mohamed Salah  (\u00a312.4m) among all players in FPL.\u00a0 \n The Cherries' upcoming schedule also raises the prospect of keeping faith in Wilson. \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), three of AFC Bournemouth's subsequent four opponents over Gameweeks 12 to 15 score just two. \n That hands Wilson another chance to get back among the goals, rewarding the patience of his remaining 12.3 per cent ownership.\u00a0 \n Also in this series\u00a0 \n Part 2:\u00a0 FPL team news: Sigurdsson back as an option \n",

        "summary": "The Scout says Everton midfielder who is strong at home is set to be recalled to the starting XI against a leaky Spurs defence",
        "text": "\n The  Fantasy Premier League  prospects of  Gylfi Sigurdsson  (\u00a37.5m) could be set for a revival in\u00a0 Everton \u2019s home match with  Tottenham Hotspur . \n After starting the first eight Gameweeks, the Iceland international was dropped to the bench against  West Ham United  and  Brighton & Hove Albion . \n But an injury to winger  Bernard  (\u00a36.5m) can allow Sigurdsson to return to the starting line-up to face Spurs on Sunday. \n The playmaker could occupy the central-support role in  Marco Silva \u2019s 4-2-3-1 formation, with  Alex Iwobi  (\u00a35.8m) moving to the left flank. \n Top-four home creator \n Despite his role as a substitute against the Hammers in Gameweek 9, Sigurdsson still came off the bench to score his side\u2019s second goal in a 2-0 win. \n The underlying numbers further highlight his impact at Goodison Park. \n At home, his 16 chances created are a team-leading figure. Only three other players have bettered that total this season. \n That creativity can help the hosts take advantage of Spurs' poor away form. \n Mauricio Pochettino 's men have conceded two or more goals in all five of their 2019/20 road trips. \n Now down to 3.4 per cent ownership, that marks Sigurdsson out as intriguing midfield differential for FPL managers in Gameweek 11. \n Also in this series\u00a0 \n Part 1:  FPL team news: Injuries suggest keeping Wilson \n",
