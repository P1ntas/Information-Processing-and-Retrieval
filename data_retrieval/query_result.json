The Brazilian will meet  a Swansea City side  that have conceded at least three goals in seven of their last nine outings. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Junior Stanislas - AFC Bournemouth - £5.2m \n A converted spot-kick at Hull City in Gameweek 21 took the Cherries winger to four goals and six assists in his last 10 starts. The  visit from an out-of-sorts Watford  offers Stanislas a platform to maintain that form. \n Zlatan Ibrahimovic - Manchester United - £11.6m \n With a goal or an assist in nine of his last 10 Gameweek starts, the consistent Swede is an FPL mainstay that just cannot be overlooked ahead of  a trip to Stoke City . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Romelu Lukaku - Everton - £9.6m \n Three goals in the last four Gameweeks marks a return to form for the Toffees frontman, sparking a flurry of FPL transfer interest ahead of the Gameweek 22  visit to Crystal Palace . The Eagles backline has kept only a single shutout this season and may struggle to contain an Everton side that has scored seven goals from their last two outings. \n Salomon Rondon - West Bromwich Albion - £6.8 \n Like McAuley, the Venezuelan striker will pose a major threat to visitors Sunderland in the air. Having already scored a hat-trick of headers against Swansea City this season, Rondon has proved his ability to punish defences at The Hawthorns. \n",

        "text":"\n Following a 49-point return from Gameweek 13, only three points above the average, the Scout Selection is looking to an array of differential picks to deliver an improvement. \n Only two of our chosen XI boasts an ownership of over 20%, as we revisit some former FPL favourites with fixtures and form in their favour. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Lee Grant  (Stoke City) £4.1m  A clean sheet at Watford last time out and his prospects look strong again for this weekend.  Opponents Burnley  have scored a single goal on the road this season, registering the fewest goal attempts of any side (31). \n Gareth McAuley  (West Bromwich Albion) £4.8m With three goals to his name, McAuley combines goal threat with clean-sheet potential  at home to Watford . The Hornets arrive having scored five goals in their last six following a disappointing 1-0 reverse to Stoke City. \n Ben Gibson  (Middlesbrough) £4.7m The Middlesbrough skipper is our go-to option for a Riverside Stadium meeting with Hull City. Aitor Karanka's defence has shown improvement of late, with only four goals conceded in as many matches. \n Virgil van Dijk  (Southampton) £5.5m The Dutchman leads a Saints' back four  at Crystal Palace  that has conceded only a single goal in their last four matches in all competitions, including back-to-back Premier League clean sheets. The Eagles pose a threat but only eight of their 21 goals have arrived on home turf. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Alexis Sanchez  (Arsenal) £11.4m With five goals on his travels this season, Sanchez looks set to spearhead the Arsenal attack  at the London Stadium , against a West Ham United defence without a clean sheet in the last four Gameweeks, conceding seven goals. \n Christian Eriksen  (Tottenham Hotspur) £8.1m The Dane fired his first goal of the campaign last weekend, having topped the charts for goal attempts from midfield over the last six Gameweeks.  Opponents Swansea City  have allowed 14 goals over their previous six, with a single clean sheet in eight. \n Sadio Mane  (Liverpool) £9.2m Philippe Coutinho 's (£8.5m) injury has us turning to an alternative in the Liverpool midfield ahead of  a trip to AFC Bournemouth . Mane has hit five of his six goals at Anfield but, as the Reds' leading scorer, he has our backing against a Cherries rearguard that conceded twice to Sunderland in their last home outing. \n Dimitri Payet  (West Ham United) £9.2m   With 46 chances created, the Frenchman is the Premier League's most creative player and will be pivotal to the Hammers' ambitions in the  derby meeting with Arsenal . The Gunners have injury concerns at right-back and may struggle to contain Payet's influence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Jermain Defoe  (Sunderland) £7.6m With three goals in his last four Gameweeks, Defoe will likely renew his partnership with Victor Anichebe (£4.6m). That pair will face  a Leicester City defence  that has shipped 16 away goals and are yet to keep a clean sheet on the road. \n Harry Kane  (Tottenham Hotspur) £10.9m Currently on his best Premier League scoring streak having notched in four of his last five outings, Kane will take  on Swansea City  fresh from signing a new contract at White Hart Lane. He was a shoo-in for the weekend and will be our Gameweek 14 captain. \n Alvaro Negredo  (Middlesbrough) £6.3m We revisit the Spanish striker following his impressive brace at Leicester City last weekend.  Monday night's visitors Hull City  have not kept a clean sheet since Gameweek 2 and have allowed 14 goals in their last six matches. \n",

        "text":"\n Sadio Mane 's (£9.4m) hamstring injury could persuade more  Fantasy Premier League  managers to look to  Philippe Coutinho  (£9.0m). \n With two goals and an assist in the last two Gameweeks, the Brazilian has earned 92,000+ new owners ahead of Saturday's 11:30 BST deadline. \n Interest could now escalate following Mane's setback. \n The winger is ruled out of Saturday's meeting with  Manchester United  and could be sidelined for up to six weeks with the injury sustained on international duty with Senegal. \n Coutinho retreated to a central midfield role at  Newcastle United  in Gameweek 7 but could now shift to the left of  Jurgen Klopp 's front three. \n Since returning to action in Gameweek 5, he has produced more shots (17) and key passes (14) than any other player. \n Mane's absence will also allow  Roberto Firmino  (£8.5m) to push for a return to the starting XI. \n He dropped to the bench for the first time this season against the Magpies. \n Firmino's recent lack of points - with only one goal in six Gameweeks - has led to over 132,000 sales. \n Renewed interest in  Liverpool  options could soon be driven by an improving schedule of fixtures. \n From Gameweek 10, seven of their subsequent nine opponents score only two in the  Fixture Difficulty Rankings  (FDR). \n But FPL managers should be wary of the impact of Mane's absence on Liverpool's attack. \n The winger recently missed Gameweeks 5 and 6 through suspension. \n During those matches, against  Burnley  and  Leicester City , Klopp's men created fewer big chances - or chances where the receiving player should score. \n Having recorded 3.2 big chances per match in Gameweeks 1-4, this fell to only 1.5 without Mane. \n Indeed, since Mane's arrival on Merseyside, Liverpool have scored 2.2 goals per Premier League match with him in their line-up and 1.5 goals without him. \n See:  The Scout's GW8 Ones to watch \n",
