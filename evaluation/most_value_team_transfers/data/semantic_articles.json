(@CPFC)  July 30, 2022 \n \n Zaha was his side’s standout performer at Selhurst Park in 2021/22, their first season under Patrick Vieira. \n He totalled 82 points in those fixtures, averaging an impressive 5.4 points per start. \n Notably, that included a goal and an eight-point return in a  3-0 win over the Gunners  in Gameweek 31. \n The underlying numbers further highlight Zaha’s all-round importance to Palace in the previous campaign. \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the £100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n At home, his totals of 38 shots, 19 shots on target and 26 chances created were all more than any team-mate. \n Defensive injuries \n Zaha's prospects could be further boosted by Arsenal’s injury concerns in defence. \n The Gunners have been without their first-choice right-back  Takehiro Tomiyasu  (£4.5m) recently, with centre-back  Ben White  (£4.5m) deputising. \n Playing on the left of Palace’s front three, Zaha’s pace and trickery will be vital in helping the hosts exploit that weakness. \n Zaha has the form to immediately reward managers and enjoy a successful start to 2022/23 Fantasy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  Bruno Guimaraes (NEW) Part 3:  Andrew Robertson (LIV) Part 4:  Leon Bailey (AVL) Part 5:  Son Heung-min (TOT) \n Don't forget the Gameweek 1 deadline is 18:30 BST on Friday 5 August. \n",

        "text": "\n Saturday 26 March is  Non-League Day , with fans encouraged to attend a non-league match, and we are highlighting non-league clubs who have been supported by the Premier League. \n Blyth Spartans \n Released by his beloved  Newcastle United  when he was 11,  Dan Burn  started to make his way in the game in non-league, playing for his local club Blyth Spartans. \n Eighteen years later, Burn is back at Newcastle as a first-team player, but he has not forgotten his roots.  \n To mark Non-League Day, Burn returned to his old stomping ground to see how Blyth Spartans and their Croft Park home have been transformed with support from the Premier League. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n \"I was looking through the Premier League funding figures and it's good to see the grants the club have been receiving,\" Burn says. \"It's nice to see where the money is going to. Spartans are a big part of the community here and have been around a long time.\" \n Over the last 20 years, Blyth Spartans, who play in National League North, the sixth tier of the English football pyramid, have received various grants to help improve terracing, stands, seating, pitch barriers as well as for the construction of a viewing area for disabled supporters. \n Blyth were also one of more than 1,000 National League, Women's Football and Welsh Premier League clubs who claimed Premier League funding via the  Matchday Support Fund  to prepare for the resumption of football after the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \"W e think we've got a nice tiny ground for this s tandard of football,\" says the club's chairman Tony Platten. \" And it's ready to go up to the National League.\" \n This has been part of the League's longstanding support of the football pyramid which will continue with the Premier League Stadium Fund. \n The fund will involve grants totalling £16million being made available to clubs in the National League system and women's football pyramid for them to invest in projects to develop many aspects of their grounds. \n How to support Non-League Day \n You can show support for the hundreds of semi-professional and amateur clubs around England by going to a non-league match on the weekend of 26-27 March. \n To find your nearest non-league match, visit  nonleagueday.co.uk/map . \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at the impact of players who have joined new clubs in the 2022 summer transfer window.  \n Gianluca Scamacca (WHU) \n Scamacca will offer  West Ham United  much-needed depth up front for the 2022/23 season and beyond. \n \n \n \n \n \n WHU \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 2 \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n The 6ft 4in striker netted 16 goals for Sassuolo in Serie A last term, enjoying the best season of his career so far. \n Scamacca's style of play remains a touch unpolished, but he is strong in the air, hardworking and capable of producing a variety of quality right-footed finishes. \n While  Michail Antonio  has largely been excellent for West Ham, the 32-year-old tired during the second half of 2021/22, possibly due to the absence of a natural target-man alternative. \n The presence of Scamacca will allow  David Moyes  to rest and rotate his forward line without weakening the team. \n Scamacca's goal variety 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Style \n Range \n \n \n \n \n Right foot \n 13 \n 0-6 yards \n 5 \n \n \n Header \n 3 \n 7-18 yards \n 8 \n \n \n Left foot \n 0 \n 18+ yards \n 3 \n \n \n \n Three of Scamacca’s goals last season arrived courtesy of memorable long-distance strikes. \n He found the back of the net with one direct free-kick from outside the box, and twice with goals from open play, including a 25-yard scorcher into the top corner against AC Milan. \n The 23-year-old hits the ball cleanly with his right foot, and also scored with three terrific volleyed efforts in the previous campaign. \n \n \n Make an espresso, put your feet up and roll back the years! ☕️🇮🇹 🗣 In a very special edition of Gazzetta Football Italia, Gianluca Scamacca speaks with  @acjimbo  for the first time as a West Ham United player!  pic.twitter.com/ts7fFDJedO \n— West Ham United (@WestHam)  July 27, 2022 \n \n Scamacca evades his markers with smart movement inside the area too, especially when crosses are sent in. \n Using his height, the Italy international attacks aerial balls with real purpose and West Ham’s strength at set-pieces can only be enhanced. \n Link-up play \n Another of Scamacca's attributes is an ability to hold the ball up and bring others into play. \n His pass accuracy averaged 74.6 per cent last season, a respectable figure for a centre-forward who usually leads the line on his own. \n Scamacca's tendency is to keep things simple when part of the build-up. \n If West Ham want to hit a few extra longer passes from defence to attack, his presence will certainly provide encouragement. \n Scamacca v WHU aerial comparison \n \n \n \n Player \n Duels won \n \n \n \n \n Scamacca \n 55.7% \n \n \n Antonio \n 40.9% \n \n \n Yarmolenko \n 38.5% \n \n \n Bowen \n 36.9% \n \n \n \n He won almost 56 per cent of his aerial duels last season, way ahead of the averages recorded by the Hammers' forwards. \n So, when long balls are played forward for Scamacca, look out for  Jarrod Bowen  sprinting beyond the last defender to his flick-ons.   \n Scamacca has all the attributes a Premier League striker needs and will hope to hit the ground running for West Ham. \n See:   Talking Tactics: New signings for 2022/23 \n   \n",

        "text": "\n Every  Fantasy Premier League  manager seems to be going for Gabriel Jesus (£8.0m) but are they overlooking another brilliant  Arsenal  pick to start 2022/23 with? \n Jesus is the most-owned player in the game, with 68.8% ownership, but Adrian Clarke believes the Brazilian should be paired with someone he believes can be this season's Kevin De Bruyne (£12.0m). \n \"Last season Jarrod Bowen [£8.5m] was the differential that emerged,\" he says on the latest episode of  The FPL Pod . \"The one player that's making great strides every time I see him is Martin Odegaard, he's available at £6.5m, owned by around 11% of managers.  \n \"He's capable of scoring eight to 10 goals and making 10 to 12 assists. With Jesus's movement he can be Arsenal's KDB.\" \n \n Fantasy expert Sam Bonfield, meanwhile, thinks Odegaard could be outshone by another £6.5m midfielder. \n \"Marcus Rashford [£6.5m] is going to have a phenomenal season,\" she replies.  \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the £100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n Running order: - Intros (00m 50s) - Goalkeeper picks (03m 10s) - Defender picks (11m 11s) - Midfielder picks (24m 41s) - Forward picks (32m 59s) \n Join The FPL Pod mini-league at  https://preml.ge/FPLPodMini \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout looks at the transfer trends of  Fantasy Premier League  managers and picks out the best differentials ahead of the start of the 2022/23 season. \n Forwards \n Arsenal ’s  Gabriel Jesus  (£8.0m) and  Manchester City  striker  Erling Haaland  (£11.5m) have both been a top priority when building opening squads. \n The duo are the most-owned players in the game, found in 65 per cent and 57 per cent of teams respectively. \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the £100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n Tottenham Hotspur 's  Harry Kane  (£11.5m) has also proven popular, backed by 23 per cent, while 25 per cent of managers have picked  Leeds United  front man  Sam Greenwood  (£4.5m) to sit on their bench.  \n Those four are the only forwards with an ownership in excess of 20 per cent, handing managers some ready-made differentials for the first few Gameweeks. \n Jamie Vardy (LEI) £9.5m \n Leicester City 's talisman averaged 5.3 points per match last term, joint-top with  Cristiano Ronaldo  (£10.5m) among forwards in Fantasy. \n Despite being limited to just 20 starts due to injury, Vardy still showed his potential for huge hauls by recording seven double-digit returns. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n He is owned by a mere five per cent of managers ahead of a favourable short-term schedule, with Brendan Rodgers’ side  hosting Brentford  and  Southampton  in the first three Gameweeks. \n Callum Wilson (NEW) £7.5m \n Newcastle United ’s forward was also sidelined for large parts of last season, managing just 16 starts. \n Yet Wilson still proved a reliable source of returns when selected, finding the net on eight occasions.  \n Indeed, his average of 173.8 minutes per goal ranked third among forwards with more than three goals in 2021/22. \n Selected by a mere three per cent of managers, Wilson has the schedule to start the campaign in prolific form. \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), four of the Magpies’ first six matches score only two.  \n Anthony Martial (MUN) £7.0m \n The Frenchman has been among  Manchester United ’s most impressive performers under new manager Erik ten Hag this summer. \n Handed the lone striker role in the ongoing absence of Ronaldo, Martial has scored in three of his four appearances so far. \n Costing only £7.0m, the forward could deliver major value from the very start of the season.  \n Three of the Red Devils’ opening four matches score two in the FDR.  \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Sa among overlooked goalkeepers Part 2:  Versatile Zinchenko can thrive at Arsenal Part 3:  Grealish can be an early bargain \n",

But overall, Eriksen's numbers from last term are still comparable to his rival for a starting spot. \n In 2021/22, the Dane actually delivered a direct goal contribution (goal or assist) at a slightly faster rate than Fernandes. \n \n \n Our new recruit has revealed how Erik influenced his decision to join United 👀✍️ 🗣  @ChrisEriksen8 #MUFC \n— Manchester United (@ManUtd)  July 27, 2022 \n \n Eriksen has stated that Ten Hag's style of football was a big lure for him. \n The Dutchman is renowned for an attacking philosophy that centres around clever patterns of play and technically outstanding individuals. \n A proven Premier League performer, Eriksen has the qualities needed to thrive for United. \n See:   Talking Tactics: New signings for 2022/23 \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at the impact of players who have joined new clubs in the 2022 summer transfer window.  \n Joao Palhinha (FUL) \n Marco Silva’s  Fulham  will need to improve defensively if they are to be competitive upon their Premier League return in 2022/23. \n \n \n \n \n \n FUL \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 2 \n \n LIV \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n On that front, the recruitment of Palhinha certainly looks to be a step in the right direction. \n Performing superbly as a defensive midfielder for Sporting Lisbon across the last two campaigns, Palhinha has attributes that should provide quality protection for Fulham’s defence. \n During their Championship title-winning campaign, Fulham did not need to rely on a solid central midfielder who specialises in breaking up play. \n As they step up a level though,  Silva  will be acutely aware of the value this type of player will offer, and this is where Palhinha has strong pedigree. \n Palhinha's pre-season goal v Estoril \n \n \n More to come. 💪 #FFC   https://t.co/0i6NQO4E1z   pic.twitter.com/XqOrxwpnrr \n— Fulham Football Club (@FulhamFC)  July 26, 2022 \n \n The 27-year-old shone in last season’s UEFA Champions League (UCL), winning 2.2 tackles per 90 minutes, the fifth-highest number. \n Displaying aggression, discipline, and defensive resolve aplenty, he also won an average of 9.1 duels per 90. \n This was a tally bettered by just three midfielders in the competition, one of whom was England international Jude Bellingham. \n Top tacklers UCL 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Tackles won/90 \n Player \n Duels won/90 \n \n \n \n \n Vidal \n 2.9 \n Ngamaleu \n 10.8 \n \n \n Kondogbia \n 2.5 \n Bellingham \n 10.4 \n \n \n Lo Celso \n 2.4 \n Bennacer \n 9.8 \n \n \n Josef \n 2.2 \n Palhinha \n 9.1 \n \n \n Palhinha \n 2.2 \n Vidal \n 8.4 \n \n \n \n *Min four starts \n The way Fulham regain possession to spring transitional attacks is going to be crucial to their prospects of success. \n Palhinha’s presence in the heart of midfield instantly improves them in this department. \n According to  Fbref , he featured in the top one per cent across Europe’s competitions last season for the most pressures by midfielders per 90, averaging a very impressive 32.4 per match. \n Aggressive approach \n Palhinha’s combative style means he gets embroiled in plenty of physical tussles. \n He averaged two fouls per match in Liga Portugal last season and in the UEFA Champions League – a number that rose to 3.9 fouls conceded per 90 minutes. \n This ranked him third for midfielders who made at least four starts. \n Free-kick winner \n On the flip side, Fulham will also win a lot of free-kicks because of Palhinha’s quality in tight areas. \n The Portugal international has quick feet, is composed when in possession and is not afraid to try and beat an opponent; he draws fouls on a frequent basis. \n In fact, just six UEFA Champions League midfielders earned more free-kicks per 90 than Palhinha, who was felled 2.9 times per match. \n Fulham must profit from the many dead-ball situations he could earn them this season. \n Most-fouled UCL midfielders 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Fouled/90 \n \n \n \n \n Lucas Ocampos \n 3.5 \n \n \n Jack Grealish \n 3.3 \n \n \n Mohamed Camara \n 3.2 \n \n \n Brahim Diaz \n 3.1 \n \n \n Jude Bellingham \n 3.1 \n \n \n Vitaliy Buyalskiy \n 2.9 \n \n \n Joao Palhinha \n 2.9 \n \n \n \n *Min four starts \n Palhinha makes up for a slight lack of pace with a very sound tactical game. \n Ball-winning qualities are his main strength, but he also has an eye for a pass, averaging 87.8 per cent accuracy with his passing in the league last term. \n If Palhinha adapts quickly to life in the Premier League, Fulham's prospects will receive a significant boost. \n See:   Talking Tactics: New signings for 2022/23 \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout looks at the transfer trends of  Fantasy Premier League  managers and picks out the best differentials ahead of the start of the 2022/23 season. \n Midfielders \n Mohamed Salah  (£13.0m) is the go-to midfielder in Fantasy, with his 56.4 per cent ownership more than double any other player in his position. \n There is far more variety elsewhere in managers’ midfields, with only three others selected by over 20 per cent of managers. \n Salah’s  Liverpool  team-mate  Luis Diaz  (£8.0m) has emerged as the most popular mid-priced pick, while  Tottenham Hotspur ’s  Son Heung-min  (£12.0m) is another favourite in the premium bracket. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n And  Fulham ’s  Andreas Pereira  (£4.5m) is the preferred budget option following his summer move from  Manchester United .  \n As a result, there are plenty of overlooked players who could prove to be standout differentials in the early stages of the new campaign.  \n Jack Grealish (MCI) £7.0m \n The  Manchester City  winger has been quick to find his form, supplying the assist for Erling Haaland’s (£11.5m) debut winner against Bayern Munich last week. \n Although he managed just three goals and three assists in his debut campaign for Man City last season, Grealish’s underlying numbers are encouraging.  \n Indeed, his 41 shots in the box and 53 chances created both placed among their top five players.  \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the £100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n At a cost of £7.0m, he can be found in a mere five per cent of squads ahead of a favourable early schedule. \n The champions are the only side who avoid all of last season’s top six in the first six Gameweeks.  \n James Maddison (LEI) £8.0m  \n Leicester City ’s playmaker enjoyed his best-ever Fantasy campaign last term, amassing 181 points thanks to 12 goals and 11 assists. \n Maddison’s all-round influence on the Foxes’ attack is further highlighted by his statistics. \n His totals of 72 shots, 33 shots on target and 48 chances created were all more than any team-mate. \n The 25-year-old is owned by just over five per cent of managers ahead of  home meetings with Brentford  and  Southampton  in the first three Gameweeks. \n Yet Maddison thrived in the corresponding fixtures in 2021/22, claiming double-figure hauls on each occasion.  \n Daniel Podence (WOL) £5.5m \n A kind early run of opponents lifts the value of  Wolverhampton Wanderers ’ key players in Fantasy. \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), four of their first six matches score just two. \n Pedro Neto  (£5.5m) has emerged as a popular target for opening squads, boasting an ownership of 19 per cent. \n Yet not only is Podence the same price, he has matched Neto’s output of three goals and an assist over the summer. \n Sitting in under one per cent of squads, Podence is an enticing option in the sub-£6.0m bracket. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Sa among overlooked goalkeepers Part 2:  Versatile Zinchenko can thrive at Arsenal Part 4:  Back Vardy in kind home fixtures \n",

        "text": "\n In 2022/23,  Fantasy Premier League  managers will have to pick a select number of premiums from a big-hitting group including  Mohamed Salah  (£13.0m),  Son Heung-min ,  Kevin De Bruyne  (both £12.0m),  Harry Kane  and  Erling Haaland  (both £11.5m). \n So will it be shrewd strategy to jump between them throughout the season? Two Fantasy experts have different tactics. \n Sam Bonfield , of FPL Family, says: “I always find that at the end of the season the premium players are going to be the ones who score the most points. If you move around between them there’s a risk that you miss the points hauls. \n “I like to stay loyal and know that come the end of the season they’re probably all going to have scored roughly the same number of points.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Sam’s fellow expert  Pranil Sheth  is going for the opposing strategy, stating: “There’s no fixed premium in my team this season. Based on performance, as well as fixtures, premiums will keep going in and out of my team. \n “The top-six teams have all strengthened this season and I feel like the number of options you have among the premium picks is a lot.” \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the £100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  FPL experts' top tips for picking your squad Part 2:  FPL experts' must-have players for 2022/23 Part 4:  How the World Cup affects Wildcard strategy Part 5:  FPL experts' best budget enablers \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at the impact of players who have joined new clubs in the 2022 summer transfer window.  \n Kalidou Koulibaly (CHE) \n When  Antonio Rudiger  moved to Real Madrid this summer it put  Chelsea  in the market for a left-sided central defender with experience, physical strength, and quality in possession. \n \n \n \n \n \n EVE \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 1 \n \n CHE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n The signing of Koulibaly from Napoli certainly ticks all those boxes. \n One of Serie A's most reliable centre-backs across the last eight seasons, the 31-year-old should have no issues filling the hole vacated by Chelsea's most impressive defender last term. \n Koulibaly’s 1.93-metre frame makes him formidable in duels with opposing forwards. \n Koulibaly's first training session \n \n \n Raheem and Kalidou down to work at Cobham! 👊  pic.twitter.com/W7VpzdZYXI \n— Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC)  July 26, 2022 \n \n Powerful in the air and boasting strong recovery pace, he is rarely easy to bypass. \n Across the last five campaigns in Italy, Koulibaly has featured inside the top 10 with the percentage of successful pressures. \n Koulibaly successful pressures in Serie A \n \n \n \n Season \n Successful pressures \n League rank \n \n \n \n \n 2018/19 \n 34.8% \n 5th \n \n \n 2017/18 \n 37.1% \n 7th \n \n \n 2019/20 \n 35.9% \n 4th \n \n \n 2020/21 \n 40.6% \n 2nd \n \n \n 2021/22 \n 41.8% \n 2nd \n \n \n \n During his final two seasons with Napoli, Koulibaly was at his best when applying pressure in duels. \n Winning the ball back 41.8 per cent of the time within five seconds, the Senegal international was ranked second in Serie A. \n Comfortable on the ball \n Koulibaly’s qualities are not limited to defending or physicality, he is also accomplished on the ball and that will fit in with  Thomas Tuchel 's style of play. \n He is accustomed to performing as a left-sided central defender in a back four, but should have no problems adapting to a three-man formation. \n Naturally right-footed, he is a terrific and accurate passer with both feet, displaying variety in the type of deliveries too. \n Koulibaly's passing range 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Pass type \n Total \n Success \n \n \n \n \n Short \n 586 \n 93.3% \n \n \n Medium \n 695 \n 92.5% \n \n \n Long \n 315 \n 67.9% \n \n \n \n Travelling smoothly with the ball is another trait that befits a side who want to build possession from the back three. \n Last season,  Cesar Azpilicueta ,  Trevoh Chalobah ,  Reece James  and Rudiger all caught the eye with positive surges into the opposition half for Chelsea from a wide centre-back position. \n Koulibaly needs no encouragement to power forward with the ball. \n Serie A successful dribbles 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Successful dribbles \n Total dribbles \n \n \n \n \n Jerdy Schouten \n 89.7% \n 29 \n \n \n Kalidou Koulibaly \n 86.4% \n 22 \n \n \n Ismael Bennacer \n 84.8% \n 46 \n \n \n Gaetano Castrovilli \n 81% \n 21 \n \n \n Manuel Locatelli \n 80% \n 20 \n \n \n \n While he is selective around the right moments to stride forward, Koulibaly is difficult to stop whenever he does. \n His confidence in this aspect of play should quickly impress Chelsea fans. \n Only Jedry Schouten of Bologna could better his 86.4 per cent success rate for dribbles in Serie A last term, so you can expect Tuchel to encourage his new charge to repeat this tactic. \n At 31, Koulibably has vast experience and defensive nous at the highest level. \n He may need a short period of time to adapt to the Premier League, but Koulibaly has all the qualities required to shine for Chelsea. \n Tomorrow:  Palhinha can reinforce Fulham midfield \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  How Haaland will take Premier League by storm Part 2:  How Nunez can fill Mane void Part 3:  Perisic a perfect fit for Conte's Spurs Part 4:  Jesus can propel Arsenal to success Part 5:  Awoniyi is ideal to lead Forest's line Part 6:  Richarlison's style can push Spurs on Part 7:  Botman has strength to lift Newcastle Part 8:  Sterling to give Chelsea a clinical edge Part 9:  Bella-Kotchap can shore up Saints' high line Part 10:  Aguerd can bring balance to West Ham Part 11:  Adams an ideal fit to replace Phillips \n",

Regardless of results, they are here, they have achieved something by becoming brilliant young people. They are going places. \n \"I love the initiatives the Premier League give to young people. To come to venues like this, it's absolutely life-changing.\" \n Community impact \n PL Kicks  is the Premier League's longest-running community programme, which celebrated its 15th anniversary earlier this year. \n It is delivered across England and Wales by 90 Premier League, EFL and National League clubs and through football, workshops and mentoring, provides opportunities to young people who may face barriers in their everyday lives. \n To date, more than 440,000 young people have participated in PL Kicks. \n \"I've changed a lot,\" said one PL Kicks Cup participant, who was representing Swindon Town. \"Mostly, I stayed at home and did nothing. \n \"Coming to PL Kicks, I started to play loads of football and now I tell everyone to come along.\" \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  'Premier League Kicks is bringing people together' Part 2:  How PL Kicks Cup gives young people the chance to shine Part 3:  PL Kicks inspiring girls to play the game they love Part 5:  'PL Kicks shows that anyone can play football' \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout looks at the transfer trends of  Fantasy Premier League  managers and picks out the best differentials ahead of the start of the 2022/23 season. \n Defenders \n Trent Alexander-Arnold  (£7.5m),  Joao Cancelo  (£7.0m) and  Reece James  (£6.0m) have dominated the plans of Fantasy managers, with all three found in over 40 per cent of squads. \n Liverpool 's Alexander-Arnold and  Manchester City 's Cancelo were the top-scoring defenders in Fantasy last season, amassing 208 and 201 points respectively. \n James, meanwhile, averaged 6.3 points per start for  Chelsea , just behind the 6.5 points per start of Alexander-Arnold. \n Their popularity leaves a host of strong options at the back for managers to consider. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Oleksandr Zinchenko (ARS) £5.0m \n The Ukrainian looks set to secure a regular role for  Arsenal  after arriving from Man City. \n Zinchenko was limited to only 10 starts last season, yet still averaged 5.1 points per match in those outings, thanks to four assists and five clean sheets. \n His versatility could be crucial for the Gunners, offering an option at both left-back and central midfield. \n He is owned by just over eight per cent of squads ahead of a very favourable run of early opponents. \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), six of Arsenal's first eight matches score only two. \n Andrew Robertson (LIV) £7.0m \n Liverpool's left-back can be found in 10 per cent of squads, compared with the 54 per cent of his team-mate Alexander-Arnold. \n Robertson enjoyed an outstanding second half of the previous campaign, blanking in just one of his final 15 starts. \n The Scot produced a team-high 117 points from Gameweek 20 onwards, compared with the 85 points of Alexander-Arnold. \n Combined with their kind opening schedule, doubling up on the Reds pair could prove a strong tactic early on. \n Jurgen Klopp's side face only one of last season's top six in their first seven matches.  \n Lucas Digne (AVL) £5.0m \n The  Aston Villa  left-back has been largely overlooked due to the popularity of his fellow defender  Matty Cash  (£5.0m). \n Whereas Cash is found in 20 per cent of squads, Digne is backed by just over three per cent. \n The Frenchman was a standout creator after Steven Gerrard arrived as head coach in Gameweek 12 last season. \n His 34 key passes placed second for Villa from that point on and ranked third among defenders, bettered only by Liverpool pair Alexander-Arnold and Robertson.  \n Each of Villa's first three matches score only two in the FDR, lifting Digne's appeal as a short-term pick. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Sa among overlooked goalkeepers Part 3:  Grealish can be an early bargain Part 4:  Back Vardy in kind home fixtures \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout looks at the transfer trends of  Fantasy Premier League  managers and picks out the best differentials ahead of the start of the 2022/23 season. \n Goalkeepers \n The goalkeepers from last season's top-three sides are the most popular picks in Fantasy so far. \n Chelsea 's  Edouard Mendy  (£5.0m) is the most-selected player in his position, found in over 23 per cent of squads. \n Meanwhile,  Liverpool 's  Alisson  and  Manchester City 's  Ederson  (both £5.5m) have 19 and 15 per cent backing respectively, despite their premium prices. \n But there are a number of appealing alternatives to consider between the posts, particularly for managers looking to play an early Wildcard. \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the £100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n Jose Sa (WOL) £5.0m \n Wolverhampton Wanderers ' No 1 was a major success in his first season in Fantasy last term. \n Sa produced 146 points to finish fourth among 'keepers, only nine points behind the 155 of Ederson. \n The Portuguese combined 11 clean sheets with 30 save points and 11 bonus points, highlighting his many routes to returns. \n Owned by only 4.5 per cent of managers, Sa has the schedule to bring in more big scores from the start of 2022/23. \n Wolves face only one of last season's top six teams in their opening six fixtures. \n Hugo Lloris (TOT) £5.5m \n Tottenham Hotspur 's Frenchman finished second in his position last term, recording his career-high haul of 158 points. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Lloris's output was lifted by the arrival of Antonio Conte as Spurs' head coach in 2021/22. \n The north London side claimed 13 clean sheets after the Italian was appointed in Gameweek 11, the third-most in the league. \n Lloris has an ownership of only 4.7 per cent ahead of Spurs' kind opening schedule. \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), four of their first six matches score only two. \n Illan Meslier (LEE) £4.5m \n The  Leeds United  goalkeeper has dropped £0.5m in cost from the start of last season after a disappointing 2021/22 campaign. \n Meslier had finished as the second top-scoring 'keeper in 2020/21 on 154 points but he managed only 106 points last term. \n Nonetheless, despite keeping a mere five clean sheets, his 34 save points were more than any other rival. \n If Leeds can profit from their early schedule in their first full season under Jesse Marsch, Meslier can be a major source of value. \n Eight of Leeds' opening 10 matches score only two in the FDR. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  Versatile Zinchenko can thrive at Arsenal Part 3:  Grealish can be an early bargain Part 4:  Back Vardy in kind home fixtures \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout is helping  Fantasy Premier League  managers to build their 15-man squads ahead of Gameweek 1 with some ready-made solutions.  \n Spreading funds evenly \n Spreading funds evenly across the team and targeting the £8.0m midfield price point looks a wise tactic, with  Dejan Kulusevski ,  Luis Diaz ,  James Maddison  and  Bukayo Saka  among the most secure starters at this cost.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Managers can afford two big-hitters, with  Mohamed Salah  (£13.0m) and  Erling Haaland  (£11.5m) the most popular premium-priced players in Fantasy, found in 56 and 58 per cent of squads respectively. \n By picking this duo, managers would have a captain who faces a promoted side in four of the first five Gameweeks. \n At the opposite end of the price scale, low-budget starters such as  Neco Williams  (£4.0m) and  Andreas Pereira  (£4.5m) will strengthen managers’ benches following their respective moves to  Nottingham Forest  and  Fulham . \n Goalkeepers \n Wolverhampton Wanderers ’  Jose Sa  (£5.0m) was the fourth top-scoring ‘keeper last season, amassing 146 points. \n Pairing the Portuguese with his understudy  Matija Sarkic  (£4.0m) costs a combined £9.0m, allowing managers to profit from Wolves’ kind early schedule. \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), four of their first six matches score only two. \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the £100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n Defenders \n Liverpool  right-back  Trent Alexander-Arnold  (£7.5m) and  Manchester City ’s  Joao Cancelo  (£7.0m) were the top-scoring defenders in 2021/22 thanks to their multiple routes to returns. \n Both clubs also have appealing runs of opponents from the start of the campaign, facing only one of last season’s top six teams in their first seven outings.  \n Chelsea ’s  Ben Chilwell  (£6.0m) amassed 55 points in his six appearances last term, combining three goals and an assist with four clean sheets. \n Oleksandr Zinchenko  (£5.0m) looks set to become a key figure for  Arsenal  following his switch from Man City, with the versatile Ukrainian offering an option at left-back or in midfield.  \n Meanwhile, at a cost of £4.0m Forest wing-back  Williams  is among the cheapest starters across all positions in Fantasy. \n Midfielders \n Salah  is joined by  Tottenham Hotspur ’s  Kulusevski , who was a huge success after arriving midway through last season.  \n The Swede averaged 6.3 points per start in 2021/22, totalling 99 points thanks to five goals and nine assists. \n Jack Grealish  (£7.0m) has been a standout player in Man City’s summer friendlies, supplying the assist for Haaland’s debut goal against Bayern Munich. \n \n \n ➡️  @KevinDeBruyne   ➡️  @JackGrealish   ⚽️  @ErlingHaaland  ⚽️ #ManCity  |  @Sure   pic.twitter.com/eaoGPnZsut \n— Manchester City (@ManCity)  July 24, 2022 \n \n Arsenal’s  Gabriel Martinelli  (£6.0m), meanwhile, has one goal and three assists over the summer. His chances of starting the season look encouraging as his rival  Emile Smith Rowe  (also £6.0m) is yet to feature due to injury. \n Fulham’s  Pereira  has supplied an assist in each of his two appearances and has been handed a share of set-pieces.  \n Forwards \n Manchester United ’s  Anthony Martial  (£7.0m) partners  Haaland  in a front two. \n The Frenchman has thrived under new manager Erik ten Hag, scoring three goals over the summer. \n \n \n Right place, right time. @AnthonyMartial  👌 #MUFC  ||  #MUTOUR22   pic.twitter.com/3g0RsF7OBW \n— Manchester United (@ManUtd)  July 15, 2022 \n \n Martial looks likely to start the campaign as his side’s lone striker, with  Cristiano Ronaldo  (£10.5m) failing to play any minutes so far. \n Three of the Red Devils’ first four matches score two in the FDR, lifting Martial’s appeal as a short-term pick at least. \n Aston Villa’ s  Cameron Archer  (£4.5m) could be a handy cut-price forward for managers’ benches, having scored twice over their friendlies. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Own Salah, De Bruyne and Kane Part 2:  Premium defence \n",

        "text": "\n Ahead of the 2022/23 season starting on 5 August, here are things you will see for the first time. \n Goalkeepers' position on penalties \n The position of a goalkeeper before and when any penalty kick is taken has been amended for this season. \n The  IFAB Laws of the Game  now states the following: \n \"Law 14: The Penalty Kick \"When the ball is kicked , the defending goalkeeper must have at least part of one foot touching, or in line with,  or behind , the goalline.\" \n Previously the goalkeeper was required to have part of at least one foot on/above the goalline at the moment when a penalty, or kick from the penalty mark, was taken. \n Consequently, if the goalkeeper had one foot in front of the goalline and one behind it, this was technically an offence even though no unfair advantage was gained. The wording of Law 14 has been amended to avoid such a position being penalised. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Five substitutes Part 2:  Nike Flight ball Part 3:  New match officials Part 4:  Premier League 2 changes age limit Part 6:  New match postponement guidance Part 7:  Offsides Part 8:  Multiball system \n",

        "text": "\n Nine of the world’s leading  Fantasy Premier League  managers have combined to pick what they believe is the best team for the start of 2022/23 FPL. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Their four-man defence includes  Tottenham Hotspur ’s 33-year-old summer signing Ivan Perisic (£5.5m), who is expected to play as a left wing-back. \n Fantasy expert  Gianni Buttice  explains: “We know Antonio Conte loves him. He had him at Inter and what we saw was Perisic getting forward and forward and forward. \n “He loves a goal, he has real assist threat and he’s comfortable crossing on both feet. With that, you’re expecting a lot of Harry Kane [£11.5m] back-stick headers. He’s also got the durability and energy of a 27 or 28-year-old. This guy can get up and down all day long.” \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the £100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n Mason Mount (£8.0m) has also been selected. \n Gianni’s fellow expert  Utkarsh Dalmia , a  Chelsea  fan, says: “Mount was Chelsea’s top scorer last season and he also created 11 assists. \n “In terms of game-time he’s one of the most secure in [Thomas] Tuchel’s line-up and he should improve on his tallies from last year.” \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Saint-Maximin can star early on Part 2:  Havertz will be Chelsea's main man Part 3:  Bank on De Bruyne for bonus Part 4:  Pick Grealish alongside Haaland \n",

There's something really beautiful about that.\" \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  'Premier League Kicks is bringing people together' Part 3:  PL Kicks inspiring girls to play the game they love Part 4:  'PL Kicks Cup is life-changing for young people' Part 5:  'PL Kicks shows that anyone can play football' \n",

Kane has scored five and assisted one, while Son has scored two and assisted four. \n Kane's first goal v Rangers \n \n \n Harry Kane doing Harry Kane things 🔥  pic.twitter.com/vuHFH2JsTp \n— Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial)  July 23, 2022 \n \n Their fellow big-hitter  Erling   Haaland  (£11.5m) made an instant impact on his debut for  Manchester City , scoring the decisive goal in a 1-0 victory over Bayern Munich. \n Haaland is the second most-popular player in Fantasy, owned by over 58 per cent of managers despite playing only 45 minutes over Man City’s two friendlies. \n Those backers will get another chance to assess the forward's fitness when Pep Guardiola's side face  Liverpool  in the Community Shield on Saturday, their final pre-season fixture. \n Haaland scores v Bayern Munich \n \n \n ➡️  @KevinDeBruyne   ➡️  @JackGrealish   ⚽️  @ErlingHaaland  ⚽️ #ManCity  |  @Sure   pic.twitter.com/eaoGPnZsut \n— Manchester City (@ManCity)  July 24, 2022 \n \n Gabriel Jesus  (£8.0m), meanwhile, continues to show why he is the most-selected player in the game. \n Arsenal ’s Brazilian can be found in 62.8 per cent of squads after scoring the opener in their 4-0 win over  Chelsea . \n He has four goals and an assist over his four summer appearances since joining the Gunners.  \n Jesus' goal v Chelsea \n \n \n Clinical from Gabby 🔥 📍 Camping World Stadium  pic.twitter.com/Jq0Cq6btfG \n— Arsenal (@Arsenal)  July 24, 2022 \n \n Fulham ’s  Aleksandar Mitrovic  (£6.5m) is another in-form forward. \n The Serb was involved in all of his side's goals in a 3-1 win over Estoril, scoring twice and supplying an assist.  \n His team-mate  Andreas Pereira  (£4.5m) also impressed, supplying an assist for the second successive match since joining from  Manchester United . \n Indeed, the Brazilian is the most-owned midfielder in the sub-£8.0 bracket, selected in 23.7 per cent of squads. \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the £100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n Pereira is among a number of cut-price midfielders who can offer early value in Fantasy. \n Wolverhampton Wanderers  wingers  Pedro Neto  and  Daniel Podence  (both £5.5m) have each produced three goals and an assist in pre-season. \n Leon Bailey  (£5.0m) strengthened his claim for a starting role for  Aston Villa  by starring in their draw with Man Utd. \n The Jamaican emerged from the bench to produce a goal and an assist, doubling his attacking output for the summer. \n Midfield differentials \n Finally, Man Utd winger  Jadon Sancho  (£7.5m) and  Crystal Palace  talisman  Wilfried Zaha  (£7.0m) boast strong form in the mid-price midfield bracket.  \n Sancho continues to thrive under new manager Erik ten Hag, scoring his third goal of pre-season against Villa. \n Zaha produced two goals and an assist in Palace's 3-0 win at Queens Park Rangers.

        "text": "\n The FA, Premier League and EFL are together introducing new measures and stronger sanctions across the game to tackle the increased anti-social and criminal behaviours recently seen within football grounds and underline the importance of a safe matchday environment.  \n The new set of actions, which will be implemented across all English football leagues from the start of Season 2022/23 and backed by the Football Supporters’ Association, will target activity such as entering the pitch without permission, carrying or using smoke bombs or pyrotechnics and throwing objects - as well as drug use and discriminatory behaviour.   \n These acts are dangerous, illegal and have severe consequences. They have no place in football, or anywhere. \n \n \n ❌ Entering the pitch  ❌ Use of flares & smoke bombs  ❌ Throwing objects ❌ Discriminatory behaviour ❌ Taking drugs Football is coming together to bring in strong measures to tackle antisocial and criminal behaviour:  https://t.co/FbftQnEt8x #LoveFootball   #ProtectTheGame   pic.twitter.com/a4tzmvxT7i \n— Premier League (@premierleague)  July 25, 2022 \n \n From the start of Season 2022/23, all identified offenders will be reported by clubs to the police and prosecution could result in a permanent criminal record, which may affect their employment and education, and could result in a prison sentence. The FA will also be enforcing a tougher charging and sanctioning policy for clubs, which will reinforce these measures .    \n Furthermore, anyone who enters the pitch and those identified carrying or using pyrotechnics or smoke bombs will now receive an automatic club ban. These bans could also be extended to accompanying parents or guardians of children who take part in these activities.   \n The safety of everyone attending a matchday is the game’s collective priority. We know the behaviours carried out by some fans last season do not represent the majority of supporters and they risk ruining the fantastic experience of a football match for everyone. Therefore, we are working with clubs to highlight the important role that fans, clubs, players and coaches all have to play in helping to create a safe environment.     \n Our strong and collective approach reflects how seriously we all view this issue and the severity of the risks. Nobody should be intimidated or assaulted in their workplace. The pitch must remain safe for players, managers and match officials, just as the stands should be for supporters.    \n \n \n \"If we don’t take collective and sustained action, it may only be a matter of time before someone is seriously injured, or worse\" \n \n Richard Masters, Premier League CEO \n \n \n \n To further support this action, The FA, Premier League and EFL are working with police forces, the UK Football Policing Unit (UKFPU), and the Crown Prosecution Service to establish a new principle for cases relating to pyrotechnics and smoke bombs, as well as entering the pitch without permission. This will mean cooperating to achieve a prosecution in these cases will become the default response of the football authorities and criminal justice system, sending a clear and unambiguous message to all who break the law.       \n Other measures to be implemented include working with clubs to enhance search regimes and increased use of sniffer dogs at grounds. We will also be working in partnership with our clubs, players and managers, the Government, broadcasters, the police and social media platforms in seeking to discourage the further growth or acceptance of these behaviours across English football. This includes working with social media platforms to establish new ways of quicker removal of fan-generated videos of illegal behaviour at football matches, including violent offences and pitch invasions. It also includes asking the Government to reform regulations to restrict the supply of pyrotechnics and smoke bombs.    \n \n \n There are new measures and strong sanctions to tackle the increased anti-social and criminal behaviours recently seen in football grounds ➡️  https://t.co/Lsk7Qnlayp #LoveFootball  |  #ProtectTheGame   pic.twitter.com/zAdxFa6LaG \n— Premier League (@premierleague)  August 5, 2022 \n \n Premier League Chief Executive Richard Masters said:  “Everyone should feel safe and able to enjoy a football match. Together, with clubs and partners across football, we are making clear the type of incidents we saw last season must stop. If we don’t take collective and sustained action, it may only be a matter of time before someone is seriously injured, or worse.    \n \"These new measures are a strong response to a significant increase in fan behaviour issues, but we know it is the minority who have behaved unacceptably and unlawfully. Premier League football should be a fantastic experience for everyone and we don’t want matches to be marred by these sorts of events in the future.”   \n FA Chief Executive Mark Bullingham said:  \"We all know about the fantastic and unique role that football can play in bringing communities together. However, the rise in anti-social behaviour that we saw in stadiums at the end of last season was entirely unacceptable and put people’s safety at risk. Together, English football has introduced new measures and stronger sanctions, for the start of the coming season, to send out a clear message that we will not tolerate this type of illegal and dangerous behaviour. \n \"Football stadiums must be a safe, inclusive and enjoyable environment for all, and it is the responsibility of everyone in the game, including governing bodies, clubs, players, coaches, and fans, to ensure that we all play our part in protecting our game and each other.\"  \n \n \n \"Pyro and pitch incursions are illegal, you will be prosecuted and you will be banned by your club\" \n \n Football Supporters' Association Chief Executive Kevin Miles \n \n \n \n EFL Chief Executive Trevor Birch said:  “This season sees new measures introduced and sanctions implemented that will serve to remind everyone attending games - but particularly the minority of people behaving in an offensive manner - that there are real life consequences for the criminal, dangerous and irresponsible conduct at football. It is wholly appropriate that these unacceptable behaviours will now be dealt with through a combination of police action and automatic club bans. \n \"There is nothing like going to watch your team live and that is why the English professional game has taken strong collective action, to ensure the match day experience remains a safe and welcoming environment for all including fans, players, club staff and match officials.”      \n Football Supporters' Association Chief Executive Kevin Miles said:  \"We are contacted by supporters on a fairly regular basis who have been caught jumping on the pitch, or with pyro in the stands, and without exception they regret doing it.  \n \"Whether they had positive intentions or not is irrelevant in the eyes of the law - pyro and pitch incursions are illegal, you will be prosecuted and you will be banned by your club.\"  \n To support this new package of policies and actions, today marks the launch of an all-football campaign. \n \" Love football. Protect the game \"   will make clear the consequences of, and sanctions for, illegal and dangerous behaviour as we seek to urge fans to help us protect the game and keep everyone safe.    \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout's  panel of experts  reveal who they currently plan to pick in their 2022/23  Fantasy Premier League  starting teams. \n Lee Bonfield ( @FPLFamily ) \n Picking  Manchester City  midfielders can be a risky business due to \"Pep Roulette\", but Lee Bonfield believes he has found a secure and budget-friendly way to double up on the champions' prolific attack. \n He is planning to pick  Jack Grealish  (£7.0m) as well as  Erling Haaland  (£11.5m). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n \"This is a big year for Jack Grealish. He's got a lot to prove,\" says Lee.  \n \"I predict Grealish will be playing either off the left or around Haaland, and if Haaland is occupying those centre-halves that's going to free up space for the likes of  Phil Foden  [£8.0m] and Grealish to make their move in those spaces. At £7.0m he's worth a look in your FPL team.\" \n See:  FPL champion's tips: Keep playing Pep roulette in 2022/23! \n Lee is opting for a 3-5-2 formation featuring  Brentford ’s budget midfielder  Josh Dasilva  (£4.5m). \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the £100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n \"I call him an 'enabler' but I actually predict he’s going to get plenty of game time,\" Lee adds. \"We know that  Christian Eriksen  [£6.5m] is on his way over to Old Trafford. He's going to be missed by the Bees. \n \"If  Ivan Toney  [£7.0m] and  Bryan Mbeumo  [£6.0m] are going to get the same output that they saw last season, they're going to need someone to take the creative mantle off Eriksen. \n \"I think it could be Josh Dasilva so if you want him as your fifth budget midfielder enabler – at £4.5m he could be one of the bargains of the season.\" \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Saint-Maximin can star early on Part 2:  Havertz will be Chelsea's main man Part 3:  Bank on De Bruyne for bonus Part 5:  Experts' ultimate team for Gameweek 1 \n",

        "text": "\n Ahead of the 2022/23 season starting on 5 August, here are things you will see for the first time. \n Premier League 2 age-limit change \n From the start of the 2022/23 season, Premier League 2 will become an Under-21 competition. \n The amendment to the age limit, which was previously Under-23, has been introduced as part of an ongoing review of the  Elite Player Performance Plan  (EPPP) to better align with the EFL Trophy and international competitions. \n Clubs will be permitted to use five (previously three) over-age outfield players and one over-age goalkeeper, in order to transition from its Under-23 format. \n The aim is to continue providing opportunities for the best young players to play alongside and against older and more experienced players. \n Consultation is ongoing with clubs as part of a wider review of the Professional Development Phase Games Programme which will continue through the season. \n See:  Premier League 2: Competition format explained \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Five substitutes Part 2:  Nike Flight ball Part 3:  Match officials Part 5:  Law change for penalties Part 6:  New match postponement guidance Part 7:  Offsides Part 8:  Multiball system \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout's  panel of experts  reveal who they currently plan to pick in their 2022/23  Fantasy Premier League  starting teams. \n Holly Shand ( @HollyShand ) \n Despite being a proven Premier League performer and having already scored twice during pre-season,  Kevin De Bruyne  [£11.5m] sits in only 15.9 per cent of Fantasy squads. \n Yet his  Manchester City  team-mate  Erling Haaland  [£11.5m] is owned by over 58 per cent of FPL managers ahead of his debut campaign. \n One of De Bruyne's main attractions is his ability to pick up bonus points. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n \"I had to choose Kevin De Bruyne in my midfield,\" says Holly. \"He was the top-performing goalscorer for Manchester City last season. \n \"He always does really well in the bonus points as well. He was the top bonus-point performer across all players in FPL last season.\" \n Indeed, De Bruyne gained 33 extra points last term, despite only making 30 appearances.  \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the £100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n Holly is also going against the grain in her choice of  Tottenham Hotspur  attacker, opting for midfielder  Dejan Kulusevski [ £8.0m]. \n \"He's really impressed since arriving at Spurs,\" she adds. \"There aren't many players that scored more Fantasy points than him since his arrival in the Premier League. \n \"Hopefully he can keep pace with  Harry Kane  [£11.5m] and  Son Heung-min  [£12.0m].\" \n Kulusevski currently sits in around eight per cent of squads, while both Kane and Son boast ownerships of over 20 per cent. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Saint-Maximin can star early on Part 2:  Havertz will be Chelsea's main man Part 4:  Pick Grealish alongside Haaland Part 5:  Experts' ultimate team for Gameweek 1 \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout is helping  Fantasy Premier League  managers to build their 15-man squads ahead of Gameweek 1 with some ready-made solutions.  \n Owning three premiums \n At a combined cost of £36.5m,  Mohamed Salah  (£13.0m),  Kevin De Bruyne  (£12.0m) and  Harry Kane  (£11.5m) account for more than a third of managers’ £100m budgets. \n The trio were all ranked among the seven top-scoring players in the previous campaign.  \n And they have each been quick to get on the scoresheet over their clubs’ pre-season friendlies, further strengthening their claims for a role in early squads. \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the £100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n Is it possible to own all three without weakening your squad? \n The Scout looks at the best way to find balance in the budget in order to achieve this.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Goalkeepers \n Brentford ’s  David Raya  (£4.5m) and  Ellery Balcombe  (£4.0m) combine for a mere £8.5m ahead of a fine run of opponents. \n The Bees face only one of last term’s top six in the first eight Gameweeks. \n Defenders \n Despite owning the three big-hitters in attack, there is still room for popular premium-priced defenders  Trent Alexander-Arnold  (£7.5m) and  Joao Cancelo  (£7.0m). \n The duo also placed among the top seven scorers in 2021/22 Fantasy and are the two most-owned defenders this season as a result. \n They have the schedules to bring in big returns from the start of 2022/23.  Liverpool  and  Manchester City  each face just one of the top six from last term in their first seven outings.  \n Arsenal  right-back  Takehiro Tomiyasu  and  Wolverhampton Wanderers ’  Jonny  (both £4.5m) are among the standout budget candidates due to their favourable runs of opponents early on. \n Arsenal's first five Gameweeks \n \n \n \n GW \n Opp \n FDR \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n CRY (A) \n 2 \n \n \n 2 \n LEI (H) \n 3 \n \n \n 3 \n BOU (A) \n 2 \n \n \n 4 \n FUL (H) \n 2 \n \n \n 5 \n AVL (H) \n 2 \n \n \n \n Their potential at both ends of the pitch allows managers to start them every week early on in a four-man defence.  \n Meanwhile,  Neco Williams  provides a very handy back-up off the bench.  \n The Welshman is one of the few starters at an ultra-low cost of only £4.0m after moving from Liverpool to  Nottingham Forest . \n Midfielders \n Salah and De Bruyne are joined by a trio of midfielders who each cost under £6.0m. \n Wolves’  Pedro Neto  (£5.5m) and  Aston Villa  winger  Leon Bailey  (£5.0m) could provide strong value in a 4-4-2 set-up early on.  \n Bailey's goal v Man Utd \n \n \n Instant impact. 🔥  @LeonBailey   #ICONPerth   pic.twitter.com/KPNGxaoLv5 \n— Aston Villa (@AVFCOfficial)  July 23, 2022 \n \n Both have shone during pre-season, with Neto scoring three goals and Bailey netting twice, while the latter leads the Wolves winger by two assists to one.  \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), four of Wolves’ first six matches score only two, as do each of Villa’s first three. \n Andreas Pereira  (£4.5m) has soared in ownership after moving from  Manchester United  to  Fulham . \n The Brazilian, who is expected to play in an advanced central role for his new side, can be found in over 23 per cent of squads. He is the most-selected midfielder in the sub-£8.0m category, with Neto second on 20 per cent.  \n Forwards  \n Up front, Kane takes his place alongside  Gabriel Jesus  (£8.0m), the most-owned player in 2022/23 Fantasy. \n Arsenal’s Brazilian is found in over 60 per cent of squads on the back of three goals and an assist in his three appearances over the summer. \n \n \n 🥁 Introducing the Man of the Match…  🏆  @GabrielJesus9   pic.twitter.com/ymMNZahXM2 \n— Arsenal (@Arsenal)  July 24, 2022 \n \n The Gunners have an extended run of kind opponents, with six of their first eight matches scoring just two in the FDR.  \n Leeds’  Sam Greenwood  (£4.5m), meanwhile, is a handy budget enabler who can sit on the bench and help free up funds for the star attackers. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  Premium defence Part 3:  Spreading funds evenly \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout is helping  Fantasy Premier League  managers to build their 15-man squads ahead of Gameweek 1 with some ready-made solutions.  \n Owning two premiums \n Thanks to some kind pricing in Fantasy this season, managers can own premium priced players such as  Mohamed Salah  (£13.0m) and  Harry Kane  (£11.5m) and still have the budget to invest heavily at the back. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Selecting big-hitting defenders was a tactic employed by last season’s FPL champion, Jamie Pigott. \n See:  FPL champion's tips: Look for early value \n The US-based manager built a five-man defence consisting solely of players from  Liverpool ,  Manchester City  and  Chelsea  when using each of his Wildcards.  \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the £100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n Goalkeepers  \n Brentford 's  David Raya  (£4.5m) and  Ellery Balcombe  (£4.0m) combine for a mere £8.5m ahead of a fine run of opponents. \n The Bees face only one of last term’s top six in the first seven Gameweeks. \n Brentford's first seven Gameweeks \n \n \n \n GW \n Opp \n FDR \n GW \n Opp \n FDR \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n LEI (A) \n 4 \n 5 \n CRY (A) \n 2 \n \n \n 2 \n MUN (H) \n 3 \n 6 \n LEE (H) \n 2 \n \n \n 3 \n FUL (A) \n 2 \n 7 \n SOU (A) \n 2 \n \n \n 4 \n EVE (H) \n 2 \n - \n \n \n \n Brighton & Hove Albion 's  Robert Sanchez  (£4.5m) and  Jason Steele  (£4.0m), along with  Leeds United  pair  Illan Meslier  (£4.5m) and  Kristoffer Klaesson  (£4.0m), offer similarly priced goalkeeper pairings with favourable early schedules. \n Defenders \n Liverpool, Man City and Chelsea provide managers with attacking options who offer multiple routes to returns in Fantasy.  \n Reds full-backs  Trent Alexander-Arnold  (£7.5m) and  Andrew Robertson  (£7.0m) averaged 6.5 and 6.4 points per match (ppm) respectively in the previous campaign. \n Alexander-Arnold ranked third among all players on 208 points, while Man City’s  Joao Cancelo  (£7.0m) finished fifth on 201 points, more than any team-mate. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Chelsea wing-backs  Reece James  and  Ben Chilwell  (both £6.0m) were both affected by injury last term but delivered big returns when selected. \n James produced 6.3 points per start, while Chilwell recorded 7.9 ppm over his six outings under Thomas Tuchel. \n Midfielders \n Owned by a massive 56 per cent, Salah will be among the top captaincy picks in any given Gameweek this season.  \n He is joined by in-form  Marcus Rashford  (£6.5m) and  Pedro Neto  (£5.5m) in a three-man midfield. \n Rashford dropped £3.0m in cost from the start of 2021/22, more than any other player in Fantasy. \n However, his prospects have been revived by  Manchester United ’s new manager Erik ten Hag.  \n The England international has produced two goals and an assist over the summer, suggesting he could be a real bargain from the outset.  \n Rashford scores v Crystal Palace \n \n \n Practise what you play. Slick football for  @MarcusRashford 's goal on Tuesday 👌 #MUFC  ||  #MUTOUR22   pic.twitter.com/VpxmJUPjfm \n— Manchester United (@ManUtd)  July 20, 2022 \n \n Wolverhampton Wanderers ’ Neto is the fifth most-owned midfielder in Fantasy. \n He is found in 19.5 per cent of squads on the back of three goals and an assist over the summer.  \n Meanwhile,  Andreas Pereira  (£4.5m) is a very handy pick as a back-up substitute. \n He has delivered an assist in both appearances for  Fulham  since joining from Man Utd and has a share of set-piece duties. \n Carney Chukwuemeka  (£4.5m) is an example of a low-cost pick who will free up funds for the big-hitters early on. \n Forwards \n Kane has been the most prolific player in the league so far this summer, scoring five goals and also supplying an assist. \n Arsenal  star  Gabriel Jesus  (£8.0m) partners the  Tottenham Hotspur  talisman in a front two. \n The Brazilian has made an instant impact at his new club, scoring four goals and supplying an assist. \n He is the most-selected player in 2022/23 Fantasy, found in over 62 per cent of squads.  \n Similar to Chukwuemeka in midfield, Leeds’  Sam Greenwood  (£4.5m) is an ultra low cost pick who can sit on managers’ benches, allowing them to spread their funds elsewhere. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Own Salah, De Bruyne and Kane Part 3:  Spreading funds evenly \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout looks at the  Fantasy Premier League  potential of the summer signings ahead of the 2022/23 season. \n Jesse Lingard (NFO) £6.0m  \n Lingard’s move to  Nottingham Forest  from  Manchester United  could be good news for managers on the lookout for a bargain in  Fantasy Premier League . \n The 29-year-old failed to secure a regular role during his time at Old Trafford.  \n But he is expected to be a key figure in Steve Cooper’s starting XI, occupying a central support role behind a front two in a 3-4-1-2 formation. \n That could help Lingard return to his career-best form he showed while on loan at  West Ham United  two seasons ago. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n He averaged 6.6 points per match (ppm) over his 16 outings in 2020/21, scoring nine goals and supplying five assists. \n That fares well when assessed against the best midfielders in Fantasy last term. \n Indeed, only  Mohamed Salah  (£13.0m) and  Son Heung-min  (£12.0m) surpassed that average in 2021/22, with 7.6ppm and 7.4 ppm respectively. \n Forest’s early schedule gives Lingard the chance to immediately impress, with Cooper’s side avoiding all of last season’s top six in their first three matches. \n If Lingard can rediscover his Hammers’ form, he could prove outstanding value over the 2022/23 campaign. \n See:  The Scout's FPL new signings \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout assesses the best players for managers to consider for opening  Fantasy Premier League  squads, according to price, position and early schedule. \n Mohamed Salah (LIV) £13.0m \n Liverpool’ s Egyptian is the most popular midfielder in Fantasy and third overall, found in 57.8 per cent of squads. \n Salah was the top-scoring player in 2021/22 on 265 points, the fifth successive season he has produced 230+ points. \n He also boasted the greatest goal threat of any player last term. His 139 shots, 113 efforts in the box, 37 big chances and 55 shots on target were all league-leading totals. \n Liverpool’s favourable early schedule means Salah is bound to be among the most-captained players in the opening Gameweeks.  \n They face just one of last season’s top six teams in their first seven matches. \n Liverpool's first seven Gameweeks \n \n \n \n GW \n Opp \n FDR \n GW \n Opp \n FDR \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n FUL (A) \n 2 \n 5 \n NEW (H) \n 3 \n \n \n 2 \n CRY (H) \n 2 \n 6 \n EVE (A) \n 2 \n \n \n 3 \n MUN (A) \n 4 \n 7 \n WOL (H) \n 2 \n \n \n 4 \n BOU (H) \n 2 \n - \n   \n   \n \n \n \n Luis Diaz (LIV) £8.0m \n The Colombian has also emerged as a popular pick as a result of the Reds’ kind run of opponents. \n Diaz is the second most-owned midfielder in Fantasy, found in over 30 per cent of squads. \n The departure of Sadio Mane, combined with doubts over the fitness of  Diogo Jota  (£9.0m), lifts Diaz’s prospects of securing the role on Liverpool’s left flank and hands him the chance to deliver big hauls from the very start of the season.  \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the £100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n Kevin De Bruyne (MCI) £12.0m \n Manchester City ’s playmaker has wasted no time in reminding managers of his potential. \n De Bruyne scored both his side’s goals in their first friendly of the summer, a 2-1 win over Club America. \n Crucially, the champions are the only side to avoid all of last season’s top six sides in their first six matches. \n De Bruyne goal v Club America \n \n \n Our Move of the Match 🚀💫 #ManCity  |  @Sure   pic.twitter.com/KWbXJJ0tEA \n— Manchester City (@ManCity)  July 21, 2022 \n \n Owned by a mere 14.9 per cent compared with the 61 per cent of Man City’s new forward  Erling Haaland  (£11.5m), De Bruyne can be a huge differential for the armband early on.  \n Man City's first six Gameweeks \n \n \n \n GW \n Opp \n FDR \n GW \n Opp \n FDR \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n WHU (A) \n 3 \n 4 \n CRY (H) \n 2 \n \n \n 2 \n BOU (H) \n 2 \n 5 \n NFO (H) \n 2 \n \n \n 3 \n NEW (A) \n 3 \n 6 \n AVL (A) \n 2 \n \n \n \n Son Heung-min (TOT) £12.0m \n The  Tottenham Hotspur  attacker was the most reliable player for bumper hauls in Fantasy last season. \n Son produced 11 double-figure hauls on his way to recording his career-high score of 258 points. \n The South Korean offers a very appealing captaincy option for Spurs’ kind short-term schedule.  \n They entertain  Southampton  and  Wolverhampton Wanderers  in the first four Gameweeks, as well as visiting promoted  Nottingham Forest . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Dejan Kulusevski (TOT) £8.0m \n The Swede is among the standout options in the sub-£10.0m bracket thanks to his all-round style of play. \n Having made his debut in Gameweek 24 last season, Kulusevski produced five goals and nine assists in 18 appearances for Spurs. \n Indeed, his total of 99 points during that time placed fifth among all players in Fantasy. \n Bukayo Saka (ARS) £8.0m \n Arsenal ’s top performer in Fantasy last term, Saka recorded his career-high score of 179 points.  \n The winger’s 11 goals and nine assists were also team-leading totals, highlighting his growing influence on the Gunners’ attack. \n Despite his impressive campaign, he is found in only 16.7 per cent of squads ahead of 2022/23, compared with the 60 per cent of Arsenal’s new forward  Gabriel Jesus  (£8.0m). \n That suggests Saka can thrive as a differential over his side’s kind early schedule. \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), six of Arsenal’s first eight matches score just two. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  The best goalkeepers Part 2:  The best budget defenders Part 3:  The best premium defenders Part 4:  The best budget midfielders Part 6:  The best forwards \n",

        "summary": "Sixty licences allocated for young female players to develop thanks to Premier League funding",
        "text": "\n The Football Association can confirm the first 60 Girls’ Emerging Talent Centre (ETC) licences have been allocated, which will feature the number of young female players engaged in FA programmes across the country rise from 1,722 to over 4,200 by the end of the 2023/24 season. \n These numbers also present a 59  per cent increase based on the actual number of FA programmes, going from 39 programmes to 60, enabling greater access for players across the country. \n Thanks to Premier League funding, The FA recently unveiled plans to grow its existing talent programme for women’s football with the introduction of up to 70 Girls’ ETCs, aiming to sustain its future and provide a wider and more diverse talent pool for the game. Today’s announcement shows positive progress has already been made. \n The national network of Girls’ ETCs will be aimed at girls aged eight to 16. The new Centres will operate for at least 30 weeks per season and will commence from September 2022. \n The Centres will be underpinned by five key areas: 1. Better accessibility 2. More inclusivity 3. Reducing the impact of early selection 4. More focused investment 5. Providing more appropriate challenges \n Earlier this year, the Premier League confirmed it will provide £1.75million per annum for the next three years to support the new network of Girls’ ETCs. \n Kay Cossington, The FA’s Head of Women’s Technical, said: \"Our key aims are to provide greater access for more players whilst diversifying the talent pool, and I am delighted that the early signs show that we are well on track to achieve those aims. \n \"We are extremely excited to be working alongside such a diverse group of clubs and organisations, which will help us identify players for the future, including future England Lionesses.” \n Premier League Chief Football Officer Tony Scholes said: \"The Premier League and our clubs are committed to developing football at all levels and it is important that girls across the country have greater opportunities to progress in the game. \n \"We are pleased to have provided the funding which will significantly enhance the pathways for young female footballers, and it is great to see the first licences allocated for the new Emerging Talent Centres.” \n Licences were allocated on a regional basis allowing for greater geographical coverage, whilst providing greater accessibility for a larger pool of players. \n The breakdown of confirmed licences can be found on The FA website.  \n In addition to those licences already confirmed, The FA will be staging a second invitational application window for eligible clubs and organisations in targeted areas to further support the aim of greater geographical coverage and access. \n For more information regarding the Girls’ ETC programme please contact  playerpathway@thefa.com \n",

        "text": "\n As Tyler Adams prepares to feature for Leeds United  against Crystal Palace in Perth , Adrian Clarke looks at the impact he can make. \n Tyler Adams (LEE) \n USA international Adams will hope his positive history of working under  Jesse Marsch  can help him make a strong early impression at  Leeds United .   \n \n \n \n \n \n LEE \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 1 \n \n WOL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n The 23-year-old excelled for the Leeds head coach at New York Red Bulls in MLS, and with RB Leipzig in the Bundesliga.   \n Expectations are high that his energy and all-action style will help compensate for the loss of  Kalvin Phillips  to  Manchester City .   \n It is perhaps unfair to make too many parallels between Phillips and Adams, who are stylistically quite different. \n Phillips was more of a box-to-box performer for Leeds and was happy dropping in between the central defenders to make something happen and play raking long-range passes.  \n Most of Adams' best work is done in the middle of the pitch, knitting moves together with shorter, sharp passing and busy movement.   \n Phillips and Adams compared \n \n \n \n 2021/22 \n Phillips \n Adams \n \n \n \n \n Minutes \n 1,596 \n 1,351 \n \n \n Completed passes \n 769 \n 792 \n \n \n Completed long passes \n 160 \n 73 \n \n \n Pass accuracy \n 81.5% \n 86.7% \n \n \n Pressures \n 504 \n 325 \n \n \n Tackles won \n 43 \n 16 \n \n \n Shots \n 15 \n 2 \n \n \n \n As a teenager, Adams was regarded as an aggressive and determined defensive midfielder.   \n In 2018, he ranked second for blocks (77) and third for interceptions (53) in MLS, while also making 54 tackles. \n Flashes of his combativeness were on display for RB Leipzig, and Adams will again work tirelessly to disrupt the flow of opposition moves.   \n However, his defensive numbers have been less eye-catching since arriving in European football.   \n Partnership with Roca  \n It is expected that Marsch will pair Adams with the left-footed  Marc Roca , who signed for Leeds from Bayern Munich earlier this summer.   \n The 25-year-old Spaniard is a deep-lying playmaker who can break the lines with his progressive forward passes.  \n \n \n 😤  @marcroca21   pic.twitter.com/oaXlc5CnXs \n— Leeds United (@LUFC)  July 17, 2022 \n \n Together, they will seek to provide tenacity, compactness and quality in and out of possession.   \n Across Europe’s top five leagues in the last 12 months, Roca ranks in the highest seven per cent for pressures per 90 minutes. \n Setting the tone \n As a bit-part-player for Bayern, he also averaged 70.6 passes a match, getting on the ball as often as possible from his defensive role. \n Marsch likes his teams to produce high-octane football and this midfield pair will be asked to set the tone. \n While Adams and Roca may be Premier League rookies, the duo have the athleticism, desire and technical class to be awkward opponents. \n See:   Talking Tactics: New signings for 2022/23 \n",

They are the only side to avoid all of last term’s top six sides in the first six Gameweeks. \n Man City's first six Gameweeks \n \n \n \n GW \n Opp \n FDR \n GW \n Opp \n FDR \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n WHU (A) \n 3 \n 4 \n CRY (H) \n 2 \n \n \n 2 \n BOU (H) \n 2 \n 5 \n NFO (H) \n 2 \n \n \n 3 \n NEW (A) \n 3 \n 6 \n AVL (A) \n 2 \n \n \n \n However, managers must monitor the new arrival’s fitness ahead of the start of the new campaign, with Haaland rested for the first of Man City’s three summer friendlies earlier this week. \n Jamie Vardy (LEI) £9.5m \n Home matches against  Brentford  and  Southampton  in the first three Gameweeks lift the  Leicester City  talisman's captaincy credentials. \n Despite being limited to 20 starts due to injury last term, Vardy still produced seven double-figure returns.  \n Indeed, his average of 5.9 points per start was more than any other forward in 2021/22 Fantasy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Anthony Martial (MUN) £7.0m \n The Frenchman has been among  Manchester United ’s most impressive performers this summer for new manager Erik ten Hag. \n He has scored once in each of his side’s three friendlies so far, thriving in the lone striker role in the absence of Ronaldo. \n Martial's goal v Melbourne Victory \n \n \n Right place, right time. @AnthonyMartial  👌 #MUFC  ||  #MUTOUR22   pic.twitter.com/3g0RsF7OBW \n— Manchester United (@ManUtd)  July 15, 2022 \n \n If he retains a starting role early on, Martial has the short-term schedule to offer managers strong value. \n Three of the Red Devils’ first four matches score just two in the FDR.  \n Brennan Johnson (NFO) £6.0m \n The  Nottingham Forest  star's all-round style of play makes him an appealing budget pick for opening squads. \n Johnson produced 18 goals and 10 assists last season, both team-leading totals.  \n Steve Cooper's side boast a kind short-term schedule on their return to the Premier League, avoiding all of last term’s top six teams in their first three matches.  \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the £100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n Ivan Toney (BRE) £7.0m \n The  Brentford  frontman was among the most prolific players in his position in the second half of last season. \n Toney scored eight of his 12 goals for the campaign from Gameweek 22 onwards, a total bettered by only two other forwards.  \n He can profit from a favourable run of opponents, with the Bees facing only one of last term’s top six in their first seven fixtures. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  The best goalkeepers Part 2:  The best budget defenders Part 3:  The best premium defenders Part 4:  The best budget midfielders Part 5:  The best premium midfielders \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout assesses the best players for managers to consider for opening  Fantasy Premier League  squads, according to price, position and early schedule. \n Leon Bailey (AVL) £5.0m \n The winger was a peripheral figure in his debut campaign for  Aston Villa  last term. \n Making only seven starts, Bailey managed a goal and three assists over the campaign. \n However, he has been a regular during the club’s summer schedule so far, starting each of their three friendlies. \n Bailey has produced a goal and an assist over those outings, strengthening his claim ahead of a hugely favourable short-term schedule. \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), each of Villa’s first three matches against  AFC Bournemouth ,  Everton  and  Crystal Palace  score just two.  \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the £100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n Andreas Pereira (FUL) £4.5m \n A summer move from  Manchester United  to  Fulham  makes the Brazilian among the cheapest starting attacking players in Fantasy this season. \n Pereira was handed an advanced central role behind lone striker Aleksandar Mitrovic (£6.5m) on his debut against Benfica last weekend. \n He made an immediate impact, supplying an assist for Mitrovic's strike in a 5-1 loss. \n Pereira has quickly emerged as the go-to budget midfielder for managers ahead of the new season. \n He is the fourth most-owned player in his position, found in over 22 per cent of squads. \n Pedro Neto (WOL) £5.5m \n Injury restricted the  Wolverhampton Wanderers  winger as he missed the majority of last season. \n Neto was a key figure for Wolves in his last full campaign in Fantasy in 2020/21, scoring five goals and supplying eight assists. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n His all-round influence that season is highlighted by the underlying statistics. \n Neto's 21 shots on target and 61 chances created were both team-leading totals. \n Wolves have been handed a kind early schedule, facing only one of last season’s top-six sides in their opening six matches.  \n Wolves' first six Gameweeks \n \n \n \n GW \n Opp \n FDR \n GW \n Opp \n FDR \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n LEE (A) \n 2 \n 4 \n NEW (H) \n 3 \n \n \n 2 \n FUL (H) \n 2 \n 5 \n BOU (A) \n 2 \n \n \n 3 \n TOT (A) \n 4 \n 6 \n SOU (H) \n 2 \n \n \n \n Yoane Wissa (BRE) £5.5m \n Wissa scored four of his seven goals for 2021/22, and supplied both of his assists, in  Brentford ’s final nine matches. \n He has continued that form into pre-season, producing a goal and an assist in three summer friendlies.   \n Owned by a mere 0.4 per cent of managers, Wissa has the schedule to prove a huge differential early on this term. \n Five of Brentford's first seven matches score only two in the FDR. \n Bruno Guimaraes (NEW) £6.0m \n The Brazilian was a huge success in Fantasy after joining  Newcastle United  midway through last term. \n Guimaraes averaged 5.5 points per start, combining five goals with an assist over his 11 outings. \n His all-round influence has already been in evidence over the summer, with the 24-year-old recording a goal and an assist over his two pre-season outings. \n Three of Newcastle’s first four matches score two in the FDR, handing Guimaraes the platform to become a huge favourite in the budget bracket. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  The best goalkeepers Part 2:  The best budget defenders Part 3:  The best premium defenders Part 5:  The best premium midfielders Part 6:  The best forwards \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout assesses the best players for managers to consider for opening  Fantasy Premier League  squads, according to price, position and early schedule. \n Ben Chilwell (CHE) £6.0m \n Chilwell was a huge success at both ends of the pitch in 2021/22 before he was sidelined through injury. \n Playing as a left wing-back for  Chelsea , he combined three goals and an assist with four clean sheets and five bonus points in his six starts, amassing 55 points.  \n Now fully recovered, Chilwell - who is owned by 11 per cent of managers - has the schedule to emerge as a major differential from the very start of the season.  \n Chelsea face only two of last season’s top six teams in their first 12 fixtures,  hosting Tottenham Hotspur  and  Liverpool  in Gameweeks 2 and 8 respectively. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Trent Alexander-Arnold (LIV) £7.5m \n The  Liverpool  right-back was the top-scoring defender in Fantasy last term, finishing third overall on 208 points. \n Alexander-Arnold was the most reliable player in his position for huge scores in 2021/22, producing eight double-digit hauls due to his many routes to returns. \n The right-back combined two goals and 12 assists with 18 clean sheets and 32 bonus points.  \n Despite being the most expensive defender this season, Alexander-Arnold has quickly established himself as a key pick for managers. \n He is the most popular defender in the game, found in almost 55 per cent of squads.  \n Andrew Robertson (LIV) £7.0m \n Liverpool’s best performer in the second half of 2021/22, Robertson bettered Alexander-Arnold by 117 points to 85 from Gameweek 20 onwards. \n Robertson averaged 6.4 points per start last term, near-identical to the 6.5 points per start of his fellow Reds full-back. \n That suggests he could prove a strong double-up option along with Alexander-Arnold for Liverpool’s favourable run of opening opponents. \n Jurgen Klopp’s side face only one of last season’s top six sides in the first seven Gameweeks. \n Liverpool's first seven Gameweeks \n \n \n \n GW \n Opp \n FDR \n GW \n Opp \n FDR \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n FUL (A) \n 2 \n 5 \n NEW (H) \n 3 \n \n \n 2 \n CRY (H) \n 2 \n 6 \n EVE (A) \n 2 \n \n \n 3 \n MUN (A) \n 4 \n 7 \n WOL (H) \n 2 \n \n \n 4 \n BOU (H) \n 2 \n - \n \n \n \n Joao Cancelo (MCI) £7.0m \n Manchester City’ s Portuguese claimed second place in the defender standings last term on 201 points. \n Cancelo’s one goal, 11 assists, 19 clean sheets and 27 bonus points highlight his potential as an attacking full-back for the champions. \n The underlying numbers further strengthen his appeal for early squads. \n His total of 81 shots placed top for defenders and was the highest by a Man City player in 2021/22. \n The champions also have a fine early schedule to lift Cancelo’s output. Indeed, they are the only side to avoid all of last season’s top six in their first six matches. \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the £100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n Reece James (CHE) £6.0m \n The Chelsea defender is among the best for producing bumper hauls in Fantasy. \n James recorded six double-digit returns in only 22 starts last term, claiming 18+ points three times.  \n See:  Koulibaly boosts appeal of Chelsea wing-backs \n Five goals and nine assists show his huge attacking potential playing as a right wing-back. \n As witnessed late last season, though, the versatile James may feature as a centre-back on occasion as Thomas Tuchel attempts to protect the 22-year-old from further injuries. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  The best goalkeepers Part 2:  The best budget defenders Part 4:  The best budget midfielders Part 5:  The best premium midfielders Part 6:  The best forwards \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout looks at the  Fantasy Premier League  potential of the summer signings ahead of the 2022/23 season. \n Kalidou Koulibaly (CHE) £5.5m \n Chelsea ’s defence should remain among the most reliable in the upcoming campaign. \n Thomas Tuchel’s side kept 16 clean sheets last term, a total bettered only by the 21 of  Manchester City  and  Liverpool . \n Crucially, Koulibaly’s statistics in Serie A last season compare well with those of his predecessor at Chelsea, Antonio Rudiger. \n Koulibaly v Rudiger \n \n \n \n 2021/22 \n Koulibaly \n Rudiger \n \n \n \n \n Mins/succ. tackle \n 61.7 \n 63.2 \n \n \n Mins/CBI* \n 17.4 \n 24.5 \n \n \n Mins/succ. header \n 50.1 \n 54.2 \n \n \n \n *clearances, blocks and interceptions \n Rudiger started 34 league matches in 2021/22, at least six more than any other defender for Chelsea, before joining Real Madrid this summer.  \n In terms of frequency, Koulibaly was quicker than Rudiger for registering a successful tackle, a clearance, block or interception (CBI) and a successful header.  \n The Senegalese also impressed in attack, producing three goals and three assists in his 27 outings. \n Latest FPL additions \n \n \n \n Player \n Position \n Price \n \n \n \n \n Wayne Hennessey (NFO) \n GKP \n £4.0m \n \n \n Thomas Strakosha (BRE) \n GKP \n £4.5m \n \n \n Djed Spence (TOT) \n DEF \n £4.5m \n \n \n Nathan Collins (WOL) \n DEF \n £4.5m \n \n \n Kalidou Koulibaly (CHE)  \n DEF \n £5.5m \n \n \n Tyrese Francois (FUL) \n MID \n £4.5m \n \n \n Cheick Doucoure (CRY) \n MID \n £5.0m \n \n \n Keane Lewis-Potter (BRE) \n MID \n £5.5m \n \n \n Christian Eriksen (MUN) \n MID \n £6.5m \n \n \n \n Nonetheless, at a cost of just £6.0m each, there is no doubt that wing-backs  Reece James  and  Ben Chilwell  are the best options in Chelsea's backline. \n Both offer strong potential for huge hauls thanks to their attacking output. \n James recorded six double-figure scores in just 22 starts in 2021/22, while Chilwell amassed 55 points over his seven appearances.  \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the £100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n Eriksen an option? \n Elsewhere,  Christian Eriksen  (£6.5m) could offer value as a mid-priced midfielder if he can secure a regular role at  Manchester United . \n The Dane produced one goal and four assists for  Brentford , having joined midway through last season. \n Eriksen's 29 key passes after his full debut for the Bees in Gameweek 28 was the third-highest total among all midfielders in Fantasy. \n See:  The Scout's FPL new signings \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout looks at the  Fantasy Premier League  potential of the summer signings ahead of the 2022/23 season. \n Djed Spence (TOT) £4.5m \n The signing of Spence   adds a second new wing-back to  Tottenham Hotspur ’s squad for the new season. \n The 21-year-old impressed while playing on loan as a wing-back at  Nottingham Forest  last term, producing two goals and four assists in the Championship. \n He follows the arrival of  Ivan Perisic  (£5.5m), who combined eight goals with seven assists as a left-sided wing-back for Inter Milan in Serie A in 2021/22. \n Latest FPL additions \n \n \n \n Player \n Position \n Price \n \n \n \n \n Wayne Hennessey (NFO) \n GKP \n £4.0m \n \n \n Thomas Strakosha (BRE) \n GKP \n £4.5m \n \n \n Djed Spence (TOT) \n DEF \n £4.5m \n \n \n Nathan Collins (WOL) \n DEF \n £4.5m \n \n \n Kalidou Koulibaly (CHE)  \n DEF \n £5.5m \n \n \n Tyrese Francois (FUL) \n MID \n £4.5m \n \n \n Cheick Doucoure (CRY) \n MID \n £5.0m \n \n \n Keane Lewis-Potter (BRE) \n MID \n £5.5m \n \n \n Christian Eriksen (MUN) \n MID \n £6.5m \n \n \n \n Spence looks set to challenge  Matt Doherty  (£5.0m) for the role on the right flank, while winger  Lucas Moura  (£6.0m) adds further competition, having featured in this position during pre-season.  \n Crucially, though, neither Spence and Perisic have featured in Spurs’ summer friendlies so far, which suggests both may be eased into action gradually at the start of the campaign. \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the £100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n While Perisic certainly offers more potential out of the two, Spence's lower cost means he could offer huge value if he can secure a regular role. \n In addition to his attacking potential, he joins a Spurs defence that thrived after Conte arrived in Gameweek 11 last season. \n The north London side claimed 13 clean sheets from that point, the third-most in the league. \n See:  The Scout's FPL new signings \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout assesses the best players for managers to consider for opening  Fantasy Premier League  squads, according to price, position and early schedule. \n Neco Williams (NFO) £4.0m \n The Welshman is among the cheapest starters in 2022/23 Fantasy after moving from  Liverpool  to  Nottingham Forest  this summer.   Williams impressed during a loan spell with  Fulham  in the Championship last term, producing two goals and two assists in 14 outings as a full-back. \n He now looks set to secure a role as an attacking wing-back for Forest this season. \n Managers have rushed to take advantage of Williams’ kind price. He is the most-owned defender in the sub-£5.0m bracket, found in almost 19 per cent of squads. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Takehiro Tomiyasu (ARS) £4.5m \n The Japan defender has emerged as a very popular pick thanks to  Arsenal ’s kind early schedule. \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), six of the Gunners’ first eight matches score only two. \n That has earned Tomiyasu an ownership of 16.5 per cent, the most of any defender priced at £4.5m this term. \n He produced a shot inside the box every 240 minutes last season, an almost identical average to the 238 minutes of his fellow full-back  Kieran Tierney , who is more expensive at £5.0m. \n Jonny (WOL) £4.5m \n Wolverhampton Wanderers  have one of the most favourable early runs of opponents, facing just one of last season's top six in their opening six matches. \n Playing as a wing-back, Jonny offers a cut-price route into a defence that kept 11 clean sheets in their first season under Bruno Lage. \n Jonny also boasts a reasonable attacking threat, scoring twice in 10 starts after returning from a long-term injury towards the end of last season.  \n \n \n Fantasy is live! \n Register now and use the £100 million budget to create your title-winning team! \n \n Register now \n \n \n \n \n Lewis Dunk (BHA) £4.5m \n The centre-back offers a cheaper route into the  Brighton & Hove Albion  defence than  Marc Cucurella  (£5.0m). \n Nine goals, 30 clean sheets and 41 bonus points in the last three Fantasy campaigns underline Dunk’s many routes to returns.  \n Brighton also have a kind early schedule, facing only one of last season's top six in the first eight Gameweeks. \n Kieran Trippier (NEW) £5.0m \n The right-back made an instant impact after joining  Newcastle United  in January. \n Trippier scored twice and collected one clean sheet across his first four appearances before injury. \n Having returned to action towards the end of 2021/22, he averaged 5.6 points per start last season. \n With his all-round potential, he can profit over the short term, with four of Newcastle’s first six matches scoring only two in the FDR.  \n Matty Cash (AVL) £5.0m \n The arrival of Steven Gerrard as  Aston Villa  head coach lifted the right-back’s output last season.  \n Cash combined three goals and three assists with nine clean sheets from Gameweek 12 onwards. \n His total of 108 points in that period was bettered only by the six top-scoring defenders overall in 2021/22 Fantasy.  \n Each of Villa’s first three matches score just two in the FDR, boosting Cash’s chances of a successful start to 2022/23. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  The best goalkeepers Part 3:  The best premium defenders Part 4:  The best budget midfielders Part 5:  The best premium midfielders Part 6:  The best forwards \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at the impact of players who have joined new clubs in the 2022 summer transfer window.  \n Taiwo Awoniyi (NFO) \n The signing of Nigeria striker Taiwo Awoniyi looks an ideal fit for  Nottingham Forest . \n During their Championship promotion campaign, head coach  Steve Cooper  settled on a 3-4-1-2 formation that paired star man  Brennan Johnson  with a strong, powerful No 9. \n \n \n \n \n \n NEW \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 0 \n \n NFO \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Awoniyi is extremely similar to  Keinan Davis , who proved the ideal foil for Johnson last term while on loan from Aston Villa. \n The summer signing scored an impressive 15 Bundesliga goals for Union Berlin in 2021/22, a side who averaged only 43.3 per cent possession. \n Leading the line for a Forest team who will also build their play for turnovers and counter-attacks, the former  Liverpool  forward's physique and running power means he has the potential to function equally well for his new club. \n Running in behind \n Eight of the 13 non-penalty goals the 24-year-old scored last season involved him racing on to through-balls with space ahead of him. \n Playing on the shoulder of the last man, waiting for passes to be sent in behind, Awoniyi was at his best when holding off defenders to score from 1v1 situations. \n Last season, Cooper's side turned defence into attack with incredible speed and precision, aided by a quick and mobile front two. \n The two-footed Awoniyi is at his best in a team who play this way. \n He does not have a record of scoring lots of goals from crosses. Instead, Awoniyi uses his strength and quality to overpower central defenders. \n Awoniyi goals 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Type \n Number \n \n \n \n \n Right foot \n 10 \n \n \n Left foot \n 5 \n \n \n Through-balls \n 8 \n \n \n Penalties \n 2 \n \n \n Outside the box \n 1 \n \n \n Tap-in \n 1 \n \n \n Intercepting backpass \n 1 \n \n \n Latching on to second ball \n 1 \n \n \n Finishing from square pass \n 1 \n \n \n \n Forest have also recruited a striker who likes to press defenders and force mistakes. \n Awoniyi won the ball back himself to start goal-ending sequences five times for Union Berlin last season. \n No other player in Germany's top flight could top that. \n Cooper's side will be eager to create as many chances as they can from regains made in advanced areas of the field. \n Bundesliga's most prolific strikers 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Non-penalty goals per match \n \n \n \n \n Patrick Schick \n 1 \n \n \n Robert Lewandowski \n 0.9 \n \n \n Erling Haaland \n 0.8 \n \n \n Anthony Modeste \n 0.7 \n \n \n Christopher Nkunku \n 0.6 \n \n \n Serge Gnabry \n 0.6 \n \n \n Taiwo Awoniyi \n 0.5 \n \n \n Stefan Jovetic \n 0.5 \n \n \n \n Awoniyi scored 0.53 non-penalty goals per 90 minutes last term, which placed him among the leading lights in the Bundesliga. \n With that kind of strike-rate it is easy to see why he was of interest to Forest this summer. \n The front man did spend six years as a Liverpool player between 2015 and 2021 and was loaned out to several clubs around Europe throughout that period. \n Despite developing well as an all-round player Awoniyi did not plunder more than seven league goals in a season for any of those sides, managing only 13 in 89 appearances across the three campaigns that preceded 2021/22. \n Last season was his breakthrough year, scoring 20 goals for Union Berlin in all competitions, including four in the UEFA Europa Conference League. \n To succeed at the City Ground, Awoniyi must hit the ground running and build on the confidence he has right now. \n From a tactical perspective he is tailor-made to shine at the top end of the pitch for Forest. \n See:   Talking Tactics: New signings for 2022/23 \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout pinpoints players who could be set to deliver their most successful ever campaign in  Fantasy Premier League  this season. \n Martin Odegaard (ARS) £6.5m \n The  Arsenal  playmaker finished his first full season in Fantasy as the 20th top-scoring midfielder last term, totalling 131 points. \n Odegaard scored seven goals and supplied a further four assists, in addition to collecting nine bonus points. \n The underlying statistics highlight his all-round influence on Arsenal's attack, with his 53 shots and 21 shots on target both putting him among their top three players. \n The Norwegian’s 77 key passes last season were more than any team-mate and placed third among all midfielders in 2021/22 Fantasy. \n And a major share of set-piece duties also lifted his creative potential. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Odegaard’s potential for assists in 2022/23 has been boosted by the arrival of centre-forward  Gabriel Jesus  (£8.0m). \n The Brazilian has been quick to make an impact over the summer, scoring twice on his Arsenal debut. \n Odegaard has been handed a favourable price tag this season, costing £1.5m less than Gunners winger  Bukayo Saka  (£8.0m). \n Arsenal's first five Gameweeks \n \n \n \n GW \n Opp \n FDR \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n CRY (A) \n 2 \n \n \n 2 \n LEI (H) \n 3 \n \n \n 3 \n BOU (A) \n 2 \n \n \n 4 \n FUL (H) \n 2 \n \n \n 5 \n AVL (H) \n 2 \n \n \n \n Arsenal’s early schedule gives Odegaard the chance to bring in big returns from the opening month of the new campaign. \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), four of their five matches in August score only two. \n Odegaard’s potential for goals and assists can make him a major asset for Arsenal in that run, establishing him as a strong source of value in Fantasy. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Kai Havertz (CHE) Part 2:  Kieran Trippier (NEW) Part 3:  Michael Olise (CRY) Part 4:  Jadon Sancho (MUN) Part 5:  James Justin (LEI) \n",

He attacks the ball with conviction, scoring five goals across two successful seasons with Rennes.   \n In a defensive capacity, Aguerd has shown great consistency in aerial duels.   \n Timing his jumps excellently, he was ranked second in Ligue 1 among defenders last term, for successful aerial battles won. \n Aguerd stats 2021/22 \n \n \n \n 2021/22 \n Total \n Rank \n Defender rank \n \n \n \n \n Aerials won \n 108 \n 6th \n 2nd \n \n \n Clearances \n 152 \n 6th \n 6th \n \n \n Headed clearances \n 114 \n 7th \n 7th \n \n \n \n Aguerd's combination of aerial strength and intelligent placement means that can be relied upon to clear danger from inside his own box on a frequent basis.   \n He should be a great asset whenever West Ham have to absorb pressure. \n Based on Aguerd’s dependable form over the past four seasons it looks like they have made a smart acquisition.   \n See:   Talking Tactics: New signings for 2022/23 \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout pinpoints players who could be set to deliver their most successful ever campaign in  Fantasy Premier League  this season. \n James Justin (LEI) £4.5m \n The versatile  Leicester City  defender was a big success in his last season as a regular before sustaining a long-term knee injury. \n Justin amassed 101 points in the 2020/21 campaign, averaging 4.4 points per match over his 23 outings. \n The full-back combined two goals and two assists with nine clean sheets and 13 bonus points. \n Having finally recovered from his period on the sidelines, Justin returned to re-establish himself as a regular towards the end of 2021/22. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n The 24-year-old started eight of Leicester’s final 12 matches, playing as a left-back or right-back during that run. \n Justin’s versatility could be crucial as he battles fellow full-backs Ricardo Pereira and Timothy Castagne (both £4.5m) for pitch time. \n If Brendan Rodgers has a fully fit squad, Justin is expected to occupy the left-back role at the expense of Castagne, with Pereira on the opposite flank. \n Justin v Castagne last two seasons \n \n \n \n Player \n Mins/shot \n Mins/key pass \n Mins/CBI* \n \n \n \n \n Justin \n 204.4 \n 109.5 \n 22.4 \n \n \n Castagne \n 297.9 \n 120.8 \n 26.6 \n \n \n \n *clearances, blocks and interceptions  \n The underlying numbers over the last two seasons further strengthen Justin's claim for a regular role. \n He has the edge over Castagne at both ends of the pitch, bettering him for minutes per shot and chance created, as well as clearances, blocks and interceptions. \n That all-round style of play, combined with his versatility, can ensure Justin enjoys his best-ever season in Fantasy in 2022/23. \n Tomorrow:  Martin Odegaard (ARS) \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Kai Havertz (CHE) Part 2:  Kieran Trippier (NEW) Part 3:  Michael Olise (CRY) \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout pinpoints players who could be set to deliver their most successful ever campaign in  Fantasy Premier League  this season. \n Jadon Sancho (MUN) £7.5m \n The appointment of Erik ten Hag as  Manchester United  manager can help the winger rediscover his best form. \n Sancho was a huge success for Borussia Dortmund prior to joining the Red Devils last summer. \n He scored 37 goals and supplied 41 assists in his three seasons as a regular in the Bundesliga. \n But he failed to replicate that output in 2021/22 Fantasy. \n Limited to just 20 starts, he managed only three goals, four assists and 91 points.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n The 22-year-old has dropped significantly in cost in Fantasy this season, down £2.0m from his starting price of £9.5m in 2021/22. \n That suggests he could offer strong value under Ten Hag, whose high-pressing tactics are more suited to Sancho’s style of play. \n Man Utd's first four Gameweeks \n \n \n \n GW \n Opp \n FDR \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n BHA (H) \n 2 \n \n \n 2 \n BRE (A) \n 2 \n \n \n 3 \n LIV (H) \n 5 \n \n \n 4 \n SOU (A) \n 2 \n \n \n \n Man Utd’s kind short-term schedule gives managers the chance to reassess their assets for 2022/23. \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), three of their first four matches score only two.  \n Sancho has the all-round potential to take advantage of that run and emerge as a key player for the Red Devils this season. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Kai Havertz (CHE) Part 2:  Kieran Trippier (NEW) Part 3:  Michael Olise (CRY) Part 5:  James Justin (LEI) \n Don't miss an FPL deadline again \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at the impact of players who have joined new clubs in the 2022 summer transfer window.  \n Armel Bella-Kotchap (SOU) \n Southampton 's new boy is a tall, quick and aggressive centre-back who likes to engage in physical battles with strikers.   \n At 20 years of age and with just 19 Bundesliga starts behind him from his time at Bochum, he is still a rookie learning his trade.    \n But he was highly impressive as a teenager in Bundesliga 2, helping the club earn promotion to Germany’s top flight, and he continued that progress last term. \n Suited to Saints  \n Under  Ralph Hasenhuttl , Southampton like to play aggressive football, and when they get that aspect of their play right they can be very difficult opponents. \n The Austrian likes his centre-backs to hold a high line, squeezing up to congest the space that rival attackers are trying to play in.   \n This positive, front-foot approach led to  Mohammed Salisu  (78) and  Jan Bednarek  (72) finishing 2021/22 as the Premier League’s top two for interceptions.   \n Unsurprisingly, Bella-Kotchap also excels in this area. He loves to get tight to front men and muscle his way past them to break up play. \n Across Europe’s top five leagues last season, he was ranked in the top three per cent for defenders making interceptions. \n Bella-Kotchap stats 2021/22 \n \n \n \n   \n Ave. per 90 \n Percentile* \n \n \n \n \n Interceptions \n 3.3 \n 97% \n \n \n Pressures \n 12.9 \n 91% \n \n \n Clearances \n 5.8 \n 89% \n \n \n \n *Percentile ranking among defenders in Europe's top five leagues \n The youngster uses his powerful frame to good effect, pressurising forwards as often as possible. \n This leads to the occasional error, where a striker will turn him to get goal-side, but Bella-Kotchap’s combative style is generally successful. \n Most aerial duels won in Bundesliga \n \n \n \n 2021/22 \n Club \n Headers won \n \n \n \n \n Konstantinos Mavropanos \n Stuttgart \n 81.8% \n \n \n Josuha Guilavogui \n Wolfsburg \n 77.8% \n \n \n Dan-Axel Zagadou \n Dortmund \n 76.1% \n \n \n Armel Bella-Kotchap \n Bochum \n 74.4% \n \n \n Mohamed Simakan \n RB Leipzig \n 74.2% \n \n \n \n Southampton’s summer signing is 6ft 2in tall and a dominant presence in the air.   \n He is comfortable on the left or right side of a centre-back pairing and wins the bulk of his headers.   \n Last season he had the fourth-highest win ratio in the air, prevailing in 74.4 per cent of his aerial duels.   \n None of Saints defenders Bednarek (70 per cent), Salisu (62.3 per cent),  Lyanco  (57.6 per cent) or  Jack Stephens  (52 per cent) could match that success rate. \n Scope for development \n It is easy to see why Southampton wanted to invest in this promising talent, who should suit their style of defending under Hasenhuttl.   \n He will instantly add competition for places, probably battling it out with Bednarek or Lyanco for a place next to first-choice centre-back Salisu. \n There could be the occasional bump in the road for this young defender as he adapts to English football. But his strong, uncompromising approach is likely to make him a crowd-pleaser at St Mary’s. \n See:   Talking Tactics: New signings for 2022/23 \n",

        "text": "\n The transfer of  Raheem Sterling  from  Manchester City  to  Chelsea  is a rare occurrence of a player moving from one of the traditional top-six clubs to another.  \n At Man City, Sterling won 10 trophies, including four Premier League titles, but he is hungry for more.  \"I've obviously achieved a lot in my career so far, but there is still so much more to achieve and I'm really looking forward to doing that in a Chelsea shirt,\" he told  Chelsea's official website . \n We have looked at five players who swapped one big club for another in search of silverware.  \n Eric Cantona   \n Leeds United  are not part of the traditional top six but back in the inaugural season of the Premier League, in 1992, they were the defending league champions. \n So their decision to sell Cantona to  Manchester United  was a surprise. The France international inspired  Sir Alex Ferguson 's side to four Premier League titles, including two league and FA Cup Doubles, to crown his enduring legacy as a Man Utd legend. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Teddy Sheringham   \n In June 1997 Sheringham left  Tottenham Hotspur  to join Man Utd as a replacement for Cantona, following the Frenchman's unexpected retirement. \n The 31-year-old England striker completed a fearsome forward line that comprised  Andrew Cole ,  Dwight Yorke  and  Ole Gunnar Solskjaer . Sheringham was an integral member of the side who clinched the unprecented Treble of Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League in 1999. \n Indeed, it was he who scored the stoppage-time equaliser that paved the way for their dramatic turnaround victory over Bayern Munich in the Champions League final. He went on to win two more titles in his four-season spell with the Red Devils. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Sol Campbell  \n In the summer of 2001, Campbell stunned the footballing world by leaving Spurs to join north London rivals  Arsenal  on a free transfer. \n Campbell justified his controversial and ambitious move by winning two Premier League titles and FA Cups, including a Double, as well as establishing himself as one of the \"Invincibles\", who went unbeaten for the entirety of the 2003/04 season. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Ashley Cole   \n In 2006, after seven seasons at Arsenal, Cole swapped the red of the Gunners for Chelsea blue. \n His decision to join a club he believed to be better placed to win major honours was rewarded by a third Premier League title in 2009/10 as well as four more FA Cups – taking his total to a record seven for a player. \n He also helped Chelsea win the 2011/12 UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League the following campaign during a glittering eight-season spell at Stamford Bridge. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Robin van Persie \n In the summer of 2012, after eight seasons at Arsenal and back-to-back Golden Boots, Van Persie decided to pass up his Gunners captaincy and make the move to Man Utd. \n The Netherlands striker's impact at Old Trafford was instant, as he scored 26 Premier League goals to help United win the 2012/13 title. \n He memorably struck all the goals in a  3-0 victory over Aston Villa  that sealed the title, including a thunderous volley for the ages. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout pinpoints players who could be set to deliver their most successful ever campaign in  Fantasy Premier League  this season. \n Michael Olise (CRY) £5.5m \n The 20-year-old was eased into action during his first season with  Crystal Palace  in 2021/22. \n Olise made only 12 starts for Palace, earning a further 14 appearances as a substitute. \n Due to his limited pitch time, he managed just two goals, six assists and 73 points. \n However, the underlying numbers highlight his major influence on Patrick Vieira’s side. \n When selected, Olise was involved in 44 per cent of Palace’s goals. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n That was more than any team-mate, bettering the 42 per cent of Wilfried Zaha (£7.0m), who finished as their top-scoring player in Fantasy on 150 points. \n Value option \n That impact suggests Olise can be a key figure for Palace this season.  \n Notably, he was a huge success in his last season as a regular, combining seven goals and 12 assists for Reading in the 2020/21 Championship. \n At a cost of just £5.5m, that all-round output can help offer managers major value in Fantasy.  \n Certainly, the Eagles’ tough early schedule suggests managers can afford to be patient, with Vieira’s side  visiting Liverpool  and  Manchester City  in their opening four fixtures. \n A kind run of opponents from Gameweek 5 then hands Olise the platform to announce himself as a standout budget pick for 2022/23. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Kai Havertz (CHE) Part 2:  Kieran Trippier (NEW) Part 4:  Jadon Sancho (MUN) Part 5:  James Justin (LEI) \n Don't miss an FPL deadline again \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout looks at the  Fantasy Premier League  potential of the summer signings ahead of the 2022/23 season. \n Raheem Sterling (CHE) £10.0m \n The winger's move to  Chelsea  can shake up the premium midfield bracket. \n Sterling was largely overlooked by Fantasy managers last term due to Pep Guardiola’s rotation at  Manchester City . \n The England international was limited to only 23 starts in 2021/22, earning a further seven outings as a substitute. \n However, he is now expected to secure a regular role for Chelsea as a replacement for  Timo Werner  (£8.0m) on the left of Thomas Tuchel’s front three. \n Sterling v Chelsea’s attackers in 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Goals \n Assists \n Mins per G/A \n Goal conversion \n \n \n \n \n Sterling \n 13 \n 7 \n 106.3 \n 22.8% \n \n \n Mount \n 11 \n 11 \n 107.2 \n 14.5% \n \n \n Havertz \n 8 \n 4 \n 150.2 \n 14.3% \n \n \n Werner \n 4 \n 2 \n 217.5 \n 8.9% \n \n \n \n The underlying numbers show why Sterling can boost Chelsea’s attacking potential. \n Last season he was involved in a goal every 106.3 minutes, scoring 13 and assisting a further seven. \n That was more than twice as quick as the 217.5 minutes of Werner. The German managed only four goals and two assists.  \n Notably, Sterling's clinical finishing was a huge part of his success. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n He scored with 22.8 per cent of his shots in 2021/22, the highest rate of any Man City or Chelsea player. \n Previously as a regular for Man City, Sterling produced 200+ points in three successive Fantasy seasons from 2017/18. \n With his pitch time looking more assured again, he could offer strong competition to  Mohamed Salah  (£13.0m),  Kevin De Bruyne  and  Son Heung-min  (both £12.0m) in the premium midfield bracket. \n See:  The Scout's FPL new signings \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout pinpoints players who can deliver their most successful ever campaign in  Fantasy Premier League  this season. \n Kieran Trippier (NEW) £5.0m \n The  Newcastle United  full-back made an immediate impact at both ends of the pitch after arriving in last January’s transfer window. \n Trippier scored twice and collected a clean sheet in his first four appearances before he was sidelined through injury. \n He averaged 5.6 points per start over his five Newcastle outings in 2021/22, having returned to action at the end of the season. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Newcastle’s defensive prospects were transformed after Eddie Howe was appointed head coach last term.  \n They had conceded in each of their first 11 matches with Steve Bruce in charge. \n The Magpies improved to keep eight clean sheets after Howe arrived in Gameweek 12, a total bettered by just five other sides. \n Set-piece potential \n Trippier also boasts strong attacking potential thanks to his set-pieces duties. \n He scored both his goals from direct free-kicks and has established himself as their No 1 for taking corners.  \n That all-round style of play suggests Trippier can surpass his best-ever total of 118 points in Fantasy this term. \n Certainly, Newcastle’s early schedule gives him the chance to reward managers.  \n According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), four of their first six matches score only two. \n Trippier can take advantage of that run, delivering points at both ends of the pitch from the very start of the season. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Kai Havertz (CHE) Part 3:  Michael Olise (CRY) Part 4:  Jadon Sancho (MUN) Part 5:  James Justin (LEI) \n Don't miss an FPL deadline again \n",

        "text": "\n As  Manchester City  start their pre-season campaign  against Club America at 01:30 BST on Thursday , Adrian Clarke assesses the impact their new striker will have in the Premier League. \n Erling Haaland \n Having played most of 2021/22 without a recognised centre-forward, Man City have filled the void by recruiting the best young striker in the world. \n Scoring 61 goals in 65 Bundesliga matches for Borussia Dortmund, Haaland is simply a force of nature who will frighten Premier League defenders this season. \n \n \n 🎥 FIRST CITY INTERVIEW 🎥 Watch  @ErlingHaaland ’s first City interview in full! 👇  pic.twitter.com/OAkf96Ltb5 \n— Manchester City (@ManCity)  June 13, 2022 \n \n Still just 21, the Norwegian is tall, strong, quick and absolutely deadly in the box. \n His arrival should help to take Man City to the next level in 2022/23. Everyone associated with the club will be eagerly looking forward to finding out his first opponents when the fixtures for the new season are released on 16 June. \n How Haaland scored in the Bundesliga \n \n \n \n Style \n Range \n \n \n \n \n Left foot \n 47 \n 0-6 yards \n 18 \n \n \n Right foot \n 9 \n 7-18 yards \n 42 \n \n \n Header \n 5 \n 18+ yards \n 1 \n \n \n \n Haaland has a devastating left foot that rarely lets him down. It is responsible for 77 per cent of his Bundesliga goals for Dortmund. \n He strikes the ball as powerfully as anyone but is also capable of producing delicate finesse in 1v1 situations. He is blessed with outstanding natural finishing instincts. \n Haaland's consistency in Germany \n \n \n \n Season \n Starts \n Goals \n Mins/goal \n \n \n \n \n 2019/20 \n 11 \n 13 \n 81.8 \n \n \n 2020/21 \n 27 \n 27 \n 89.3 \n \n \n 2021/22 \n 20 \n 21 \n 86.9 \n \n \n \n Haaland has averaged a goal every 86 minutes during a phenomenal two-and-a-half-year spell in Germany. \n In his first 18 months at Dortmund he never went longer than two league matches without a goal. His longest goalless stretch last season was five matches. \n Leading the line for  Pep Guardiola’s  attacking side will virtually guarantee that Haaland receives a glut of quality chances. \n Running in behind the defence \n Haaland’s pace and movement will give Man City a new dimension. \n When they use an attacking midfielder as a \"false nine\", City rely on slick interplay and runners from deep to exploit the spaces created. \n Haaland will offer more of a direct threat. He loves to make runs beyond the last defender and is at his devastating best when there is room to surge into. \n Out of his 61 Bundesliga goals, 25 have come from situations where he has run into space ahead of him to shoot, a 41 per cent share of his total output. \n Haaland's goal variety \n \n \n \n Goal types \n % of Haaland's goals \n \n \n \n \n Running into space \n 41.0% \n \n \n Converting crosses \n 31.0% \n \n \n Others \n 16.5% \n \n \n Penalties \n 11.5% \n \n \n \n Under Guardiola, Man City are excellent at getting into areas where they send a stream of low crosses or passes across the face of goal. \n That will suit Haaland, who has a nose for tap-ins. \n While his heading ability has improved this term, he scores more regularly when getting on the end of low crosses at close range. \n He makes clever movements in the box and is strong enough to brush off defenders to bundle the ball home inside the six-yard box. \n Getting the best from Haaland  \n I doubt Guardiola will alter his successful approach completely following Haaland's arrival, but there is likely to be a tactical tweak. \n This season, I'd expect to see City play a greater number of early, progressive forward passes for their signing to run on to, with the use of a \"false nine\" less prevalent. \n Haaland is a generational talent who can take the Premier League by storm when  the 2022/23 season kicks off on 6 August . \n His early summer capture is a real sign of intent from the champions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n See:   Talking Tactics: New signings for 2022/23 \n",

        "text": "\n As Raheem Sterling prepares to make his first pre-season outing for Chelsea  against Charlotte at 00:30 BST on Thursday , Adrian Clarke looks at the impact he can make for the Blues. \n Raheem Sterling (CHE) \n Sterling is a proven Premier League star with the credentials to be a great fit for  Chelsea . \n As he is able to shine in either of two inverted winger roles within  Thomas Tuchel ’s preferred 3-4-2-1 formation, or as a dynamic central striker, Sterling should have no issues settling in to a new style of play. \n Sterling is accustomed to solving problems against opponents’ low defensive blocks but will also fit equally well in a Chelsea side who place greater emphasis on transitions than he experienced at  Manchester City . \n The 27-year-old guarantees goals and assists, an area that Chelsea have needed to address since  Eden Hazard  left in the summer of 2019. \n Sterling's 2021/22 highlights \n \n \n 𝘽𝙚𝙨𝙩 𝙤𝙛...Raheem Sterling! 🌟 Watch  @sterling7 ’s most memorable moments from our 2021/22 season! ⏮  pic.twitter.com/WPCWJmpZQQ \n— Manchester City (@ManCity)  June 21, 2022 \n \n Provided that he receives quality service, Sterling should deliver plenty of major contributions at Stamford Bridge. \n Despite being consistently rotated over the course of the last five seasons, he supplied 112 Premier League goals and assists, 11 more than the aggregate of Chelsea’s leading contributors in each of those campaigns. \n Although there has been a slight downturn in the last two seasons, Sterling remains a huge threat inside the final third. \n Sterling & Chelsea direct goal contributions \n \n \n \n Season \n Sterling (G/A) \n Chelsea (G/A) \n \n \n \n \n 17/18 \n 29 \n Alvaro Morata 17 \n \n \n 18/19 \n 27 \n Eden Hazard 31 \n \n \n 19/20 \n 21 \n Tammy Abraham 18 \n \n \n 20/21 \n 17 \n Timo Werner 14 \n \n \n 21/22 \n 18 \n Mason Mount 21 \n \n \n \n Early on in his career, Sterling’s performances in front of goal were criticised, but working with  Pep Guardiola  helped to improve his finishing. \n He has shown greater consistency, with a ruthlessness in front of goal that has reaped double figures in each of the last five Premier League campaigns. \n In four of those five seasons Sterling’s conversion rate was ranked in the top 10 for players who scored at least 10 goals, never dipping below 20 per cent. \n Last season he was third for players who scored 11 or more times, with a respectable 28.3 per cent strike rate. \n Tuchel has recruited a forward who has developed a lethal edge. \n Players with 11+ goals 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Conversion rate % \n Total goals \n \n \n \n \n Son \n 33.3% \n 23 \n \n \n Vardy \n 31.9% \n 15 \n \n \n Sterling \n 28.3% \n 13 \n \n \n Zaha \n 27.5% \n 14 \n \n \n De Bruyne \n 26.8% \n 15 \n \n \n \n Romelu Lukaku ’s loan move to Inter Milan leaves Chelsea short of natural centre-forward options. \n While there is still plenty of time left in this window to fill that void, Tuchel may consider Sterling as a striker option to be deployed down the middle. \n He has sporadically performed that role in the past, but usually in more of a “false nine” capacity. \n Sterling’s positions for Man City* \n \n \n \n Position \n Matches \n \n \n \n \n Left wing \n 36 \n \n \n Right wing \n 18 \n \n \n Centre-forward \n 7 \n \n \n \n *over the last two seasons \n Sterling is arguably better when starting out wide and making out-to-in diagonal runs to arrive late inside the box. \n Towards the end of 2021/22 Tuchel used a 3-4-1-2 shape that featured twin strikers. This would perhaps suit Sterling more than playing up top on his own. \n Sterling’s most likely role will be on the left of a three-man attack, joining in as a second centre-forward at various intervals. \n Sterling & Chelsea 21/22 comparison \n \n \n \n Mins/goal (Goals) \n Touches in opp. box/90 \n \n \n \n \n Sterling \n 163.6 (13) \n Sterling \n 8.9 \n \n \n Lukaku \n 191.8 (8) \n Werner \n 8.1 \n \n \n Pulisic \n 214.3 (6) \n Havertz \n 6.7 \n \n \n Mount \n 214.9 (11) \n Lukaku \n 5.8 \n \n \n Havertz \n 226.3 (8) \n Hudson-Odoi \n 5.6 \n \n \n \n Provided that he adapts to his new surroundings, Sterling will enhance Chelsea’s goal threat in 2022/23. \n His pace and dribbling skills force defenders to backpedal, and this should help to provide added penetration for the team. \n Mohamed Salah  is the only Premier League player to have enjoyed more touches inside the opposition box per 90 minutes last season. \n Tellingly, in 2021/22, despite it being not one of his best, Sterling still scored at a much faster rate than anyone in Chelsea’s team. \n Wherever he plays in Tuchel’s forward line, Sterling will strike fear into Chelsea’s opponents. \n See:   Talking Tactics: New signings for 2022/23 \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout pinpoints players who can deliver their most successful ever campaign in  Fantasy Premier League  this season. \n Kai Havertz (CHE) £8.0m \n The Germany international has yet to find his best form since joining  Chelsea  in the summer of 2020.  \n Havertz has managed just 12 goals and 10 assists in his two campaigns in Fantasy, earning his career-high total of 112 points last term.  \n By contrast, he produced 29 goals and nine assists in his final two Bundesliga seasons for Bayer Leverkusen before moving to Stamford Bridge.  \n Nonetheless, the underlying statistics highlight Havertz's influence on Chelsea's attack in 2021/22. \n Playing mainly as a centre-forward, his totals of 49 shots in the box and 18 big chances were both more than any team-mate. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Havertz's role for the Blues means he has changed position in Fantasy this season, switching from a midfielder to a forward.  \n His numbers fare well when assessed against other forwards last term. \n His 18 big chances were surpassed by only three other players who are listed as forwards in 2022/23. \n His average of 230.8 minutes per goal was bettered by just six other forwards with a minimum of six goals. \n Enticing fixtures \n Havertz looks set to continue as Chelsea’s centre-forward this season, with Romelu Lukaku returning to Inter Milan on loan. \n And the Blues’ early schedule gives him the chance to make a big impact. \n Thomas Tuchel's side face only two of last season's top-six teams in their opening 12 matches. \n As Chelsea's main goal threat, Havertz can quickly profit from that run and make a big impact in 2022/23 Fantasy. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  Kieran Trippier (NEW) Part 3:  Michael Olise (CRY) Part 4:  Jadon Sancho (MUN) Part 5:  James Justin (LEI) \n Don't miss an FPL deadline again \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout looks at the  Fantasy Premier League  potential of the summer signings ahead of the 2022/23 season. \n Neco Williams (NFO) £4.0m \n Williams ’ move from  Liverpool  to  Nottingham Forest  looks set to hand managers a rare £4.0m starter in Fantasy this season.  \n \n \n \n \n \n NEW \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 0 \n \n NFO \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n The 21-year-old impressed during a loan spell with  Fulham  in the Championship last term, producing two goals and two assists in 14 outings as a full-back. \n Williams now seems likely to secure a role as an attacking wing-back for Steve Cooper’s side this season. \n His ultra-low cost of £4.0m could prove exceptional value in Fantasy and can be crucial in helping managers free up funds for their big-hitters. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Elsewhere,   Luis   Sinisterra  (£6.5m) arrives at  Leeds United  on the back of the most productive season of his career.  \n The Colombian scored 24 goals and also supplied 14 assists in 49 appearances across all competitions for Feyenoord in 2021/22. \n If his fellow winger Raphinha (£7.0m) departs Elland Road, Sinisterra can emerge as a big influence early on this term. \n Just one of Leeds’ first seven matches scores more than two in the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR). \n Wait for Aribo \n Southampton’ s new winger  Joe Aribo  (£5.5m) also enjoyed a fine season for Rangers last term. \n The Nigerian international combined nine goals with eight assists in 46 appearances in all competitions, highlighting his all-round style of play. \n Nonetheless, a tough opening run of opponents suggests managers can afford to wait until Saints’ schedule becomes more favourable in Gameweek 6, before considering their key players.  \n Further FPL player additions \n \n \n \n Player \n Position \n Price \n Club \n \n \n \n \n Omar Richards \n DEF \n £4.5m \n NFO \n \n \n Aaron Hickey \n DEF \n £5.0m \n BRE \n \n \n Clement Lenglet  \n DEF \n £5.0m \n TOT \n \n \n \n See:  The Scout's FPL new signings \n",

Indeed, they are the only side who avoid all of last season’s top six in the first six Gameweeks. \n Kane overlooked \n The rush to bring in Haaland and Jesus has made  Harry Kane  (£11.5m) a major differential. \n Fewer than 16 per cent of managers own the  Tottenham Hotspur  forward, who looks a strong armband option  at home to Southampton  and  Wolverhampton Wanderers  in the first three Gameweeks. \n Kane was a huge success after the arrival of Antonio Conte as head coach in Gameweek 11 last season. \n His total of 167 points from that moment until the end of the season was bettered by only two other players in Fantasy. \n Line up Liverpool differentials? \n Elsewhere,  Liverpool  pair  Darwin Nunez  and  Diogo Jota  (both £9.0m) have been largely overlooked due to the popularity of their team-mates. \n Reds trio Trent Alexander-Arnold (£7.5m), Mohamed Salah (£13.0m) and Luis Diaz (£8.0m) are all owned in over 32 per cent of squads.  \n Certainly, the arrival of Darwin from Benfica increases the chances of rotation in the lone-striker role at the start of 2022/23, with the Uruguayan initially expected to share minutes with Jota. \n Cheap options \n Finally, managers have turned to  Leeds United ’s  Sam Greenwood  and  Nottingham Forest ’s  Lyle Taylor  (both £4.5m) as a means of freeing up budget.  \n Neither player has been a first-team regular, which suggests they have simply been purchased to sit on managers’ benches, allowing them to spend funds elsewhere. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Most popular players Part 2:  Raya and Sanchez the budget favourites Part 3:  Premium defenders dominate Part 4:  Managers flock to Diaz \n Don't miss an FPL deadline again \n",

        "text": "\n More than 160 young people from across England and Wales joined forces this week to help tackle environmental sustainability at their football clubs, as part of this year's Premier League Inspires Challenge. \n The Challenge is one element of the  Premier League Inspires  programme, which clubs run on a weekly basis to support 11 to 25 year olds who are at risk of not reaching their potential as they move through the education system and early adulthood. \n The PL Inspires Challenge looks to empower participants to take on a social-action project and make a difference to the world around them. \n Young people were this season tasked with considering what environmental sustainability challenges football clubs might face. \n \n \n \"Through the Premier League Inspires Challenge young people have come up with some brilliant ideas to help build upon the great work already under way at clubs.\" \n \n Helen MacNamara, PL Chief Policy and Corporate Affairs Officer \n \n \n \n Having come up with their environmental social action ideas, participants joined a virtual celebration event hosted by presenter Anita Nneka Jones, where they shared details of their activity with teams of their peers representing more than 30 clubs from across the Premier League and the English Football League. \n \"It's great to see such a diverse range of projects which have been created to help drive environmental sustainability and really make a difference to the communities of these young people,\" she said. \n \"The enthusiasm and commitment to creating a more positive planet is incredibly heartening. I hope all the participants from this year's Premier League Inspires Challenge will continue to find ways to work together to positively impact the world we live in.\" \n The Premier League signed up to the  UN Sports for Climate Action Framework  last year and aims to reduce its own emissions by 50 per cent before 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2040, in line with the 1.5 degrees global-warming limit of the 2015 Paris Agreement. \n \"Environmental sustainability is of great importance to the Premier League and our clubs,\" said Premier League Chief Policy and Corporate Affairs Officer, Helen MacNamara. \n \n \n Congratulations to students from  @HarrisTottenham  who have represented us in this year’s  @PLCommunities  Inspires challenge, pitching their excellent business idea around football and sustainability to representatives from clubs across the league 👏🏻  pic.twitter.com/LwN7iNjZNA \n— Tottenham Hotspur Foundation (@SpursFoundation)  July 7, 2022 \n \n \"In November last year, the Premier League signed up to the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework, which brings together sports organisations from all over the world to achieve climate-change goals. \n \"We all must play our part in this important issue, and through the Premier League Inspires Challenge young people have come up with some brilliant ideas to help build upon the great work already under way at clubs, from stadium recycling initiatives to eco-friendly kit designs and developing green spaces in their local communities.\" \n Premier League Inspires aims to encourage young people to develop the personal skills and positive attitudes to succeed in life. \n Launched in 2019, it is supported by the  Professional Footballers' Association  and  The Prince's Trust  and has engaged over 435 schools and 18,000 young people to date. \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at the impact of players who have joined new clubs in the 2022 summer transfer window.  \n Sven Botman (NEW) \n Sven Botman is one of European football's most promising young central defenders, who will instantly enhance the quality of  Newcastle United 's backline. \n The 22-year-old Dutchman helped Lille win the Ligue 1 title in 2020/21, shining as a dominant centre-back who operates on the left side of a pair. \n Technically strong and comfortable on the ball, a by-product of his education in the Ajax academy system, the 1.98 metre defender should be an asset to the Magpies in and out of possession. \n Big figure at the back \n He is a physically commanding presence who uses his height and strength to good effect. \n In last season's Ligue 1 campaign, Botman won a hugely impressive 73.3 per cent of his aerial duels. \n That ranked him seventh in the division and it is a ratio that compares favourably with Newcastle's centre-backs from last season. \n Newcastle defenders comparison* \n \n \n \n Player \n Headers won % \n \n \n \n \n Jamaal Lascelles \n 74.2 \n \n \n Sven Botman \n 73.3 \n \n \n Federico Fernandez \n 66.7 \n \n \n Dan Burn \n 65.4 \n \n \n Ciaran Clark \n 63.4 \n \n \n Fabian Schar \n 51.7 \n \n \n \n *data from 2021/22 \n Botman will engage with strikers anywhere inside his own half but he is at his best when dropping off deep to defend his penalty area. \n When rival teams hoist hopeful balls into his domain, he backs himself to win his individual battles with opposition centre-forwards. \n Positionally sound, he confidently uses his powerful frame to win those all-important first contacts. \n During Lille's run in the UEFA Champions League (UCL) last term, Botman outlined his control in this facet of the match, ranking sixth for aerials won per 90 minutes. \n UCL's leading headers 21/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Aerial duels won/90* \n \n \n \n \n Gerard Pique \n 5.0 \n \n \n Jules Kounde \n 4.6 \n \n \n Virgil van Dijk \n 3.8 \n \n \n Merih Demiral \n 3.4 \n \n \n Joel Matip \n 3.3 \n \n \n Sven Botman \n 3.0 \n \n \n \n *Min five starts \n If he lines up alongside fellow left-footer  Dan Burn  at the heart of Newcastle's back four, it will be interesting to see which one of them is moved away from that side of the unit. \n Irrespective of that tactical call, head coach  Eddie Howe  will be reassured by their collective ability to repel aerial raids. \n Need to stay compact \n Botman's height and sturdy physique mean that he does have limitations when up against speedy forwards. \n In 1v1s in wide areas he can look uncomfortable, especially if opponents make him twist or turn. \n It will be down to Newcastle United as a team to ensure they do not become so stretched on a regular basis. \n If they stay compact, Botman will look a far more composed and distinguished central defender.  \n Tidy on the ball \n He will confidently carry the ball forward before making a pass, often driving towards the midfield before releasing it. \n Assured in possession, Botman was accurate with 88.1 per cent of his passes last term. \n He does mix up his distribution too, displaying a noticeable improvement in his long-range passing for Lille in 2021/22. \n Completing 77.7 per cent of his long passes, compared with 71.6 per cent in their title-winning campaign, he can accurately pick out a forward from distance. \n He is a modern defender with a string of attributes that should help make Newcastle a stronger team this season. \n See:   Talking Tactics: New signings for 2022/23 \n",

        "text": "\n There are a number of tools for  Fantasy Premier League  that offer managers further insight into their squads and potential transfer targets. \n The ICT Index can help you analyse player performance from an FPL perspective. \n Alongside this is the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  tool (FDR). \n The FDR provides an immediate view of the difficulty of forthcoming fixtures for your players. \n It is based on a complex algorithm that analyses the performance statistics for each team across their home and away matches. It then combines this data with each team's home and away form over the past six fixtures.  \n This creates a value that offers a perceived difficulty for each team when facing them home and away. \n These values are then simplified into ratings from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest difficulty value. \n Red alert \n If you view information for any player, either in your squad or in the player list, and check out their fixtures, you will see the FDR represented. \n Colour coding is used to help portray the FDR value, with green depicting a low-difficulty fixture and red the highest. \n The ratings are reviewed after each Gameweek, although major changes will not be applied immediately until home and away form for each team is more established. \n Even so, the FDR provides guidance on players who enjoy runs of fixtures that could promote their FPL points hauls. \n Ahead of each Gameweek, articles will use the FDR to identify teams with such runs, to help guide your short and mid-term transfer decisions. \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout assesses the transfer trends of  Fantasy Premier League  managers since the game launched this week. \n Midfielders \n Mohamed Salah  (£13.0m) has quickly emerged as the No 1 target for managers in midfield, while his  Liverpool  team-mate  Luis Diaz  (£8.0m) is perhaps a surprise place behind him in the rankings. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n The Egyptian is owned by over 59 per cent, nearly twice the number of any other player in his position in Fantasy. \n The top-scoring player in 2021/22 Fantasy, Salah has amassed 230+ points in each of his five seasons at Anfield. \n Ten most-owned midfielders in Fantasy \n \n \n \n Player \n Price \n Ownership \n \n \n \n \n Salah \n £13.0m \n 59.6% \n \n \n Diaz \n £8.0m \n 31.8% \n \n \n Son \n £12.0m \n 25.9% \n \n \n Neto \n £5.5m \n 22.5% \n \n \n Guimaraes \n £6.0m \n 22.0% \n \n \n Coutinho \n £7.0m \n 20.7% \n \n \n Saka \n £8.0m \n 17.3% \n \n \n De Bruyne \n £12.0m \n 14.5% \n \n \n Martinelli \n £6.0m \n 14.4% \n \n \n Andreas \n £4.5m \n 14.0% \n \n \n \n *information correct as of 10 July \n Salah boasted the greatest goal threat of any player last term. His 139 shots, 113 efforts in the box, 37 big chances and 55 shots on target were all league-leading totals. \n He looks a standout armband option for Liverpool's opening run of matches, with Jurgen Klopp’s side  facing just one of last season’s top six in the first seven Gameweeks . \n Salah hat-trick v Man Utd \n \n \n A scintillating performance at Old Trafford back in October, which included a  @MoSalah  masterclass ⚽⚽⚽ #LIVMUN   pic.twitter.com/7QAUU5QIT7 \n— Liverpool FC (@LFC)  April 18, 2022 \n \n That kind schedule has also lifted the appeal of Diaz. \n The Colombian is the second most-owned midfielder, selected in almost 32 per cent of squads. \n Son rises, De Bruyne drops \n Son Heung-min  (£12.0m) is also proving popular after delivering his best-ever season in 2021/22. \n Tottenham Hotspur ’s South Korean claimed a league-high 11 double-figure hauls on his way to earning 258 points.  \n His fellow big-hitter  Kevin De Bruyne  (£12.0m) has mainly been overlooked, though. \n Just over 14 per cent of managers are backing the Belgian due to the popularity of  Manchester City ’s new forward  Erling Haaland  (£11.5m), who is found in 65 per cent of squads. \n Good value elsewhere \n Pedro Neto  (£5.5m),  Bruno Guimaraes  (£6.0m) and  Gabriel Martinelli  (£6.0m) all have the schedules to provide early value. \n Neto's  Wolverhampton Wanderers  face only one of last season’s top six in the first six Gameweeks. \n Guimaraes averaged 5.5 points per start after moving to  Newcastle United  in January last season. According to the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR), four of the Magpies’ first six matches score only two. \n Martinelli can be found in over 14 per cent of squads, just behind the 17 per cent of his more expensive team-mate  Bukayo Saka  (£8.0m). \n Six of Arsenal’s opening eight matches score just two in the FDR.  \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Most popular players Part 2:  Raya and Sanchez the budget favourites Part 3:  Premium defenders dominate Part 5:  Jesus debut double turns heads \n Don't miss an FPL deadline again \n",

        "text": "\n There are a number of features on the  Fantasy Premier League  website and the Premier League app to help managers make their weekly decisions. \n FDR tab \n The  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR) provides an immediate view for managers of the potential difficulty of future fixtures for their present or targeted players.  \n You can access it on the web by going to the Fixtures tab and clicking on \"FDR\" or via the main menu of the app. \n ICT Index \n You can now view the ICT Index scores for 2022/23 on any player information screen accessed via the 'I' icons next to each player profile in Fantasy. \n The ICT Index uses match event data to generate a single score for three key areas – Influence, Creativity and Threat  – with these figures combining to create an individual’s overall score. \n It condenses more than 40 match event statistics into four distinct scores. These offer a view on player performance for factors that are known to produce FPL points. \n The Index is also available within the dropdown as a filter on the Transfers page and in the tables under the Statistics tab. \n Set-piece takers \n You can now find out who is on the all-important penalties, free-kicks and corners for each of the 20 clubs. \n On a web page, click on \"The Scout\" tab and \"Set Pieces \" while on the app go to the \"Set Piece Takers\" button on the main menu of the FPL section. \n This is updated regularly so you can stay on top of which players might deliver extra points.  \n Team news \n As each Gameweek deadline gets to within 24 hours, you will be able to see the latest team news from the clubs by clicking on the \"Team News\" tab on web or via the app on the main menu. \n Podcast \n Each Wednesday the  Official Fantasy Premier League podcast  provides managers with useful tips ahead of their team selections. It can now be easily accessed by clicking the \"Podcast\" tab across the top of the FPL site and \"Official FPL Podcast\" on the main menu of the app. \n Check out all of the features on  fantasy.premierleague.com  now.  \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at the impact of players who have joined new clubs in the 2022 summer transfer window.  \n Richarlison (TOT) \n Antonio Conte ’s acquisition of Richarlison will offer him the opportunity to rest and rotate  Tottenham Hotspur ’s forward line without weakening it in 2022/23.   \n The Brazilian has strong pedigree at the highest level, reaching double figures for Premier League goals in three of his four seasons with  Everton . \n \n \n \n \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 1 \n \n SOU \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n In addition to providing competition for places, he also offers tactical flexibility to the Spurs head coach.   \n Richarlison played as a striker in 51 per cent of his matches at Everton. But he also occupied a left-sided forward role in a further 27 per cent, and was a right-sided forward in 14 per cent. \n Spurs' new boy is good enough to deliver effective performances out wide or down the middle this season.   \n Effective in front of goal \n Richarlison is predominantly right-footed but has consistently shown he is capable of scoring in a variety of ways. \n During his four-year spell at Goodison Park the South American star regularly chipped in with headed goals, or finishes with his weaker left foot. \n Richarlison's last four seasons \n \n \n \n Goal type \n 18/19 \n 19/20 \n 20/21 \n 21/22 \n Ave. \n \n \n \n \n Left foot \n 4 \n 5 \n 0 \n 2 \n 2.8 \n \n \n Right foot \n 7 \n 3 \n 5 \n 6 \n 5.3 \n \n \n Header \n 2 \n 4 \n 2 \n 2 \n 2.5 \n \n \n Total \n 13 \n 12 \n 7 \n 10 \n 10.8 \n \n \n Conversion rate \n 22.8% \n 19.7% \n 11.7% \n 21.7% \n 19.0% \n \n \n \n From an aerial perspective Richarlison’s arrival should make a tremendous difference. \n Although  Lucas Moura  has a good spring,  Harry Kane  virtually carried a sole aerial threat in recent seasons. \n Richarlison has always been outstanding at attacking crosses with his head, so there will be extra encouragement for Spurs' wing-backs to supply a stream of deliveries into the box. \n \n \n 🎙 “I always said it was my dream to play in the Champions League, now this dream will come true” Richarlison's first interview as a Spurs player! 🤩  pic.twitter.com/tBSOXoiuKy \n— Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial)  July 9, 2022 \n \n When Richarlison plays as a striker instead of Kane, the team will not lose an aerial presence. \n If he occupies a wide berth in the same side as the England captain, he will be a major threat at the far post, too. \n Fellow newcomer  Ivan Perisic  is a terrific crosser, and the Croat would love to have twin targets to aim at when he sends the ball into the box. \n Comparison with Spurs forwards \n \n \n \n 2021/22 \n Headed shots \n Aerial duels won \n \n \n \n \n Kane \n 21 \n 75 \n \n \n Richarlison \n 12 \n 66 \n \n \n Lucas \n 8 \n 48 \n \n \n Son \n 3 \n 16 \n \n \n Kulusevski \n 0 \n 3 \n \n \n \n Spurs were not recognised as a pressing side last season but Richarlison, who loves to close defenders down, will play a part in helping them earn turnovers in good areas. \n He made a goal for himself in a  1-0 win at home to Chelsea  last season, dispossessing  Cesar Azpilicueta  before scoring the winner. \n And overall, Richarlison won possession inside the final third on 24 occasions last season, more than any of his new team-mates were able to achieve. \n Richarlison goal v Chelsea \n \n \n The press. The finish. 👌 @richarlison97  👏 #EVECHE   pic.twitter.com/H20ueCW3HQ \n— Everton (@Everton)  May 1, 2022 \n \n In terms of pressures inside the attacking and middle thirds per 90 minutes, only two other Premier League forwards or attacking midfielders made more than the 38.2 averaged by Richarlison. \n They were  Pablo Fornals  (38.4) and  Emiliano Buendia  (39.4). \n Drawing fouls from the opposition \n Embracing the physicality of Premier League football, and always willing to run with the ball at his feet, Richarlison also draws a lot of fouls. \n Ivan Toney  and  Wilfried Zaha  were the only individuals fouled inside the final third with more regularity than Richarlison. \n Most fouls won in final third \n \n \n \n 2021/22 \n Fouls won in final third \n \n \n \n \n Ivan Toney \n 27 \n \n \n Wilfried Zaha \n 26 \n \n \n Richarlison \n 24 \n \n \n Bukayo Saka \n 22 \n \n \n Jordan Ayew \n 22 \n \n \n \n Kane and Lucas were both a long way off that last term, with 11 each. \n So, Richarlison's introduction to the side has potential to help Conte’s men win many more free-kicks and penalties. \n Match-winning moments \n Richarlison is not a prolific Premier League goalscorer, but he will bring added value to Spurs whenever he is selected to play. \n Fitting in with Conte’s physical demands may take time, but he has the talent to deliver moments of inspiration. \n The 25-year-old scored with an  acrobatic overhead kick at Norwich City last term , a  diving header against Watford , and netted a crucial  75th-minute equaliser against Crystal Palace  in a match that guaranteed Everton's top-flight safety. \n His signing adds much-needed depth to the Spurs forward line. \n See:   Talking Tactics: New signings for 2022/23 \n",

Just over 12 per cent currently own Chilwell, who recorded 54 points in his six starts in 2021/22 before being sidelined due to injury. \n Bargain picks \n Arsenal  pair  Takehiro Tomiyasu  and  Ben White  (both £4.5m) are also proving popular thanks to a favourable early run of opponents. \n The Gunners face only one of last season's top six in the first eight Gameweeks, raising the appeal of their cut-price defenders as a cheap source of clean sheets. \n Right-back Tomiyasu is the most-popular defender in the sub-£5.0m bracket, found in almost 19 per cent of squads. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Most popular players Part 2:  Raya and Sanchez the budget favourites Part 4:  Managers flock to Diaz Part 5:  Jesus debut double turns heads \n Don't miss an FPL deadline again \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout assesses the transfer trends of  Fantasy Premier League  managers since the game launched this week. \n David Raya  (£4.5m) and  Robert Sanchez  (£4.5m) have emerged as the most-popular budget goalkeepers for opening squads. \n Both can be found in around 15 per cent of teams, more than any other stopper under the cost of £5.0m in Fantasy. \n Ten most-owned goalkeepers in Fantasy \n \n \n \n Player \n Price \n Ownership \n \n \n \n \n Mendy (CHE)  \n £5.0m \n 24.0% \n \n \n Alisson (LIV) \n £5.5m \n 18.3% \n \n \n Raya (BRE) \n £4.5m \n 15.1% \n \n \n Sanchez (BHA) \n £4.5m \n 14.9% \n \n \n Ederson (MCI) \n £5.5m \n 13.1% \n \n \n Forster (TOT)  \n £4.0m \n 10.3% \n \n \n Ramsdale (ARS) \n £5.0m \n 10.0% \n \n \n Gazzaniga (FUL)  \n £4.0m \n 9.6% \n \n \n Henderson (NFO) \n £4.5m \n 8.2% \n \n \n Pope (NEW) \n £5.0m \n 6.5% \n \n \n \n Brentford 's Raya delivered 4.0 points per match (ppm) last season, an average bettered by only three other regular 'keepers. \n And the Bees' schedule gives him the chance to make an immediate impact. \n Five of their opening seven matches score only two in the  Fixture Difficulty Ratings  (FDR). \n Sanchez of  Brighton & Hove Albion  produced 126 points in 2021/22, joint-top with wing-back Marc Cucurella (£5.0m) among their defensive players. \n The Seagulls also have a kind run of opponents from the outset, facing only one of last season's top six in their first eight Gameweeks. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Overall, though, it is  Chelsea 's  Edouard Mendy  (£5.0m) and  Liverpool 's  Alisson  (£5.5m) who are the most-selected goalkeepers, after the former dropped £1.0m in cost from last term and the Reds star fell by £0.5m. \n Mendy has earned 24 per cent ownership as a value route into a Chelsea defence that kept 16 clean sheets in 2021/22, a total bettered only by Liverpool and  Manchester City . \n Alisson was the top-scoring goalkeeper last season, his total of 176 points surpassed by just four defenders. \n Nonetheless, the all-round potential of attacking full-backs or wing-backs from both Liverpool and Chelsea deters the appeal of investing in their No 1s. \n Grab club back-ups \n Owners of £4.0m-priced goalkeepers  Fraser Forster  and  Paulo Gazzaniga  should reconsider their plans.  \n They should instead double up on Brentford's goalkeepers with Raya and his deputy  Ellery Balcombe  (£4.0m), or pair Sanchez with his Brighton understudy  Jason Steele  (£4.0m). \n By doing so they would still have a starting goalkeeper if their first choice misses out. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Most-popular players Part 3:  Premium defenders dominate the charts Part 4:  FPL in demand: Managers flock to Diaz Part 5:  Jesus debut double turns heads \n Don't miss an FPL deadline again \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at the impact of players who have joined new clubs in the 2022 summer transfer window.  \n Gabriel Jesus (ARS)         \n For the first time since he arrived in English football, Gabriel Jesus will enjoy the status of being the main man following his move to  Arsenal , and it could transform him into a 20-goal-a-season striker. \n In each of his five Premier League campaigns, the Brazilian forward has always scored between seven and 14 goals. \n \n \n \n \n \n CRY \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 2 \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Judged in isolation, this looks like a relatively modest return, but the 25-year-old was rarely afforded the opportunity to build rhythm or match sharpness at  Manchester City . \n Pep Guardiola  handed Jesus an average of 50.6 per cent of the total match time on offer across those five years; a figure that should increase markedly at Emirates Stadium, fitness permitting. \n Jesus' last five seasons \n \n \n \n Season \n Goals \n Assists \n Mins per G/A \n PL rank \n \n \n \n \n 2017/18 \n 13 \n 3 \n 104 \n 8th \n \n \n 2018/19 \n 7 \n 3 \n 102 \n 5th \n \n \n 2019/20 \n 14 \n 7 \n 97 \n 4th \n \n \n 2020/21 \n 9 \n 4 \n 158 \n 31st \n \n \n 2021/22 \n 8 \n 8 \n 117 \n 9th \n \n \n \n The Brazil international is expected to line up as a centre-forward in Arsenal colours, a position he rarely occupied for City in 2021/22. \n As part of their title-winning side he performed tremendously well on the right of Guardiola's attack, delivering over 80 per cent of his goals and assists from that position. \n That said, Jesus should have no problems reverting to a natural striker's role, particularly in a Gunners side coached to freely rotate positions during the build-up phase. \n Jesus in Arsenal training \n \n \n Firing them in already 🚀  ❤️  @GabrielJesus9   pic.twitter.com/Azv9ezLcjJ \n— Arsenal (@Arsenal)  July 7, 2022 \n \n When he makes runs into the wide areas, he can deliver accurate crosses for team-mates to attack. \n Four of his eight assists were right-wing deliveries and, inside the box, Jesus has razor-sharp intuition. \n Timing his runs well as a matter of course, he is also quick to react to loose balls inside the danger zone. \n Stats inside the box 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Player* \n Shots on target/90 \n Player* \n Touches/90 \n \n \n \n \n Salah \n 1.7 \n Salah \n 10.1 \n \n \n Ronaldo \n 1.4 \n Sterling \n 9.9 \n \n \n Jota \n 1.2 \n Jesus \n 8.6 \n \n \n Jesus \n 1.2 \n Grealish \n 8.0 \n \n \n Vardy \n 1.2 \n Jota \n 7.7 \n \n \n \n *Minimum 20 starts  \n \n \n \n When you study Jesus' stats on a single-match basis, he compares favourably with the best forwards in the division for effectiveness in the box. \n Only three Premier League forwards manufacture more shots on target from close range, while  Mohamed Salah  and  Raheem Sterling  are the only players to have had more touches inside the opposition penalty area. \n The hardworking Brazilian, who also presses defenders diligently, will undoubtedly offer Arsenal added penetration in the final third. \n Last season  Alexandre Lacazette  frequently dropped deep in search of the ball but his replacement is far more effective when making runs beyond defenders. \n Mikel Arteta  has signed a dangerous and intelligent forward who should thrive in an environment where the team is built around him. \n Jesus has the talent and attitude to vastly improve Arsenal as an attacking force. \n See:   Talking Tactics: New signings for 2022/23 \n",

        "text": "\n Mohamed Salah  (£13.0m) and  Erling Haaland  (£11.5m) will be key targets during the unlimited free transfers period in  Fantasy Premier League .  \n In addition to two Wildcards this season, managers can also freshen up their 15-man squads when domestic action pauses for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. \n See:  What's new in FPL - Unlimited transfers during World Cup \n The unlimited free transfers period starts after the Gameweek 16 deadline on  Saturday 12 November at 13:30 GMT  and ends on the Gameweek 17 deadline of  13:30 GMT on Monday 26 December . \n Prior to this window, managers should look to employ the \"dead-ending tactic\"  favoured by last season's champion Jamie Pigott  to take advantage of the schedule. \n The American manager targeted teams with strong fixtures over the opening Gameweeks in 2021/22 Fantasy before playing his first Wildcard in Gameweek 8 to pinpoint favourable turns in schedules for  Chelsea  and  Manchester City . \n This season, managers can focus their transfers purely on the teams and players with kind matches leading up to Gameweek 16, before making unlimited trades immediately afterwards. \n Salah and Haaland are among a number of big-name players in Fantasy whose countries failed to qualify for FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. \n Those players who have benefitted from a break will be fresher and less likely to be rotated than team-mates who have played in the latter stages of the winter tournament. \n Liverpool to benefit? \n Notably,  Liverpool  have a number of key players at both ends of the pitch who won't feature. \n Salah's fellow winger  Luis Diaz  (£8.0m), along with defensive duo  Andrew Robertson  (£7.0m) and  Joel Matip , won’t take part. \n Crucially, the Reds have a very kind schedule from Gameweek 17 onwards. They face only one of last term’s top seven in their subsequent seven matches. \n Other options \n Haaland and Man City team-mate  Riyad Mahrez  (£8.0m) offer further options with the potential for huge hauls. \n Arsenal  pair  Martin Odegaard  (£6.5m) and  Kieran Tierney  (£5.0m), along with  West Ham United 's  Said Benrahma  (£6.0m) and  Michail Antonio  (£7.5m), will be fresh ahead of kind schedules for both clubs. \n Tottenham Hotspur 's  Dejan Kulusevski  (£8.0m) and  Crystal Palace 's  Wilfried Zaha  (£7.0m) will also not feature in Qatar and could prove popular during the unlimited free transfer period. \n See:  Fantasy Premier League 2022/23 is live \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout assesses player prices in 2022/23  Fantasy Premier League  and their implications. \n Nottingham Forest \n Brennan Johnson  (£6.0m) has the early schedule to announce himself as a major source of value for managers this season. \n The Nottingham Forest star was a huge success under head coach Steve Cooper in last term’s Championship. \n Johnson scored 18 goals and also supplied 10 assists, both team-leading totals. \n \n \n The first batch of  @OfficialFPL  price reveals have arrived. 👀 Who's going in your team, Reds? 💰 🌳🔴  #NFFC  |  #PL \n— Nottingham Forest FC (@NFFC)  July 4, 2022 \n \n Having earned the vast majority of his minutes playing in a front two in 2021/22, the 21-year-old is listed as a forward in Fantasy.  \n He is identically priced to his new strike partner  Taiwo Awoniyi , who arrives on the back of 15 goals for Union Berlin in last season’s Bundesliga. \n Forest’s opening three matches,  against Newcastle United ,  West Ham United  and  Everton , hand both Johnson and Awoniyi the chance to emerge as successful value options. \n Everton \n Meanwhile, managers will need to pay £8.0m to own Everton forward  Dominic Calvert-Lewin . \n The Toffees striker missed most of last season through injury but returned to top form towards the end of the campaign with two goals and an assist in their final three matches.  \n Calvert-Lewin could also be handed penalties for Everton following the departure of Richarlison to  Tottenham Hotspur . \n \n \n The first wave of our 2022/23  #FPL  price list has been revealed! 👀 @OfficialFPL  🔵  pic.twitter.com/Zes2CEBqF8 \n— Everton (@Everton)  July 4, 2022 \n \n Nonetheless, his relatively high price could persuade some managers to turn to midfielder  Anthony Gordon  (£5.5m) over a favourable run of early fixtures for Frank Lampard's side. \n Everton face  Aston Villa , Forest,  Brentford  and  Leeds United  in the opening five Gameweeks. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n See:  All 2022/23 player price reveals \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Saka rises after career-best campaign Part 2:  Haaland cheaper than De Bruyne Part 3:  Brentford offer early value Part 4:  Salah rises in price, Jota now a forward   Part 5:  Big drops for Ronaldo and Fernandes Part 6:  Wolves wing-backs can be budget favourites Part 7:  Havertz now a forward, Bowen climbs in cost Part 8:  Guimaraes can be a budget gem Part 9:  Son costs more than Kane, Perisic a defender Part 10:  Vardy drops in cost, Maddison rises \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout assesses player prices in 2022/23  Fantasy Premier League  and their implications. \n Leicester \n Foxes talisman  Jamie Vardy  (£9.5m) has dropped £1.0m in cost from the start of last season. \n The forward was restricted to just 25 appearances due to injury, totalling 133 points in 2021/22. \n Despite his limited pitch time, Vardy was still a huge influence, scoring 15 goals and assisting a further three.  \n Indeed, his average of 5.9 points per start was more than any other forward in Fantasy last term. \n \n \n Some Foxes 𝗺𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲𝘀 here 🔵 😃 Who's making your  @OfficialFPL  team in 2022/23? 👌‍  pic.twitter.com/SC6JT5XlNp \n— Leicester City (@LCFC)  July 4, 2022 \n \n James Maddison  (£8.0m) has risen £1.0m after recording his best-ever campaign in 2021/22. \n The playmaker combined 12 goals with 11 assists to tally 181 points, placing him sixth among midfielders. \n Vardy and Maddison were Leicester’s more reliable players for double-figure hauls in 2021/22, producing seven and eight respectively.  \n \n \n Magic  @Madders10  🪄 Some of his (many) best bits in 2021/22 🎞️ 🥰  pic.twitter.com/Qv5UfMuXrw \n— Leicester City (@LCFC)  June 3, 2022 \n \n They have the short-term schedule to reward immediate investment, with Brendan Rodgers’ side playing  at home to both Brentford  and  Southampton  in the first three Gameweeks. \n Harvey Barnes  (£7.0m) and  James Justin  (£4.5m) could also appeal as value picks in midfield and defence respectively.  \n Crystal Palace \n Elsewhere, Crystal Palace pair  Marc Guehi  (£4.5m) and  Wilfried Zaha  (£7.0m) are ones to monitor from the start of the season. \n Centre-back Guehi helped the Eagles to 12 clean sheets in 2021/22, a total only bettered by the top five clubs. \n He also boasted a considerable goal threat, with his 18 shots in the box at least three times the total of any other Palace defender. \n \n \n Some of our  @OfficialFPL  prices have been revealed 💰 Who makes your side? 🤔 #CPFC  |  #FPL \n— Crystal Palace F.C. (@CPFC)  July 4, 2022 \n \n Zaha, meanwhile, delivered his career-high haul of 150 points in his first season under Patrick Vieira.  \n The winger scored 14 goals last term, just one fewer than his combined total of 15 from across the previous two campaigns.  \n However, with  contests against Arsenal ,  Liverpool  and  Manchester City  in their first four matches, investment in Palace looks best-avoided until their schedule turns more favourably in Gameweek 5.  \n See:  All 2022/23 player price reveals \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Saka rises after career-best campaign Part 2:  Haaland cheaper than De Bruyne Part 3:  Brentford offer early value Part 4:  Salah rises in price, Jota now a forward Part 5:  Big drops for Ronaldo and Fernandes Part 6:  Wolves wing-backs can be budget favourites Part 7:  Havertz now a forward, Bowen climbs in cost Part 8:  Guimaraes can be a budget gem Part 9:  Son costs more than Kane, Perisic a defender \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout looks at the  Fantasy Premier League  potential of the summer signings ahead of the 2022/23 season. \n Gabriel Jesus (ARS) £8.0m \n A move to  Arsenal  gives Gabriel Jesus the chance to finally make a big impact in FPL. \n The Brazilian is set to become the Gunners’ first-choice centre-forward this season following the departure of Alexandre Lacazette. \n Jesus had struggled to secure a regular role at his former club  Manchester City  due to the rotation policy of Pep Guardiola. \n Indeed, he never started more than 22 matches in a single campaign across his six seasons under the Spaniard. \n Despite his limited pitch time, Jesus still managed eight goals and eight assists in his 28 outings last season. \n Jesus and Lacazette comparison \n \n \n \n 2021/22 \n Jesus \n Lacazette \n \n \n \n \n Goals \n 8 \n 4 \n \n \n Shots \n 64 \n 46 \n \n \n Conversion rate \n 12.5% \n 8.7% \n \n \n FPL assists \n 8 \n 7 \n \n \n Key passes \n 38 \n 29 \n \n \n \n His underlying numbers also look encouraging when assessed against Lacazette. \n Jesus was involved in a goal every 117.4 minutes in 2021/22, compared with the Frenchman's 162.6 minutes. \n \n \n Thank you,  @gabrieljesus9 ! 💙  pic.twitter.com/0IG7TqzZfL \n— Manchester City (@ManCity)  July 4, 2022 \n \n Arsenal's kind run of early opponents further lifts the appeal of investing in Jesus from the off.  \n The Gunners have one of the  most attractive opening schedules , facing only one of last season's top-six sides in their first eight matches. \n As the lone striker for Mikel Arteta's side, Jesus can finally make his mark in Fantasy, offering managers big potential for goals and assists in 2022/23. \n See:  The Scout's FPL new signings \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke highlights players who are set to build on a debut campaign full of promise and set alight the Premier League this season. \n Trevoh Chalobah (CHE) \n At the age of 22, following three loan spells away from Stamford Bridge, academy graduate Chalobah finally made his breakthrough as a  Chelsea  first-team player last season. \n Thomas Tuchel  handed him 17 Premier League starts in total, while also trusting him to feature in his line-ups for the finals of the UEFA Super Cup, League Cup and FA Cup. \n On the right side of a back three Chalobah was largely excellent for the Blues. \n \n \n A season breakdown: Trev Edition! 📚 His end of term report... 👨‍🏫 \n— Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC)  June 8, 2022 \n \n There were a couple of dips in form but overall the rookie was a big success, alternating with  Cesar Azpilicueta  in that wide centre-back role. \n With  Antonio Rudiger  and  Andreas Christensen  leaving the Blues this summer, we should see plenty more of Chalobah in 2022/23.  \n Progressive passing \n Chelsea's central defenders have the ball at their feet a lot more than most and Chalobah, who makes 71.43 successful passes per 90 minutes, is very comfortable with that requirement. \n If there is space ahead of him to run into, he will surge forward, but it is his willingness to look up and play a vertical pass that stands out most. \n Only a handful of other top-flight defenders can top his 27.8 forward passes per match. \n Forward passes in 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Defender \n Forward passes per 90 \n \n \n \n \n Adam Webster \n 34.0 \n \n \n Thiago Silva \n 31.4 \n \n \n Romain Saiss \n 31.1 \n \n \n Nathan Ake \n 30.4 \n \n \n Aymeric Laporte \n 28.3 \n \n \n Trevoh Chalobah \n 27.8 \n \n \n Virgil van Dijk \n 27.7 \n \n \n \n Only two defenders from the above list also make the top five for pass accuracy. \n Not only willing to take a risk by moving the ball in a progressive direction, Chalobah is also reliable in the precision of his distribution from the back. \n Technically, he is more than capable of excelling at the highest level. \n Best pass accuracy 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Defender \n Passing accuracy % \n \n \n \n \n Aymeric Laporte \n 94.76 \n \n \n Ruben Dias \n 93.38 \n \n \n Thiago Silva \n 92.75 \n \n \n Daniel Amartey \n 90.75 \n \n \n Trevoh Chalobah \n 90.62 \n \n \n \n Chalobah also provided a goal threat in 2021/22, scoring three times in Premier League action.  \n He drilled home a long-range strike on debut  at home to Crystal Palace  and followed that up with headers from corners  against Southampton  and  Norwich City . \n Averaging an effort on goal once every two matches, Chalobah has the potential to score between five and 10 goals this season if he earns a regular starting berth. \n Snappy in the tackle \n While Tuchel sees Chalobah as a central defender, he did enjoy spells as a central midfielder on loan at Ipswich Town, Huddersfield Town and Lorient. \n That versatility could come in handy for Chelsea during his second campaign as a fully-fledged member of the first-team squad. \n If the Blues need an extra body in midfield during the second half of a match, Chalobah could seamlessly move forward, or come straight into the fray as a midfielder off the bench. \n Central defender tackles 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Most tackles won per 90 \n \n \n \n \n Cristian Romero \n 1.90 \n \n \n Pascal Struijk \n 1.71 \n \n \n Trevoh Chalobah \n 1.68 \n \n \n Joel Veltman \n 1.50 \n \n \n Mohammed Salisu \n 1.42 \n \n \n \n Chalobah's background in midfield has helped him become a combative presence. \n Only two top-flight centre-backs won more tackles per match last term than the emerging star. \n It is never easy for youngsters to build on a successful debut season at first-team level but Chalobah should take great heart from his promising displays last season. \n If he continues to improve, Tuchel will hand him plenty more opportunities to shine. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Michael Olise (CRY) Part 2:  Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (LEI) Part 3:  Joe Gelhardt (LEE) \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout assesses the opening player prices in 2022/23  Fantasy Premier League  and their implications. \n Chelsea \n Kai Havertz ’s (£8.0m) switch from a midfielder to a forward is among the most significant changes in position in 2022/23. \n The majority of the German's minutes came as Chelsea’s most advanced central player in the previous campaign under Thomas Tuchel. \n And he seems likely to retain that role this term, with strike rival Romelu Lukaku having returned to Inter Milan on loan.  \n Mason Mount  (£8.0m) could prove more popular as an identically-priced midfielder. \n The England star produced 11 goals and 11 assists last term compared with Havertz’s eight goals and four assists.  \n However, the kind pricing of Blues wing-backs  Reece James  and  Ben Chilwell  (both £6.0m) is likely to drive more investment towards the Chelsea defence. \n Both offer major attacking potential under Tuchel. \n \n \n Time for an  @OfficialFPL  price reveal! ✌️  pic.twitter.com/UbYaggdVIm \n— Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC)  July 3, 2022 \n \n James delivered five goals and nine assists in 22 starts last term, claiming six sets of double-figure returns. \n Chilwell combined three goals and an assist with four clean sheets and five bonus points in his six starts, amassing 54 points.  \n Chelsea’s very favourable opening schedule further raises the appeal of their key players. \n They face only two of last season’s top six in their first 12 fixtures,  hosting Tottenham Hotspur  and  Liverpool  in Gameweeks 2 and 8 respectively. \n At a cost of only £5.0m, goalkeeper  Edouard Mendy  can offer further value for managers looking to double-up or even triple-up on the Blues defence.  \n West Ham United \n West Ham United’s  Jarrod Bowen  (£8.5m) has earned a big rise of £2.0m from the start of last season. \n The Hammers midfielder enjoyed his best-ever Fantasy campaign in 2021/22, finishing fourth in the overall standings on 206 points. \n Bowen’s improvement last season suggests he can still be worth that outlay. \n He was involved in 29 goals, scoring 12 and supplying a further 17. \n \n \n Some  @OfficialFPL  price reveals for you! 👀 Who makes it into your team?! ⚒  pic.twitter.com/DmpwtuKX5B \n— West Ham United (@WestHam)  July 3, 2022 \n \n That was more than double his goal involvement from 2020/21, when he produced eight goals and six assists.  \n A tough early run of opponents means managers should wait before considering Hammers players. \n David Moyes’ men face three of last term’s top four in their first six matches before their schedule turns kinder from Gameweek 7. \n A cost of £5.0m can also bring  Aaron Cresswell  into contention as an all-round pick in defence from that point, while  Michail Antonio  (£7.5m) could appeal as a mid-priced forward. \n See:  All 2022/23 player price reveals \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Saka rises after career-best campaign Part 2:  Haaland cheaper than De Bruyne Part 3:  Brentford offer early value Part 4:  Salah rises in price, Jota now a forward Part 5:  Big drops for Ronaldo and Fernandes Part 6:  Wolves wing-backs can be budget favourites Part 8:  Guimaraes can be a budget gem Part 9:  Son costs more than Kane, Perisic a defender Part 10:  Vardy drops in cost, Maddison rises \n",

        "summary": "Adrian Clarke speaks to Leicester's Chris Davies about the secrets of helping a first-team manager",
        "text": "\n The Premier League has a vision to develop a world-leading coaching development system by elevating the quality of coaching across the English system through its  Elite Coaching Plan .   \n As part of this, we are showcasing in a series of articles how the Premier League is leading a positive change in the global perception of our coaching at academy and first-team levels, as well as increasing the diversity of the coaching workforce. This includes interviews with some of the talented coaches coming up the ranks at Premier League clubs.  \n Earlier this year, Adrian Clarke, spoke to Leicester City's Chris Davies, one of the most highly respected and successful young coaches in English football. \n Chris Davies (LEI) \n In 12 years working alongside  Brendan Rodgers , first as a member of the backroom staff at Swansea City and  Liverpool , before becoming his assistant at Celtic and  Leicester City , the former Reading youth team player has played a part in several notable achievements. \n Still only 37, Davies' CV includes a promotion from the Championship, a role in one of the most exciting Premier League title races this century, back-to-back domestic trebles in Scotland and the masterminding of a first ever FA Cup Final triumph for Leicester. \n Taking time out of his busy schedule, Davies provides a wonderful insight into what it is like to be an assistant manager. \n Here, he breaks down his role and responsibilities, as well as telling us what he has learned as a No 2. \n Training ground dynamics \n \"I will lead the training day to day. That means I'll plan the sessions and manage the other coaches  Kolo Toure  and Adam Sadler on it, plus goalkeeping coach Mike Stowell. I'll then present my ideas to Brendan every morning. Normally it's, 'Good, happy with that,' and off we go,\" says Davies. \n \"Brendan will oversee and observe the training sessions. He will only intervene when he feels there is something he needs to say. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"Over the years he has gone from being really hands-on, taking pretty much every training session, to now trusting the staff more to deliver what he wants before picking his moments to come in. \n \"When it comes to the day before a match, things are different. Brendan will lead that session with the players. \n \"That's his game-planning day where the final details are laid out for the players. As the manager, he is rightly at the forefront of putting across those messages. It is something he has always done. \n Session plans \n \"As coaches we are all guided by the game model the manager puts in place. We know what sort of team we want to create, so there are specific details we are trying to cover each day. \n \"We've built up a huge database of session plans that are all bespoke to us, which is so useful. In the last few years, for logistical reasons, I've transferred from handwritten sessions to computer database sessions and it saves me hours! \n \"The challenge for myself and for all coaches is to make sure we are adding variety. You must stay open-minded to other types of sessions and learning from other content, so we can keep bringing new things to the table. \n \"If players have seen it all and your repertoire is used up, things can go stale. \n \"One thing Brendan and I have always done is engage with the existing staff, too. At Celtic, for example, we leant on John Kennedy, who is a brilliant coach, with some great ideas and sessions of his own. \n \"Sadler was already here at Leicester and he's great. I'll also go on courses and conferences as often as I can. \n \n \n \"\"If we are asking the players to perform and deliver at the very highest level then we, as a coaching staff, need to demand that of ourselves, and make sure we are at the very highest level too. You can't stand still.\"\" \n \n Chris Davies \n \n \n \n More than an assistant \n \"A big part of my job is to make sure Brendan only hears what is absolutely necessary or relevant. The assistant needs to be a buffer. \n \"Managers at this level can get saturated with information and too many tedious little things – and that's not what they need. If somebody has got an issue and I can deal with it, then I will always try to do that and encourage them to come to me first. \n \"To be fair to Brendan, he's got a huge energy for work and a real interest in every part of the club. He's always open to people knocking on his door, but an assistant's job is try and protect the manager. \n \"I want to help him make the big-money decisions with the clearest mind possible. \n Pre-match responsibilities \n \"I don't like it when an assistant goes around waving their arms and telling everyone what to do on a match day. Let the manager manage. By doing that, you give his words more weight and authority with the players. \n \"Before a game, I like to remind people of their jobs and reinforce the manager's current message, whatever that may be. \n \"I feel I'm pretty good at motivating the players, so I can be quite vocal and loud inside the dressing room. That said, sometimes you need to be softer and talk to them about calmness and having the confidence to get on the ball and play. \n \"It's our job to feel that emotional atmosphere inside the room. \n \"Personally, I also like to go around individually to embrace each player before they go out, to get a sense of what they need. \n \"Do they need that bit of edge from me? Or do they need someone to tell them it's all going to be alright? We must make sure the players are in the optimal place when they go out onto the pitch to do their jobs. \n In-game coaching \n \"During games I take a step back and focus on things from a strategic point of view. I don't like to get too involved emotionally in this decision, that decision. \n \"I've got a little thing I write on a notepad WIHH (What Is Happening Here). \n \"It's my way of coming out of the battle and looking at this from a purely tactical point of view. What is going on in this game? What does our team need? \n \"I'll advise on that throughout the game with Brendan and try to add some value. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"At half-time the four of us will sit around together and chat for five minutes, while the players are settling down, before Brendan delivers his message. \n \"In the second half, it's primarily about substitutions, that's the main way you can affect the game. I may talk to the physios to check in on the physical status of certain players during this period too. \n \"You are making judgment calls under pressure in grounds that have big atmospheres, so there isn't time for long-winded debates. \n \"When I talk to Brendan during the game, it has got to be snappy, to the point and have a good rationale.\" \n The value of experience in analysis \n \"All my experience was in youth coaching before taking a position as opposition analyst at Swansea when I was 25, and it was the best thing I could ever have done. \n \"In those five years [two at Swansea, three at Liverpool], my confidence grew enormously in terms of tactical awareness. \n \"To have real genuine knowledge meant I could go to a  Steven Gerrard , a  Jordan Henderson , any top player, with confidence, and talk to them about the game and be able to give them advice. \n \"I'm so pleased I did that job. There were times while I was doing it that I was wishing I was out there on the grass as a coach, but I wouldn't change it for the world. \n \"When I ended up at Reading as assistant manager, at the age of 30, I realised how valuable that job had been. Straightaway, I felt I could hold my own in conversations about tactics. My confidence soared and suddenly everything felt easy.\" \n Developing players \n \"I like to spend quality time analysing opponents and our own game. Those are the hard yards you need to put in, to deliver high-quality content and information back to the players. Analysing a match properly takes me three hours. \n \"Ever since my time at Liverpool, I've had individual player meetings and it's something I have continued since I became an assistant. \n \n \n \"\"I especially like working with midfielders because it was where I played, and it's probably the most complex position on the pitch in terms of the spaces around you.\" \n \n Chris Davies \n \n \n \n \"When I've got some clips to show them, I'll ask a player to come and meet me for a quick chat. It'll only usually be a 15-minute meet-up, where I pick out three things, max. \n \"Usually, I'd split my observations into two areas; decision-making and execution. Decision-making is tactics. Execution is technique. \n \"That development time, in the classroom if you like, is the most connection I have ever found with a player. \n \"By taking the time to go into detail about ways they can improve and feeding it back to them; that's a really strong relationship-builder between player and coach. \n \"They feel like you've gone the extra mile to help them and that's what players appreciate.\" \n Fine balance \n \"Because of the spotlight and exposure players are under, I am always very conscious about how I need to act and what I need to say, depending on whether the team is going well or not. \n \"Top-level players are under tremendous scrutiny these days. Every pass they make can be seen and discussed around the world, with people critiquing everything they have or haven't done, so having empathy with them is crucial. \n \"If it goes too far and you become a cheerleader 'not going to help them though. \n \"There's a fine balance that I've got better with, the more experience I have gained.\" \n Key ingredient \n \"If there is one quality you need to build from to be a good assistant manager, it is loyalty. Trust has to be base. \n \"Without it, the manager can never relax and know you've got his back. I pride myself on loyalty and trust above anything else. I'm here to support the manager every day, in whatever way I can. \n \n \n \"\"We are all part of the same team, the same club, we all want the same thing but there are internal dynamics at play so it's important that I protect Brendan. I also need to lead at the right times too.\" \n \n Chris Davies \n \n \n \n \"I don't see myself as an assistant in that sense. I see myself as a leader and I like to take on that role.\" \n Understanding your position \n \"You work very hard and dedicate yourself to the job, but it isn't actually your team and it's vital you remember that. \n \"As an assistant you have to be respectful of the boundaries and be aware it isn't your team. It belongs to the manager. They have all the pressure and responsibility. \n \"There's a bit of art to it, I guess. You need that huge work ethic and to embrace your key role in planning, but at the same time realise there are lines that can never be crossed. \n \"That is why the dynamic between manager and assistant is very complex.\" \n Future ambitions \n \"I don't think many people dream of being an assistant manager when they are older. Most want to coach their own team. \n \"When I first started working with Brendan, I did tell him that one day I would like to be a first-team manager. That was clear and it was a good starting point for us as a working relationship. \n \"That’s the path I still want to go down, to be a manager at the right time. \n \"Whilst I'm doing this job, though, and it is a wonderful job to have, I'll always be completely focused and loyal to Brendan, and to know my role.\" \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Betsy: Focus on being the best coach you can Part 2:  Why Arsenal lead the way for counter-attacking goals Part 3:  Hobbs: Support for coaches is incredibly important Part 5:  Binnion: Coaches must be authentic with their players Part 6:  Jackson: Building connection with players is key to coaching \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout assesses player prices in 2022/23  Fantasy Premier League  and their implications. \n Liverpool \n Managers will have to pay £13.0m to have  Mohamed Salah  in their opening squads this season. \n Liverpool’s Egyptian has risen £0.5m from last term, equalling his highest-ever starting cost set in 2018/19. \n Last season’s top-scoring player in Fantasy, Salah has produced 230+ points in each of his five campaigns on Merseyside. \n \n \n Our first set of  @OfficialFPL  prices for 2022/23 are in 👀  pic.twitter.com/CKzoU5AuYv \n— Liverpool FC (@LFC)  July 2, 2022 \n \n His potential for huge armband returns, combined with a favourable opening schedule, is likely to make Salah a big favourite from the start of the season. \n Liverpool face just one of last term’s top six in their first seven outings, visiting  Manchester United  in Gameweek 3. \n That kind run of opponents indicates a triple-up on Jurgen Klopp’s regulars can immediately reward managers, with a host of Reds players favourably priced. \n Liverpool's opening Gameweeks \n \n \n \n GW \n Opp \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n FUL (A) \n \n \n 2 \n CRY (H) \n \n \n 3 \n MUN (A) \n \n \n 4 \n BOU (H) \n \n \n 5 \n NEW (H) \n \n \n 6 \n EVE (A) \n \n \n 7 \n WOL (H) \n \n \n \n Luis Diaz  could prove outstanding value at just £8.0m, with the Colombian expected to secure the left-wing role following the departure of Sadio Mane.  \n Diogo Jota , meanwhile, has a new position in Fantasy this season. The Portuguese changes from a midfielder to a forward as he earned the vast majority of his minutes as a central striker in the previous campaign. \n Nonetheless, the arrival of  Darwin Nunez  means Jota will be a rotation risk.  \n The Uruguayan forward is identically priced to Jota at £9.0m. He produced 26 goals and four assists in 28 league appearances for Benfica last term.  \n Defensive double-up? \n At the back, Liverpool’s three top-scoring defenders from last season,  Trent Alexander-Arnold  (£7.5m),  Andrew Robertson  (£7.0m) and  Virgil van Dijk  (£6.5m), have remained the same prices. \n Alexander-Arnold placed third in the overall player standings on 208 points in 2021/22 and his many routes to returns will ensure he is the premium defender of choice for millions of managers. \n He combined two goals and 12 assists with 18 clean sheets and 32 bonus points. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Goalkeeper  Alisson  (£5.5m) could be a strong source of value between the posts for those considering a double-up on Liverpool's defence.  \n The Brazilian finished just seven points behind Van Dijk last season, yet costs £1.0m less than the centre-back in 2022/23. \n See:  All 2022/23 player price reveals \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Saka rises after career-best campaign Part 2:  Haaland cheaper than De Bruyne Part 3:  Brentford offer early value Part 5:  Big drops for Ronaldo and Fernandes Part 6:  Wolves wing-backs can be budget favourites Part 7:  Havertz now a forward, Bowen climbs in cost Part 8:  Guimaraes can be a budget gem Part 9:  Son costs more than Kane, Perisic a defender Part 10:  Vardy drops in cost, Maddison rises \n",

The header! The limbs!  pic.twitter.com/Bu9w8RIe3y \n— Leeds United (@LUFC)  May 15, 2022 \n \n Gelhardt is blessed with great natural ability and is never afraid to take defenders on. Indeed he completed more successful dribbles per 90 minutes than anyone else in the Leeds side, including the highly prized  Raphinha . \n Leeds most completed dribbles 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Completed dribbles/90 \n \n \n \n \n Joe Gelhardt \n 2.07 \n \n \n Raphinha \n 1.91 \n \n \n Jack Harrison \n 1.84 \n \n \n \n Min 500 mins played \n Gelhardt scored his first Premier League goal in a thrilling  3-2 defeat at Chelsea  last December, making a sharp run to get goal-side of  Thiago Silva , before converting a low  Tyler Roberts  cross from close range. \n His other top-flight strike was also a poacher’s finish, and another crucial late contribution. \n In the 93rd minute of a \"relegation six-pointer\" against Norwich City,  Gelhardt slotted home the winner  from four yards out after great work from Raphinha. \n Watch Gelhardt's winner against Norwich \n \n \n 🤩 \"Gelhardt is the hero!\"  pic.twitter.com/wh1RT4tjuu \n— Leeds United (@LUFC)  March 13, 2022 \n \n The youngster possesses a terrific left foot and is usually very accurate with it. \n He hit the target with 10 of his 15 shots last season and boasts the joint-best shooting accuracy percentage of anyone in Marsch's squad. \n Leeds shooting accuracy 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Shooting accuracy % \n \n \n \n \n Joe Gelhardt \n 66.7 \n \n \n Mateusz Klich \n 66.7 \n \n \n Jack Harrison \n 62.9 \n \n \n Rodrigo \n 52.9 \n \n \n Tyler Roberts \n 52.0 \n \n \n \n The big test now is for Gelhardt to shake off the \"super-sub\" tag and establish himself as a regular starter at Elland Road. \n Patrick Bamford 's return from injury will make that task more difficult, but we could also see both front men play together on occasions. \n Gelhardt has the ability to occupy a wide-forward role or play in that key role behind a main striker. \n As pre-season gets under way it will be important for the former Wigan Athletic striker to continue to impress Leeds' coaching staff and force himself further into Marsch's first-team thinking. \n He has proven himself as an effective second-half impact player, but his talent suggests he can offer much more than that. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Michael Olise (CRY) Part 2:  Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (LEI) Part 4:  Trevoh Chalobah (CHE) \n",

A. GAME. @Chukwuemekaa10  and  @AaronRamseyx  score as England win  #U19EURO , with Tim Iroegbunam also playing his part. Congratulations, boys! 🟣  https://t.co/vUSZjjAyFR \n— Aston Villa (@AVFCOfficial)  July 1, 2022 \n \n Twenty players in the England squad have come through Premier League academies and Foster praised the clubs' role in his team's development.  \n \"We’ve very blessed as a nation with our academies,\" Foster said. \"When they come into the England pathway they are technically outstanding. \n \"We don’t just look for good footballers, we look for good people as well, and they are outstanding.\"  \n The U19s' success follows other triumphs from past England youth sides. \n In 2017, the U20s secured the FIFA World Cup beating Venezuela, and later that year the U17s won their version, beating Spain 5-2, with Man City star  Phil Foden  scoring twice on that occasion.  \n This year's U19s replicated the class of 2017 in winning the Euros. \n \"Congratulations to England’s under-19s on their European Championship title,\" Premier League Chief Football Officer Tony Scholes said. \n \"It is incredibly exciting to see our young players performing on the international stage and credit must go to Ian Foster, his coaching team and The Football Association. \n \"We are proud to see many of the talented prospects from our clubs succeeding at the highest level and collecting another major trophy for England’s youth teams.\" \n England Under-19 squad  \n Goalkeepers:  Matthew Cox (Brentford), Harvey Davies (Liverpool), Teddy Sharman-Lowe (Chelsea)  Defenders:  Luke Chambers (Liverpool), Callum Doyle (Manchester City), Ronnie Edwards (Peterborough), Bashir Humphreys (Chelsea), Brooke Norton-Cuffy (Arsenal), Daniel Oyegoke (Brentford), Jarell Quansah (Liverpool)  Midfielders:  Carney Chukwuemeka (Aston Villa), Alfie Devine (Spurs), Jamie Bynoe-Gittens (Borussia Dortmund), Sam Iling-Junior (Juventus), Tim Iroegbunam (Aston Villa), Aaron Ramsey (Aston Villa), Alex Scott (Bristol City), Harvey Vale (Chelsea)  Forwards:  Liam Delap (Man City), Daniel Jebbison (Sheff Utd), Dane Scarlett (Spurs) \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout assesses player prices in 2022/23  Fantasy Premier League  and their implications. \n Brentford ’s  David Raya  has the potential to become the go-to budget goalkeeper in many Fantasy managers’ opening squads this season.  \n The Bees’ No 1 is available at £4.5m after totalling just 95 points in the previous campaign. \n However, Raya was limited to only 24 appearances due to injury in 2021/22. \n Indeed, his average of 4.0 points per match (ppm) was bettered by only three other regular starters in goal. \n \n \n 🐝 𝙋𝙧𝙞𝙘𝙚 𝙍𝙚𝙫𝙚𝙖𝙡 🐝 Which Bees do you have your eyes on? 👀 #BrentfordFC  |  #FPL  |  @OfficialFPL   pic.twitter.com/P81oDdYJtJ \n— Brentford FC (@BrentfordFC)  July 1, 2022 \n \n Ivan Toney ’s price tag of £7.0m could also attract attention thanks to a kind run of opponents.  \n Thomas Frank’s side face only one of last season’s top seven in the opening seven Gameweeks.  \n Toney scored eight of his 12 goals in 2021/22 in the final 19 Gameweeks, ranking third among forwards.  \n His 44 shots in the box also placed third in his position from Gameweek 20 onwards, while his 24 key passes were the second-most in his position. \n Value in Brighton backline \n Brighton & Hove Albion ’s defence could also provide managers with great value early on. \n Marc Cucurella  (£5.0m) is the Seagulls’ most expensive pick at the back due to his multiple routes to returns.  \n The wing-back combined a goal and an assist with 11 clean sheets and 21 bonus over his 35 appearances last term. \n \n \n Some key  @OfficialFPL  price reveals. 👀  pic.twitter.com/Hu0PIan43Y \n— Brighton & Hove Albion (@OfficialBHAFC)  July 1, 2022 \n \n He totalled 126 points, at least 31 more than any defensive team-mate. \n Centre-back  Lewis Dunk  and goalkeeper  Robert Sanchez  provide even cheaper options at just £4.5m apiece. \n Brighton face just one of last season's top-six sides in their first eight matches, away to  Manchester United  in Gameweek 1. \n Don't sleep on Kristensen \n Finally,  Leeds United ’s new right-back  Rasmus Kristensen  comes in at £5.0m on the back of an outstanding campaign for Red Bull Salzburg. \n The Dane scored 10 goals and supplied eight assists in 44 appearances across all competitions for the Austrian side in 2021/22. \n Elsewhere, forward  Patrick Bamford  will cost managers £7.5m. \n \n \n 🔥  @OfficialFPL  have announced their first batch of price reveals!  pic.twitter.com/0x5e5wQGM2 \n— Leeds United (@LUFC)  July 1, 2022 \n \n Bamford drops £0.5m from last term’s starting price after managing only two goals and two assists in an injury-hit 2021/22. \n If he can rediscover the form that helped him produce 17 goals and 11 assists in 2020/21, the 28-year-old has the schedule to quickly become a popular pick. \n Leeds face only one of last season’s top eight in their opening seven matches. \n See:  All 2022/23 player price reveals \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Saka rises after career-best campaign Part 2:  Haaland cheaper than De Bruyne Part 4:  Salah rises in price, Jota now a forward   Part 5:  Big drops for Ronaldo and Fernandes   Part 6:  Wolves wing-backs can be budget favourites Part 7:  Havertz now a forward, Bowen climbs in cost Part 8:  Guimaraes can be a budget gem Part 9:  Son costs more than Kane, Perisic a defender Part 10:  Vardy drops in cost, Maddison rises \n",

        "summary": "Adrian Clarke speaks with boyhood Leeds fan now first-team coach on his role and future ambitions",
        "text": "\n The Premier League has a vision to develop a world-leading coaching development system by elevating the quality of coaching across the English system through its  Elite Coaching Plan .   \n As part of this, we are showcasing in a series of articles, how the Premier League is leading a positive change in the global perception of our coaching at academy and first-team levels, as well as increasing the diversity of the coaching workforce.  \n Adrian Clarke spoke earlier this year to  Leeds United  first-team coach Mark Jackson who kindly set time aside to speak less than 48 hours after they dramatically secured their Premier League status with a  2-1 victory at Brentford  on the final day. \n Mark Jackson (LEE) \n “From the moment  Jesse Marsch  was brought into the club, so much changed so quickly for everyone,\" Jackson says. \n “Coming away from  Marcelo Bielsa ’s unique system of play built around man-marking, at a time when we were fighting a relegation battle, required a huge amount of adaptation from the players and staff. \n “We didn’t have a lot of time. There was a need to hit the ground running. \n \"And the way Jesse works on the training ground, was also completely different to how it had been, but together we worked really, really, hard to help the players understand this major transition as quickly as possible. \n “There was pressure, and it was challenging, but thankfully the hard work paid off.” \n The 44-year-old is a former academy graduate, with 19 first-team appearances for Leeds. Born in the city, and a boyhood fan to boot, he was thrilled to return to Elland Road six-and-a-half years ago in a coaching capacity. \n Initially brought in by Paul Hart to work with the Under-15s, he has since coached the Under-16s, Under-18s and more recently Leeds’ Premier League 2 side. \n First-team promotion \n This upward trajectory went to the next level in March, when Marsch joined from RB Leipzig to replace Bielsa. \n Keen to draw on Jackson’s knowledge of the club and their young players, the American promoted him to become part of his first-team coaching staff alongside Franz Schiemer and Cameron Toshack. \n “I was grateful for the opportunity to help and support them during that really important transition period,” Jackson added. \n “Moving from a head coach position with the Under-23s does mean I am in more of a supporting role now, but I comfortable with that. I feel I am ready to work with senior players and this is a great opportunity that I am enjoying. \n “The way training looks has totally changed. “Marcelo wanted to coach with drill practices a lot of the time, whereas Jesse is more traditional and aligned with the way I was brought up as a coach. \n \n \n \"I love Leeds United, and it’s a club with massive potential. All I can say is that I am very happy working with Jesse, playing a style of football that I like\" \n \n Mark Jackson \n \n \n \n “His sessions are not too far removed from what I experienced in my own playing career. \n “Everything is more game-based, with possession practices replacing drill-based work, for example. This has helped me really because it’s what I was attuned to before and it is how I see football being coached.” \n Session planning \n During Bielsa’s four-year spell in charge, the Argentinian liked the Under-23 group to join first-team training. \n While this gave the youngsters a fantastic opportunity to catch the manager’s eye, it did leave Jackson, who assisted those sessions, short on time to make specific tactical preparations for Premier League 2 matches. \n One key difference since the regime changed hands is an increase in joined-up thinking between members of the coaching staff, reveals Jackson. \n “Session planning was extremely challenging under the previous manager, as decisions were often made at the last minute. \n \"I might not know what we were going to focus on before we went out to train, and sometimes we’d be 10 minutes into the warm-up, and I still couldn’t be sure what the session was going to entail. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Marsch has had a huge effect at the club, both in terms of results on the pitch and his support to the coaches on the training pitch\n             \n \n “Now, we sit down the day before as a team of coaches - in a meeting that Jesse will lead - and together we discuss what we want to achieve from that next session. \n “My role on the grass is flexible from day to day. At times I might break off with one of the other coaches to work on an element of our play from a defensive point of view. \n “It might be that myself or Cameron [Toshack] take the scout team for an 11v11 against the starting XI. There it will be my responsibility to replicate how our next opposition play and assign roles to the players in that scout team. \n “The great thing for me is that we have this planning process now. And in that process, Jesse doesn’t dictate to us. \n “He will ask for opinions on what we should be doing, and how we do it. It’s been such a valuable experience so far, and I feel it’s a great quality for a manager to have that sense of inclusivity.” \n Experiences to treasure  \n During a pulsating run-in, Leeds were involved in several dramatic matches where they grabbed valuable late goals. \n They scored stoppage-time winners against  Norwich City ,  Wolverhampton Wanderers  and Brentford and  Pascal Struijk ’s last-minute equaliser in their  penultimate match at home to Brighton & Hove Albion , was also priceless. \n Being part of those astonishing twists and turns provided Jackson with experiences he will treasure. \n “I see Leeds United as my club, it is where I grew up, so to be part of those moments, so close to it, was really special. \n “After the euphoria and jubilation of  Joe Gelhardt ’s winner against Norwich, I remember saying to Jesse in the dressing-room that, believe it or not, this is quite normal for Leeds, and funnily enough that’s how it panned out in the closing weeks. \n Matchday preparations \n “Jesse always makes the final decisions, but throughout a game, he will turn around and ask for opinions. If I have an idea or a view on something tactical, or a possible change, he is the kind of manager that welcomes you bringing that forward. \n \n \n \"“Our use of video clips at half-time is something that I hadn’t seen before, and I have to say it can be an incredibly effective tool\" \n \n Mark Jackson \n \n \n \n \"Frank [Schiemer] is in constant dialogue with the analysts about which clips we want to show, and he will nip off a few minutes early to get them ready for the interval. \n \"And while the players are settling down, Jesse and the rest of us will review the clips before he presents them. \n “In the past managers have told players they think they can do this or that better, but the players had to take their word for it. \n \"Now, we can actually show players on a screen what they are doing well, areas to improve, and how we can exploit the opposition. It is really, really beneficial.” \n Appreciation for Bielsa \n The sudden departure of Bielsa stunned Leeds fans, who continue to revere the 60-year-old for the quality of football his sides delivered. \n Jackson is keen to point out how much he also values the experience of working alongside a manager with such a distinctive outlook. \n “Marcelo and the rest of his staff were great with me when I was the Under-23s head coach. They shared their ideas and were always open to answering any questions I had. \n “It was a unique style of football, so I had to spend a lot of time observing them, analysing their drills, and being around the group. \n \"I had to learn exactly what was required for me to transmit that philosophy to the Under-23s. It was an education.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One of the primary quirks of Bielsa’s ideas is based around choosing a formation dictated to by how the opposition line up. \n If, for example, an opponent play with one striker, it would usually mean a back four for Leeds. This would revert to a three-man defence when facing two strikers. \n “Alongside our excellent analysts we had to do a lot of scouting beforehand, studying how other Under-23 teams set up. That research was thorough and a real team effort” explains Jackson. \n “As soon as the team sheet came in we’d have a good idea of the formation we’d be up against, so then we would adjust our own shape accordingly. \n “To operate in this way the players knew we had to have two or three systems in mind, ready to go. \n “I had to coach my players so that they could easily deal with adaptability. This meant setting them up with a variety of ideas so that when an opponent altered their shape, we were able to react quickly within the game. \n “It was something we got to grips with and looking back we were fairly successful with it, too. \n “The funny thing is I am convinced certain managers I came up against tried to deliberately disrupt us, by throwing in a new formation unexpectedly,” he adds with a smile. \n “We were used to it, but the main challenge for me was knowing whether to drop a defensive midfielder into the back three, or sliding one of the full-backs inside. Or flipping that around the other way. \n “This was a challenging way to manage because we also had to make a lot of enforced substitutions in order to adjust. \n \"That said, the experience taught me to take certain considerations into every match you play and to investigate each eventuality beforehand so that you are ready to react.” \n Valuable experiences \n At the back end of a playing career where the former defender represented Scunthorpe United, Kidderminster Harriers and Rochdale, Jackson went through his coaching badges as a semi-pro with non-league Farsley. \n \n \n \"I have coached at every level, among all the age groups, with differing abilities and I firmly believe that has helped me massively in my own career\" \n \n Mark Jackson \n \n \n \n He worked as head of football at Leeds City College, coached at Bradford City for a short period, while also working in local primary schools, before Leeds came knocking. \n According to Jackson, each of those early roles were tremendously valuable to his learning. \n “Someone asked me a while back for advice on how to succeed in coaching and my best advice was to give yourself a vast array of experiences,” he says. \n “I have coached at every level, among all the age groups, with differing abilities and I firmly believe that has helped me massively in my own career. \n “The one constant that you need to have, no matter which level you are coaching at is adaptability in my opinion. Being able to adjust to any given situation or circumstance helps you deal with problems when they present themselves. \n “If you can think on your feet and put something in place to fix a situation quickly, that is half the battle. \n “The other piece of advice I would always pass on is, to connect with your players. \n “I remember being on a course once where all the coaches were discussing their philosophies, systems, tactics etc, but I look at it a different way. \n “I told them my philosophy is based around connecting with players. If you can’t get them on board or understand how to treat every individual, it can be an uphill battle. Building a rapport is vital.” \n Future ambitions \n Looking into the future, Jackson harbours ambitions to manage at first-team level and to help facilitate that, he is hoping to enrol on a UEFA Pro License course as quickly as possible. \n In the short term though, he is hoping that Marsch decides to make him part of the first-team set-up for next season and beyond. \n “Since I came back to Elland Road the club have been so supportive to me and given me so many great opportunities to develop as a coach. The progression has felt natural until this point and I am hoping that continues. \n “The way I look at my own career is to simply hone my skills every day, because you never stop learning. \n “I love Leeds United, and it’s a club with massive potential. All I can say is that I am very happy working with Jesse, playing a style of football that I like. \n “If I can play a part in helping even more young players make it into the Leeds United first team, that’s what it’s all about.” \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Betsy: Focus on being the best coach you can Part 2:  Why Arsenal lead the way for counter-attacking goals Part 3:  Hobbs: Support for coaches is incredibly important Part 4:  Binnion: League helps take me out of my comfort zone as a coach \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout assesses player prices in 2022/23  Fantasy Premier League  and their implications. \n Man City \n It will cost Fantasy managers £11.5m to buy  Erling Haaland  at the start of the season. \n Manchester City ’s new forward arrives on the back of 49 goals and 13 assists in 52 appearances for Borussia Dortmund in the last two Bundesliga campaigns. \n \n \n The first wave of our 2022/23  #FPL  price list has been revealed! 🙌 Thoughts? 💬👇 \n— Manchester City (@ManCity)  July 1, 2022 \n \n And the champions’ early schedule indicates Haaland will be a hugely popular pick for opening squads. \n Man City are the only side to avoid all of last season’s top six in the first six Gameweeks.  \n Man City's opening Gameweeks \n \n \n \n GW \n Opp \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n WHU (A) \n \n \n 2 \n BOU (H) \n \n \n 3 \n NEW (A) \n \n \n 4 \n CRY (H) \n \n \n 5 \n NFO (H) \n \n \n 6 \n AVL (A)  \n \n \n \n Haaland offers a less expensive route into their attack than playmaker  Kevin De Bruyne , who again costs £12.0m. \n The Belgian averaged 7.6 points per start last term, a team-leading total. \n De Bruyne’s 87 chances created and 31 shots on target were also both more than any other player for Pep Guardiola’s side. \n Phil Foden , meanwhile, could provide a strong source of value during that run. The England star has been priced at £8.0m. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n In defence,  Joao Cancelo  will cost £7.0m, a rise of £1.0m from the start of the previous campaign. \n Despite that hike, he could still prove a bargain buy due to his many routes to returns.  \n The Portuguese combined one goal and 11 assists with 19 clean sheets and 27 bonus points in 2021/22.  \n Indeed, Cancelo was Man City’s top-scoring player in Fantasy last season, his total of 201 points placing fifth in the overall player standings. \n See:  All 2022/23 player price reveals \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Saka rises after career-best campaign Part 3:  Brentford offer early value Part 4:  Salah rises in price, Jota now a forward Part 5:  Big drops for Ronaldo and Fernandes Part 6:  Wolves wing-backs can be budget favourites Part 7:  Havertz now a forward, Bowen climbs in cost Part 8:  Guimaraes can be a budget gem Part 9:  Son costs more than Kane, Perisic a defender Part 10:  Vardy drops in cost, Maddison rises \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke highlights players who are set to build on a debut campaign full of promise and set alight the Premier League this season.  \n Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (LEI) \n Arguably the biggest success story of  Leicester City 's 2021/22 campaign was the emergence of the 23-year-old academy graduate. \n \n \n \n \n \n LEI \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 2 \n \n BRE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Dewsbury-Hall, who joined the club at the age of eight, had to be extremely patient to wait for a chance to establish himself in the Foxes' starting XI. \n But once he made the breakthrough last term, he instantly became a must-pick for  Brendan Rodgers . \n Making 28 Premier League appearances in central midfield and 44 across all competitions, Dewsbury-Hall was voted Leicester's Players' Player of the Year by his peers. \n Ahead of the new season he has penned a new five-year contract to stay at King Power Stadium, with many now tipping him to be a future club captain. \n Leicester passing stats 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Successful passes into final third \n Successful passes in opposition half \n \n \n \n \n Dewsbury-Hall \n 13.68 \n Tielemans \n 26.46 \n \n \n Tielemans \n 12.31 \n Dewsbury-Hall \n 24.33 \n \n \n Barnes \n 10.60 \n Mendy \n 22.65 \n \n \n Maddison \n 10.11 \n Pereira \n 18.96 \n \n \n Lookman \n 9.70 \n Justin \n 18.87 \n \n \n \n One of the facets of Dewsbury-Hall's game that brought added value to Leicester's play was his willingness to look up and pick out a forward pass. \n When it is on to do so the former Blackpool and Luton Town loanee does not hesitate to feed the ball into players who are ahead of him on the pitch. \n His confidence and technical ability enables the Foxes forwards to receive the ball earlier in those key advanced areas. \n Dewsbury-Hall goal v Palace \n \n \n Ready for more class from KDH in 2022/23 🌪 #KDH2027   pic.twitter.com/sucXpdNCq7 \n— Leicester City (@LCFC)  June 25, 2022 \n \n Rodgers deployed Dewsbury-Hall as an orthodox box-to-box central midfielder, as a defensive midfielder, and, towards the latter stages of last season, also as an attacking midfielder. \n That adaptability is a huge plus for the Leicester manager, who must have been impressed by Dewsbury-Hall's rounded qualities. \n Chances created and possession won \n \n \n \n Chances created in open play \n Possession won per 90 \n \n \n \n \n Dewsbury-Hall \n 1.45 \n Ndidi \n 9.17 \n \n \n Lookman \n 1.36 \n Evans \n 7.00 \n \n \n Maddison \n 1.31 \n Dewsbury-Hall \n 6.63 \n \n \n Barnes \n 1.24 \n Tielemans \n 6.43 \n \n \n Tielemans \n 1.16 \n Lookman \n 6.30 \n \n \n \n In a side containing high-class creative talents such as  James Maddison ,  Youri Tielemans  and  Harvey Barnes , it was Dewsbury-Hall who came up with the most key passes per 90 minutes in open play. \n Adept at feeding the right type of passes into attackers, the former youth-team star is excellent inside the final third. \n To further highlight his broad range, Dewsbury-Hall also regains possession 6.63 times per 90 minutes, a tally bettered by only  Wilfred Ndidi  and  Jonny Evans  for the Foxes. \n Leicester running stats 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Distance/90 \n \n \n \n \n Dewsbury-Hall \n 11.90 \n \n \n Mendy \n 11.80 \n \n \n Justin \n 11.30 \n \n \n Albrighton \n 11.20 \n \n \n Tielemans \n 11.10 \n \n \n Castagne \n 10.90 \n \n \n \n This breakthrough talent is also incredibly hardworking, which fits well with Rodgers' high-tempo philosophy. \n Averaging almost 12km per match, he gets around the pitch very effectively. \n Until last season we had not seen much of Dewsbury-Hall but it would be a huge surprise if he is not a fixture in Leicester's first-choice XI again this season. \n If his progress continues, he could develop into one of the best all-round midfielders in the division. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Michael Olise (CRY) Part 3:  Joe Gelhardt (LEE) Part 4:  Trevoh Chalobah (CHE) \n",

        "text": "\n The Premier League has a vision to develop a world-leading coaching development system by elevating the quality of coaching across the English system through its  Elite Coaching Plan .   \n As part of this, we are showcasing in a series of articles, how the Premier League is leading a positive change in the global perception of our coaching at academy and first-team levels, as well as increasing the diversity of the coaching workforce.  \n One way the Premier League is leading the change is through its  Elite Heads of Coaching  (EHOC) programme, which seeks to empower all Premier League and EFL clubs to establish a sustainable approach to coach development in academy football. \n Earlier this year, Adrian Clarke spoke to Travis Binnion,  Manchester United ’s Under-18 lead coach, a role he also combines with being Head of Player Development & Coaching, who is currently on the Premier League’s  Elite Coach Accreditation Scheme (ECAS) . \n Travis Binnion (MUN) \n \"The most challenging part of my job is getting players to just worry about themselves and their progress. \n \"Are you better than yesterday? Are you better than you were six weeks ago? If you are that's great, what's happened? If not, why not? Let's work on it. \n \"There is so much going on in a teenager's life and so many voices they can listen to - and we must not to let it interfere with their development. \n 'We need joined-up thinking' \n \"If we as coaches think we are the biggest and sole influences then we are kidding ourselves. So, to get these young players to be the best they can be, we need joined-up thinking and for all the various stakeholders to be on the same page. \n \"That means getting parents, friends, agents etc to buy in and understand the role they can play, to help that person achieve their potential. \n \"This is an environment and culture thing, and it's something we are working hard to create.\" \n Straight-talking and incredibly passionate about improving the gifted young players in his care, Binnion speaks with clarity and is driven to make a difference. \n Starting out \n After a hip injury ended his own dreams of becoming a first-team player at boyhood club Sheffield United, Binnion embarked on a coaching career within the Blades Academy at the age of 21. \n Taken under his wing by John Pemberton, he was assistant manager of a Sheff Utd Under-18s side featuring  Harry Maguire  that reached the 2011 FA Youth Cup Final. \n When Nick Cox left as Academy manager at Bramall Lane five years later to join Man Utd, Binnion was handed the reins, aged just 31. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"I learned a lot about communicating with people and trying to inspire as Academy manager at Sheffield United,\" he says. \"I picked up a lot of new skills doing that job which was fantastic, but it did dilute my time on the grass working with players. \n \"I did alright but trying to run and develop the academy, manage all the staff and work on the organisational side, all while still coaching the Under-23s, wasn't easy at the time.\" \n In 2019, Cox brought Binnion across to Man Utd to oversee the U14-U16 player development phase. Last summer, after a reshuffle at Carrington, he became lead coach of the Under-18s. \n Could that dual role be beneficial to the players? Binnion thinks so. \"Nick Cox's vision is working really well,\" he says. \n \"In academies I feel like there can be a lot of issues that crop up across phase lines - and that's the opposite of what is meant to be achieved. \n \n \n \"This is an environment and culture thing, and it’s something we are working hard to create\" \n \n Travis Binnion \n \n \n \n \"From foundations into 14s, 16s, into the youth team, even youth team to the 23s, you've got different people with differing opinions, a player's development can be stifled or accelerated. That's not always in the player's favour.\" \n \"Alignment is a word that is used a lot, but it is so key. The way we work at United reduces issues that can arise when there is a lack of continuity. \n \"Here I like to get our 14s, 15s and 16s coaches involved in some youth-team sessions and senior staff from the older age groups like Mark Dempsey and Paul McShane will get involved with the younger guys too. \n \"We have got a real swirl going on and it gives me the ability to make sure the programme is right for the players, that we are giving them the right experiences, and crucially, that we are all making the right decisions. \n \"We have the benefit of knowing what comes next for them, and that's the beauty of it.\" \n All-round preparation  \n Preparing teenage footballers for the rigours of life in the professional game is very much at the forefront of Binnion's thinking. \n The technical, tactical, and athletic aspects of their development are naturally of paramount importance, but so too is their mindset. \n \"They grow up in a bubble, training and playing through the age groups, but down the line it is the best game in the world, that is also a ruthless industry,\" he says. \n \"They have got to know what is going to be required of them and you can't just shock them at the point when it happens. You need to build them up to it. \n \"That means the work ethic in training, the standards of behaviour around the building have to be right. \n \"It's important young players don't think they can just do their bit on the football pitch and then do what they want in the gym, in school or wherever else they are. \n \"You are trying to build a robust individual who's aware of their surroundings, who thrives as a person on and off the pitch. \n \"My view is players should only fail if they are not good enough, not because they weren't able to adjust. \n \"If we get that side of it right, with the quality of players we have at Man Utd, then we will succeed as an academy, and most importantly the kids will also go on and achieve.\" \n Elite Coach Apprenticeship Scheme \n In 2021, Binnion was offered a place on the Premier League's Elite Coach Apprenticeship Scheme (ECAS). \n It is a two-year development programme aimed at accelerating the learning of coaches employed by clubs, who demonstrate the potential to be future elite coaches in youth football. \n Encouraged by Man Utd to enrol in the scheme, the experience is proving beneficial to Binnion. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"I feel like I have been on a hamster wheel for 14 or 15 years. It's worked for me, and I just love coaching players and helping them. \n \"That's what gets me excited, but sometimes you need to step out of your day-to-day working environment to develop other skillsets. \n \"Even just taking the time to reflect on what you are, or what you aren't is invaluable.\" \n Along with other selected coaches from around the country, he recently spent two days at Birmingham University learning communication and relationship-building skills, that included a talk from hostage situation specialists. \n There was also an ad-lib session at a comedy club, designed to help the coaches work on reacting to impromptu situations, particularly on the media side. \n \"I want to upskill and stretch myself, and ECAS does that. It takes you out of your comfort zone at times and that's good. \n \"Technically and tactically you have to be spot-on, and for a coach at this level, I see that as a given. \n \"However, that connection with people, whether it is your seniors, the first-team staff, a parent, an agent a player; you will live or die on those relationships and conversations. \n \"At ECAS when they give you the theory behind it all and the underpinning knowledge, it is awakening. It gives you clarity on some of the things that have happened in the past.\" \n Academy tradition \n In December 2019, Man Utd proudly celebrated the 4,000th consecutive fixture that contained at least one Academy graduate in the matchday squad, a run that is still ongoing. \n Marcus Rashford ,  Jesse Lingard ,  Paul Pogba ,  Scott McTominay ,  Anthony Elanga  and  Dean Henderson  are currently flying the flag for an academy that has developed a stream of outstanding players down the years. \n Handed the responsibility to guide and nurture the next generation of talent, Binnion is excited at what the future holds. \n \"Just look at the number of players who have had careers, who came through at United, it is second to none. \n \"Continuing that success and developing it even further is a passion of mine, and a passion of the staff together. We want to be regarded as the best developers of players in this country and in Europe. \n \"At our place there is something more powerful than anything that can be said, and that is the photos hanging up of all the top players we have produced down the years. Maintaining that tradition is essential.\" \n Be authentic  \n Before we wrap our conversation, Binnion is asked two more questions. \n What has he learned most from his coaching experiences so far? And what gives him the biggest buzz? \n \"I have learned that if you truly care about every person or player that is in your care, you always have to be authentic with them.\" \n \"Care and authenticity mean you will mess up less. If you are being you, to the best of your ability, at that point to help the group of players or staff that you are with, and you get it wrong - you have got it wrong for the right reasons. \n \n \n \"For the wider industry and developers it’s about seeing players have long and successful careers in the game, and beyond football\" \n \n Travis Binnion \n \n \n \n \"That's when you can reflect and improve on it. \n \"As for the bits that make you feel best; while it is nice to play lovely football and win matches – those moments are only great for the players and staff involved. \n \"For the wider industry and developers it's about seeing players have long and successful careers in the game, and beyond football. \n \"Seeing kids you work with go on to the next level and shine, that's what provides me with the biggest buzz and the most satisfaction. \n \"That's why we do the job, isn't it?\" \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Academy coaches broaden horizons with comedy Part 2:  Hobbs: To help players we must help coaches Part 3:  Elite coach programme opening minds and doors Part 5:  Building connection with players is key to coaching \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout looks at the  Fantasy Premier League  potential of the summer signings ahead of the 2022/23 season. \n Richarlison (TOT) £8.5m \n The signing of Richarlison could have an impact on Harry Kane and Son Heung-min’s playing time for  Tottenham Hotspur  in 2022/23. \n The versatile Brazilian produced 43 goals and 20 assists in Fantasy over the past four seasons for  Everton . \n He provides head coach Antonio Conte with an option as a centre-forward or on the left of Spurs’ front three. \n \n \n It's official 🔥  #WelcomeRicharlison   pic.twitter.com/pC6IOv2kLp \n— Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial)  July 1, 2022 \n \n Conte was heavily reliant on both Kane and Son after taking charge in Gameweek 11 last season, starting both players in every match they were available for.  \n Indeed, from Conte's arrival onwards only two outfield players,  Southampton ’s James Ward-Prowse and Watford midfielder Moussa Sissoko, played more minutes than Kane. \n Despite his extended pitch time, Kane struggled for output in the latter stages of matches. \n The England star scored only one of his 17 goals last season after the 60-minute mark. \n Threat to star duo's minutes? \n This season, a change to the substitute rules gives Premier League managers more opportunities to alter their sides during matches.  \n They can now replace five of their starting XI, compared with a previous total of three.  \n Kane and Son will undoubtedly remain vital figures for Spurs in 2022/23. \n But initially, at least, Richarlison could prove a very handy option off the bench.  \n Conte could utilise the Brazilian's explosive pace in the latter stages of tightly contested matches or bring him on for Kane or Son if Spurs hold a comfortable advantage. \n See:  The Scout's FPL new signings \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout looks at clubs who can be paired together effectively to help  Fantasy Premier League  managers make a strong start in 2022/23. \n Arsenal and Newcastle  \n Arsenal  boasted one of the most reliable defences in Fantasy in the previous campaign. They kept 13 clean sheets, a total bettered by only four other sides. \n Six of those shutouts were recorded at home, and a further seven on the road, highlighting the Gunners' consistency. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Newcastle United  improved significantly at the back after the arrival of Eddie Howe as head coach in Gameweek 12. \n The Magpies claimed all eight of their shutouts last season from that point, a total bettered by only five other sides. \n Arsenal and Newcastle combine to offer a very favourable extended run of fixtures from the start of 2022/23. \n By selecting the side with the better fixture each Gameweek, managers can avoid all of last season’s top 10 in the opening 12 rounds of matches. \n How to rotate from the start \n \n \n \n GW \n Team \n Opp \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n NEW \n NFO (H) \n \n \n 2 \n NEW \n BHA (A) \n \n \n 3 \n ARS \n BOU (A) \n \n \n 4 \n ARS \n FUL (H) \n \n \n 5 \n ARS \n AVL (H) \n \n \n 6 \n NEW \n CRY (H) \n \n \n 7 \n ARS \n EVE (H) \n \n \n 8 \n NEW \n BOU (H) \n \n \n 9 \n NEW \n FUL (A) \n \n \n 10 \n NEW \n BRE (H) \n \n \n 11 \n ARS \n LEE (A) \n \n \n 12 \n NEW \n EVE (H) \n \n \n \n Goalkeepers Aaron Ramsdale and Nick Pope are likely to be too expensive to consider as a rotation pairing. Both are expected to cost more than £4.5m in 2022/23 Fantasy. \n Managers could instead be best served by using centre-backs Benjamin White and Dan Burn. \n White could be priced cheaper than his defensive team-mates at Arsenal Gabriel and Kieran Tierney. \n The Englishman has claimed 100+ points in each of the last two seasons in Fantasy, despite failing to score or assist. \n For his part, Burn has two goals and an assist during that period, suggesting he will be less expensive than the rest of the Newcastle backline. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  How to guarantee home matches for your picks Part 2:  Pair up Leeds and Brentford for great early fixtures Part 3:  Cucurella and Justin can combine for returns Part 4:  Mings and Zemura a value pairing   Part 5:  Guehi and Jonny can reward early investment \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke highlights players who are set to build on a debut campaign full of promise to set alight the Premier League this season.  \n Michael Olise (CRY) \n Crystal Palace  should feel optimistic Michael Olise will make significant progress in his second full season as a Premier League player. \n \n \n \n \n \n CRY \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 2 \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n The talented 20-year-old, who joined from Reading in the summer of 2021, made a positive impression during what was an injury-disrupted debut campaign at Selhurst Park. \n Olise only featured for 1,138 minutes, exactly one third of the season, but during his time on the pitch he displayed high levels of technical ability. \n A forward's delight \n Cutting in from the right to deliver a stream of teasing crosses, Olise's quality shone when he was fit and available to perform for  Patrick Vieira 's side. \n He plays with his head up and this provides him with the vision to see where team-mates are inside the penalty area. \n Using his wonderful left foot to great effect, he delivered two Premier League goals and five assists last term. This averaged out at 0.4 assists per 90 minutes, which placed Olise fifth in the top-flight rankings. \n Average assists 21/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Return per 90 \n \n \n \n \n Kulusevski \n 0.57 \n \n \n Pogba \n 0.53 \n \n \n Barnes \n 0.43 \n \n \n Salah \n 0.42 \n \n \n Olise \n 0.40 \n \n \n \n Statistically, only one player registered a higher expected-assists (xA) figure than Olise in 2021/22:  Trent Alexander-Arnold . \n Remarkably, Olise was sandwiched between the  Liverpool  full-back and two of the division's leading lights,  Kevin De Bruyne  and  Mohamed Salah . \n When you consider the Hammersmith-born player endured a stop-start campaign and did not represent a side challenging at the top end of the table, his numbers are incredible. \n They are a testament to the quality of chances he consistently served up for his Palace team-mates. \n Expected assists 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n xA per 90 \n \n \n \n \n Alexander-Arnold \n 0.31 \n \n \n Olise \n 0.26 \n \n \n De Bruyne \n 0.25 \n \n \n Salah \n 0.24 \n \n \n \n Five of Olise's seven direct goal contributions arrived when he came off the bench, so one of his big challenges this season will be to nail down a consistent place in Vieira's starting XI. \n His ability suggests that is very much possible, with a berth on the right of Palace's forward line his likeliest spot. \n Olise's skills vs Wolves \n \n \n Michael Olise moves like it's a video game 🎮 #CPFC   pic.twitter.com/av6kHisirF \n— Crystal Palace F.C. (@CPFC)  March 6, 2022 \n \n Fitting in superbly with the Eagles' change in style under Vieira, Olise likes to travel with the ball at his feet as often as possible. \n He averaged 16 ball carries per 90 minutes last season and created 20 chances after carrying the ball. \n Highest threat for Palace 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Crosses* \n Player \n Chances* \n \n \n \n \n Olise \n 4.04 \n Olise \n 1.9 \n \n \n Ayew \n 3.29 \n Zaha \n 1.5 \n \n \n Mitchell \n 1.68 \n Edouard \n 1.21 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Player \n Dribbles* \n \n \n \n \n Zaha \n 2.44 \n \n \n Olise \n 2.22 \n \n \n Edouard \n 1.72 \n \n \n \n *Stats per match \n Palace are a fast, young outfit full of creative spark, and Olise is the man most likely to provide moments of imagination inside the final third. \n He is an exciting player to watch. \n To kick on to the next level in the coming season, the 20-year-old just needs to feature more consistently. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (LEI) Part 3:  Joe Gelhardt (LEE) Part 4:  Trevoh Chalobah (CHE) \n",

        "text": "\n The Premier League has a vision to develop a world-leading coaching development system by elevating the quality of coaching across the English system through its  Elite Coaching Plan . \n In a series of articles, we are showcasing how the Premier League is leading a positive change in the global perception of our coaching at academy and first-team levels, as well as increasing the diversity of the coaching workforce.  \n Elite Coach Accreditation Scheme \n The Premier League's  Elite Coach Accreditation Scheme (ECAS)  is a world-class development opportunity for high-potential coaches at Premier League and Category One Academies that looks to support the aim of the ECP. \n \"ECAS is a two-year development programme across over 2,400 learning hours,\" says Premier League Director of Coaching Marc Canham. \"They're exposed to business mentors, people from politics, people from arts, people from different sports. \n \"And we deliberately expose them to those diverse environments to try and challenge their thinking and look at new practices, and be innovative when they go back to their clubs and work with our young players.\" \n Canham was speaking at a recent ceremony to celebrate the ECAS graduation of 24 participating coaches at Ashridge Business School. \n Equality, diversity and inclusion ensured  \n With ECAS, equality, diversity and inclusion is ensured at every stage, from the identification of coaches to their development on the scheme.   \n \"I would highly recommend the schemes that the Premier League now have in place,\" says Manisha Tailor, assistant head of coaching at Queens Park Rangers. Taylor was one of 24 coaches who recently celebrated graduation from ECAS. \n \"Because I recognise the value and importance in ensuring that we have an inclusive landscape within the game and that these games provide an opportunity to allow that to happen,\" she adds. \n \"The value that these opportunities bring is not only networking, but a foot in the door for those people who had those aspirations of working within a professional football club.\" \n 'ECAS allows us to improve ourselves' \n Coaches on ECAS take part in a Coach Development Institute Programme [CDIP], which is individualised to each coach and combines workshops and study visits in football as well as in other sports and industries. \n \"ECAS supports people, particularly coaches like myself ... by allowing us to improve ourselves,\" says Kieran Lewis, an academy coach at Arsenal and another graduate. \n \"To better our understanding, to better our knowledge. Therefore, if we can better those abilities, each individual will hopefully improve the culture, the programme and the development of these players we're trying to facilitate into the Premier League.\" \n \n \n \"We see ECAS as absolutely fundamental to the long-term success of the academies and coaching in this country\" \n \n Marc Canham, Premier League Director of Coaching \n \n \n \n A valedictorian is celebrated every year for the person who achieved distinction in their award, which this year was Cardiff City's Tom Hutton. \n \"The Premier League have been huge to get us over the line,\" says Hutton. \"They show a lot of empathy and support to the situations they're in. \n \"The little lessons that you learn along the way and the people you meet are the biggest part of the experience for me, and with hard work and perseverance, you can definitely reap the rewards in your coaching performance from this course.\" \n Canham adds: \"We see programmes like [ECAS] as absolutely fundamental to the long-term success of the academies and coaching in this country, helping develop more and better home-grown players for the Premier League in the future, but also to support pathways for coaches themselves.\" \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Academy coaches broaden horizons with comedy Part 2:  Hobbs: To help players we must help coaches Part 4:  Binnion: League helps take me out of my comfort zone as a coach Part 5:  Building connection with players is key to coaching \n",

        "summary": "Arsenal's Head of Academy Coaching Luke Hobbs tells Adrian Clarke how Premier League supports coach development",
        "text": "\n The Premier League has a vision to develop a world-leading coaching development system by elevating the quality of coaching across the English system through its  Elite Coaching Plan .   \n As part of this, we are showcasing in a series of articles, how the Premier League is leading a positive change in the global perception of our coaching at academy and first-team levels, as well as increasing the diversity of the coaching workforce.  \n One way the Premier League is leading the change is through its  Elite Heads of Coaching  (EHOC) programme, which seeks to empower all Premier League and EFL clubs to establish a sustainable approach to coach development in academy football. \n Earlier this year, Adrian Clarke spoke to Luke Hobbs, the head of academy coaching at  Arsenal , who is a member of EHOC to hear about his role and how the Premier League helps him. \n Luke Hobbs (Arsenal) \n Player development will always be the No 1 priority at academy level, but to facilitate this, standards of coaching must never be allowed to stand still. So, who is it that coaches the coaches?  \n At Arsenal, that responsibility belongs to Hobbs, who oversees the Under-9s right up to the Under-23s, across their hugely successful sites at Hale End and London Colney. \n \"We need to help the coaches in order to help the players,\" says Hobbs as he passionately explains the value of being on hand to give them regular support. \n \"The volume of staff around the players is so big. There's operations, sports science and medicine, player care, analysis, education, talent ID, nutrition, and psychology – and the head coach at each age group manages all of those members of staff, as well as the players and their parents. \n \"The support that each coach needs, to be a good coach, to be a good people manager and to look after everything else is incredibly important. That's why we are there.\" \n Beneficial feedback \n As part of his remit, Hobbs rotates his time working with different age-group coaches. They will often be mic-ed up and filmed in training, as well as on certain matchdays. \n \"All the head coaches get match day and session feedback throughout the season,\" he adds. \"From my end it's usually a lot of what went well when we sit down with them. It can be so beneficial for a coach to take a step back, reflect, and watch how they get their messages across to the players. \n \"At Arsenal we also focus heavily on our playing style and trying to be aligned from Under-9s to Under-23s,\" continues Hobbs, who has worked within their Academy since 2013. \n \n \n \"The support that each coach needs, to be a good coach, to be a good people manager and to look after everything else is incredibly important. That’s why we are there.\" \n \n Luke Hobbs \n \n \n \n \"For example, we will look at what 'starting to create an attack' looks like at Under-9s. What it's like at Under-12s and so on. \n \"And I'll ask myself, 'How do we train it?' 'What does it look like in a game?' 'Which principles stay the same, or alter as the boys get older?' \n \"If my eye tells me that in our playing style I am seeing similar things throughout the Academy, that is in line with our playing identity, to me is a gauge of success. I'm not overly obsessed with results.\" \n To help retain that similar way of thinking, his Under-18s head coach, Under-23s and Loans Coach and Under-23s head coach all regularly go to Hale End to share ideas and knowledge with their fellow coaches. \n Staff there also pay frequent visits to London Colney, to learn from what is going on. This helps us to create one coaching team over two training grounds. \n Last summer, Mark Rivers, who had previously spent 10 years working at the FA, joined him in a role in which he manages Pre-Academy Coaching from the Under-5s to Under-8s.  \n Rivers is also on the Premier League's Future Coach Developer Pilot Programme with several other high-potential coach developers from across the game.   \n Core values \n Inspired by Arsenal Academy boss and former club captain  Per Mertesacker , the club's vision is to be the most caring and challenging football academy in the world. \n The aim is to produce \"strong young Gunners\" with three core values at the heart of what they do: discipline, humility and respect. \n \"In the age groups I cover I am big on those values,\" says Rivers. \"If we are preaching these messages to the coaches, to the players, to the parents and making sure they adhere to them, we have got to do the same. \n \"Part of my job is to make sure that by respectfully challenging the coaches. We too are living out these values. \n \"If we don't, they just become lovely phrases that go on mouse mats and mugs!\" \n Personal connection \n Rivers is also keen to point out that his role is not just to assess the work of the coaches, but to have a constant, open and friendly dialogue with them. \n \"We talk about having a coaching workforce full of radiators rather than hoovers,\" he adds. \n \"Radiators warm the place up. As soon as we get into that dome at Hale End it's all smiles and fist bumps. I think having that connector with a coach is key. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                At Arsenal, Mark Rivers wants a decision-rich environment where the coaches are able to make decisions for themselves\n             \n \n \"I hear you had this going on in your life, do you want to talk about it? How was your coaching course the other day? Do you want to share ideas? \n \"I'll ask about the session they did last week and see if they've had time to reflect. We don't want it to become a churn of session, session, game, session, session, game, without getting to know about each other as people too.\" \n As part of the EHOC programme, both men are given access to highly experienced mentors, and through courses put on by the Premier League, they are taught how to mentor too. \n Great value is also placed on soaking up knowledge from outside sources. \n Learning from others \n Hobbs, 42, may have worked at Arsenal's Academy alongside Liam Brady, Andries Jonker and now Mertesacker - as well having a spell in interim charge himself - but it his view that gaining expertise from elsewhere is of paramount importance. \n \"At a big club like this you can sometimes become a little bit insular, but it's indispensable to get advice and learn from what's going on outside the football club. \n \"This season we’ve had  Rio Ferdinand  speak to all our coaches for an hour, and we've also had [former West Ham academy director] Tony Carr come in and chat to us too. \n \"External speakers from a range of different backgrounds are invited in to add value, and very soon  David Seaman  is joining us to tell us what he learnt from all the brilliant managers he played under which should be fantastic.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Per Mertesacker wants Arsenal to be the most caring and challenging football academy in the world\n             \n \n \"We actively want to look and learn from others. EHOC asked us to go to Fulham recently and we both [Hobbs and Rivers] wanted to be there and it was beneficial.  \n \"We speak about wanting our players to be lifelong learners, but we also want our coaches to be lifelong learners too. That's how the club moves forward.\" \n Making progress \n Inside Arsenal's Academy, there is a holistic approach to making progress, individually and collectively within the coaching ranks. \n Sharing honest and constructive dialogue is regarded as essential, and on that topic Rivers is keen to share a story that struck a chord with him earlier on this season after he'd role-modelled part of a session. \n \"I have a coach who sends me voice notes after every training session and one of the most striking ones was where he asked me what I meant by 'setting traps'. \n \"He said he felt quite embarrassed that he didn't know the term when I had delivered it, but I told him I was the one who should be embarrassed because I'd assumed he was aware of it. \n \"There's a subconscious barrier to learning that coaches sometimes fall into, and we don't want that to be the case here. It was a valuable period of open reflection that was very useful for both of us. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Hobbs says looking and learning from others is extremely important\n             \n \n \"Hopefully, at Arsenal we have created a decision-rich environment where the coaches are able to make decisions for themselves,\" continues Rivers, who has also worked for Plymouth Argyle, Reading, Wycombe Wanderers, AFC Wimbledon and Farnborough Town. \n \"There are some non-negotiables in terms of our playing philosophy and core values of course, but with that there has to be room for autonomy, and for you to freely express yourself as a practitioner.\" \n To achieve Mertesacker's blueprint for developing \"Strong Young Gunners\", the Academy sets out four pillars that underpin their coaching. \n Everything they work towards is aimed at developing an \"Effective Team Player\", a \"Lifelong Learner\", someone with \"Champion Mentality\", who is also a \"Most Efficient Mover\". \n Their playing identity is aiming for each individual to master the ball so that all teams can dominate possession. \n From Under-9s to Under-23s, every age group has three coaches. It is felt that a small coach-to-player ratio is really important to develop every player as every player matters. \n They all have very clear roles and responsibilities. The head coach is responsible for team tactics and playing style. One assistant coach is responsible for individual techniques and football coordination. The other assistant coach is responsible for game insight and decision making. \n \n \n \"We speak about wanting our players to be lifelong learners, but we also want our coaches to be lifelong learners too\" \n \n Luke Hobbs, head of academy coaching at Arsenal \n \n \n \n Improving players is the name of the game, but as the conversation develops, it is abundantly clear that there is also a strong will for every coach within Arsenal's Academy to raise their own levels year on year too. \n Hobbs puts together regular development action plans for all their head coaches, and everyone at Hale End is actively encouraged to upskill through courses and workshops run by the FA. \n Finding balance  \n Monthly playing style CPD meetings (Continued Professional Development) take place to ensure there is a clear line on how they want their teams to play, and Hobbs will also meet phase leads at least once a month for progress reports. \n \"In football you talk about individuals-units-team and on the coaching side we do the same,\" he says. \n \"In this role I will spend time working with an individual coach, with a cluster unit of coaches within a phase, and then I'll sit down with our team of coaches as a whole. \n \"Putting together a successful coaching team is very similar to picking a starting eleven as a head coach. I have to select a team where I put the best people in the right positions at the right time. You constantly assess and review that.\" \n Creating pathways is also key to a happy working environment according to Hobbs, who previously worked in youth development at Southend United, Cambridge United and Peterborough United during a coaching career that now spans 24 years. \n \"We are really proud of the number of coaches who have worked at pre-academy level that have now taken opportunities to work at Hale End, and a number have gone from part-time to full-time positions. \n \"We’ve seen coaches go from working at Hale End to London Colney, and then gone from working at the academy to joining the FA in important roles. We absolutely celebrate all of that. \n \"We can't govern anyone's direction or journey. We will sit with an individual coach at the start of the year and ask them what they want to be, where they want to go, and once we establish that we can try and help them. \n \"Balancing what the coaches want, with what the players need is really important – but we do want our coaches to see that there is a pathway. \n \"If our coaches are content and believe they are developing with us, then hopefully this will rub off on the players, and they will be happy as well.\" \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Academy coaches broaden horizons with comedy Part 3:  Hobbs: Support for coaches is incredibly important Part 4:  Binnion: League helps take me out of my comfort zone as a coach Part 5:  Building connection with players is key to coaching \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout looks at clubs who can be paired together effectively to help  Fantasy Premier League  managers make a strong start in 2022/23. \n Aston Villa and AFC Bournemouth \n Aston Villa  were among the best defences in Fantasy in the previous campaign. \n Their total of 11 clean sheets was bettered by only six other sides, level with  Brighton & Hove Albion  and  Wolverhampton Wanderers . \n AFC Bournemouth , meanwhile, return to the Premier League boasting the best defensive record in last season’s Championship. \n The Cherries recorded 21 shutouts and conceded only 39 goals on their way to finishing second to  Fulham . \n Villa and AFC Bournemouth combine to provide Fantasy managers with a very favourable run of opponents from the start of the season. \n Indeed, by playing the defender with the strongest fixture, managers would face a promoted opponent in five of the first 12 Gameweeks. \n How to rotate from the start \n \n \n \n GW \n Team \n Opp \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n AVL \n BOU (A) \n \n \n 2 \n AVL \n EVE (H) \n \n \n 3 \n AVL \n CRY (A) \n \n \n 4 \n AVL \n WHU (H) \n \n \n 5 \n BOU \n WOL (H) \n \n \n 6 \n BOU \n NFO (A) \n \n \n 7 \n BOU \n BHA (H) \n \n \n 8 \n AVL \n SOU (H) \n \n \n 9 \n BOU \n BRE (H) \n \n \n 10 \n AVL \n NFO (A) \n \n \n 11 \n BOU \n FUL (A) \n \n \n 12 \n AVL \n FUL (A) \n \n \n \n Goalkeepers Emiliano Martinez and Mark Travers could appeal to managers who like to rotate between the posts. \n Travers made more saves than any other promoted ‘keeper in 2021/22 and can be a major source of value. \n Both Villa and AFC Bournemouth also have defenders who can reward investment at both ends of the pitch. \n Villa’s Matty Cash profited from new head coach Steven Gerrard’s preference for attacking full-backs last term.  \n The right-back combined three goals and three assists with nine clean sheets from Gameweek 12 onwards. \n Cash goal v Everton \n \n \n Cash Money. 💥  @MattyCash622   pic.twitter.com/RWLOkcWvdB \n— Aston Villa (@AVFCOfficial)  September 18, 2021 \n \n If Cash is too expensive to rotate, Tyrone Mings could be the best value option in the Villa backline. \n A major threat from set-pieces, he has five goals and eight assists in the last three campaigns. \n Left-back Jordan Zemura was AFC Bournemouth’s standout performer in defence in 2021/22. \n The Zimbabwe international scored three goals and supplied an assist in 33 Championship appearances. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  How to guarantee home matches for your picks Part 2:  Pair up Leeds and Brentford for great early fixtures Part 3:  Cucurella and Justin can combine for returns Part 5:  Guehi and Jonny can reward early investment Part 6:  Team up White and Burn for clean sheets \n",

        "text": "\n The Premier League has a vision to develop a world-leading coaching development system by elevating the quality of coaching across the English system through its  Elite Coaching Plan .   \n As part of this, we are showcasing in a series of articles, how the Premier League is leading a positive change in the global perception of our coaching at academy and first-team levels, as well as increasing the diversity of the coaching workforce.  \n Coach Inclusion and Diversity Scheme \n Coaches from the Premier League's  Coach Inclusion and Diversity Scheme (CIDS)  had their imagination and humour tested spending a day learning improvised comedy skills at The Comedy School in London. \n \"This scheme has been imperative to me, progressing as a coach,\" says Burnley academy coach Pierce Kiembi. \n \"There were some funny activities there that I'm definitely going to be taking away with me, because I feel like they are good ice-breakers and they also help you think on your feet.\" \n CIDS was launched in 2020/21 to support the Premier League's aim to improve diversity and coaching pathways for black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups in football, as laid out in its  No Room for Racism Action Plan  and  Elite Coaching Plan . \n It is one of the ways in which the Premier League is working to increase the diversity of this coaching workforce, making it more representative of the playing population.  \n Kiembi was one of a number of participants encouraged by the event to adopt a philosophy of open-mindedness and creativity towards their coaching, in an environment far removed from what they are used to. \n Safe environment \n Luka Sorba, a teacher at The Comedy School, is looking to give the coaches a different perspective on their role and think of methods they may not have considered otherwise. \n \"One thing we've learnt from those in the football industry is that more and more coaching and learning is very structured,\" he says. \n \"That may get its results, but the danger is that you miss out on what you could achieve in a loose environment particularly some of the self-expression and creativity. \n \"So, we create an environment where people feel safe in experimenting and taking a few more risks.\" \n Dave Regis, the Premier League's Professional Player to Coach Manager, is expecting the coaches to return to their clubs and put into practice the skills they have learnt. \n \"Coaching is... creative,\" Regis says. \"You know, you can plan a session and that session may not go the way you think it's going to go. \n \"And, in that instance, you have to be able to innovate and try things a little bit different, make mistakes, work with other coaches and come up with different ideas in the moment.\" \n Coach Index \n Another way in which the Premier League is looking to diversify its coaching workforce is through the  Coach Index , a self-registration system providing black, Asian, mixed heritage and female coaches with access to information about employment and development opportunities within professional football. \n The Index has been created in collaboration with  The FA ,  EFL ,  LMA  and  PFA  and enables relevant coaches with a minimum of an FA Level 2 or UEFA C Licence qualification to sign up for alerts from clubs and football partners. Registered coaches will be signposted to relevant coaching opportunities, as well as updates on accessible professional learning and development activity. \n How to sign up for the Coach Index \n \n \n Have you signed up for The Coach Index? 📝 The initiative aims to provide black, Asian, mixed heritage and female coaches with information about employment opportunities in professional football 📋 Register here ➡️  https://t.co/E18eNvPZc4   pic.twitter.com/RLO7CvIcjy \n— Premier League (@premierleague)  May 9, 2022 \n \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  Hobbs: To help players we must help coaches Part 3:  Elite coach programme opening minds and doors Part 4:  Binnion: League helps take me out of my comfort zone as a coach Part 5:  Building connection with players is key to coaching \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout looks at clubs who can be paired together effectively to help  Fantasy Premier League  managers make a strong start in 2022/23. \n Brighton and Leicester \n Brighton & Hove Albion  were among the best defences in Fantasy last season keeping 11 clean sheets, a total that was only bettered by six other sides. \n The Seagulls conceded just 44 goals in 2021/22, placing them sixth overall; only last season's top four and  Wolverhampton Wanderers  let in fewer. \n Leicester City , meanwhile, were far more reliable for defensive returns at King Power Stadium. \n The Foxes claimed six of their seven clean sheets at home. That total was surpassed by only six other sides, level with Brighton and  Chelsea .  \n Brighton and Leicester combine to provide managers with a very favourable run of opponents from the start of the season. \n How to rotate from the start \n \n \n \n GW \n Team \n Opp \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n LEI \n BRE (H) \n \n \n 2 \n BHA \n NEW (H) \n \n \n 3 \n LEI \n SOU (H) \n \n \n 4 \n BHA \n LEE (H) \n \n \n 5 \n BHA \n FUL (A) \n \n \n 6 \n BHA \n LEI (H) \n \n \n 7 \n LEI \n AVL (H) \n \n \n 8 \n BHA \n CRY (H) \n \n \n 9 \n LEI \n NFO (H) \n \n \n 10 \n LEI \n BOU (A) \n \n \n 11 \n LEI \n CRY (H) \n \n \n 12 \n BHA \n NFO (H) \n \n \n \n By selecting the side with the best fixture, they would face only one of last term’s top 10 in the first 12 Gameweeks. This occurs in Gameweek 6,  when the two clubs meet at Amex Stadium . \n Crucially, this pairing offers 10 home matches over that period.  \n Indeed, on the two occasions when managers would have to pick a player with an away match, both those fixtures are against promoted sides. \n Those occur in Gameweek 5,  when Brighton visit Fulham , and in Gameweek 10, when  Leicester travel to AFC Bournemouth . \n Pairing up Robert Sanchez and Kasper Schmeichel could appeal to managers who prefer to rotate their goalkeepers. \n Best of Sanchez 2021/22 \n \n \n Loads and loads of Sanchez saves. 😍🧤  pic.twitter.com/AGuHR47l7r \n— Brighton & Hove Albion (@OfficialBHAFC)  June 21, 2022 \n \n Both Brighton and Leicester also boast defenders with strong all-round potential. \n Seagulls wing-back Marc Cucurella combined a goal and an assist with 11 clean sheets and 21 bonus points over his 35 appearances last term. \n Having returned from a long-term injury, Leicester full-back James Justin could also reward investors. \n He averaged 4.4 points per match in 2020/21, thanks to two goals, two assists, nine clean sheets and 13 bonus. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  How to guarantee home matches for your picks Part 2:  Pair up Leeds and Brentford for great early fixtures Part 4:  Mings and Zemura a value pairing Part 5:  Guehi and Jonny can reward early investment Part 6:  Team up White and Burn for clean sheets \n",

They recorded a shutout in four of their final five matches.  \n Leeds United , meanwhile, were boosted by the arrival of Jesse Marsch as head coach in Gameweek 28. \n They had conceded 60 goals in the first 27 Gameweeks with Marcelo Bielsa in charge, more than any other side. \n But they tightened up at the back under Marsch, allowing only 19 goals in their final 12 encounters.  \n That total was better than eight teams, including top-half clubs such as  Wolverhampton Wanderers ,  Arsenal  and  Manchester United . \n Strong rotation \n Brentford and Leeds combine to offer a favourable run of opponents in the early stages of 2022/23. \n By selecting the side with the better fixture each Gameweek, managers can avoid all of last season’s top nine in the opening seven rounds of matches. \n How to rotate from the start \n \n \n \n GW \n Team \n Opp \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n LEE \n WOL (H) \n \n \n 2 \n LEE \n SOU (A) \n \n \n 3 \n BRE \n FUL (A) \n \n \n 4 \n BRE \n EVE (H) \n \n \n 5 \n LEE \n EVE (H) \n \n \n 6 \n BRE \n LEE (H) \n \n \n 7 \n LEE \n NFO (H) \n \n \n \n David Raya and Illan Meslier could prove a popular pair for managers who like to rotate their goalkeepers. \n Both Brentford and Leeds have defenders who boast strong attacking potential, offering the prospect of points at both ends of the pitch.  \n The Bees’ Pontus Jansson was involved in seven goals last season, scoring three and assisting a further four. \n Jansson goal v Southampton \n \n \n 🦊  @PJansson5  the fox in the box #BrentfordFC   @SafetyCultureHQ   pic.twitter.com/ppKjsmoCyv \n— Brentford FC (@BrentfordFC)  May 7, 2022 \n \n His 22 shots in the box placed joint-tenth among all defenders in Fantasy last season.  \n Leeds’ new right-back Rasmus Kristensen reunites with Marsch at Elland Road, having played under the American during his time at Red Bull Salzburg. \n The Dane scored 10 goals and supplied eight assists in 44 appearances across all competitions for the Austrian side in 2021/22. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  How to guarantee home matches for your picks Part 3:  Cucurella and Justin can combine for returns Part 4:  Mings and Zemura a value pairing Part 5:  Guehi and Jonny can reward early investment Part 6:  Team up White and Burn for clean sheets \n",

        "summary": "Adrian Clarke explains why Croat can be one of the Premier League's best wing-backs in 2022/23",
        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke analyses players who have changed clubs this summer and can make an impact in 2022/23. \n Ivan Perisic (TOT) \n Antonio Conte did not settle on a first-choice left wing-back for  Tottenham Hotspur  last season, switching between  Sergio Reguilon ,  Ryan Sessegnon  and  Matt Doherty . \n \n \n \n \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 1 \n \n SOU \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n All three did well in spells, but none of them cemented a position which is likely to be occupied by summer arrival Perisic in 2022/23. \n The 33-year-old Croatia international worked with  Conte  at Inter Milan and, on the back of an impressive Serie A campaign, he should be an excellent fit down that wing. \n Big-match player \n In recent years, Perisic has proved himself to be a consistent performer who regularly raises his game for the big occasions. \n He has scored 14 goals for Croatia at major tournaments, including one in the 2018 FIFA World Cup final. \n He was also superb at the business end of Inter’s 2021/22 Serie A campaign. \n He scored three goals and provided six assists in their last 10 league matches, while in the Coppa Italia final he netted twice in extra-time to secure a victory over Juventus. \n Loves to cross \n Conte’s teams always use the full width of the pitch, so Perisic will be viewed as a key addition. \n Conte's Spurs team delivered the second-highest number of successful crosses from open play last season, behind only  Liverpool , and Perisic’s arrival will significantly strengthen their quality in this area. \n Despite making only six starts in last season’s UEFA Champions League (UCL), it was Perisic who produced the most crosses from open play in the competition. \n Most open-play crosses in UCL \n \n \n \n 2021/22 \n Starts \n Crosses \n \n \n \n \n Ivan Perisic \n 6 \n 40 \n \n \n Trent Alexander-Arnold \n 9 \n 38 \n \n \n Dusan Tadic \n 7 \n 38 \n \n \n Kingsley Coman \n 8 \n 36 \n \n \n Riyad Mahrez \n 11 \n 29 \n \n \n \n Spurs fans can expect Perisic to speed down the left side before delivering dangerous crosses for  Harry Kane  to attack. \n Seven of his nine assists in all competitions last term came from crosses whipped in from that side. \n While he can produce quality from deeper areas, his trademark delivery is standing the ball up for team-mates who are arriving at the far post. \n These balls are hard to stop because Perisic is two-footed and can produce quality on his right or left side.  \n Set-piece threat \n Spurs only scored eight goals from set-plays last season, with only Norwich City, Watford and  Manchester United  netting fewer. \n The arrival of Perisic increases their goal threat enormously. \n He usually occupies a position inside the box, attacking the cross. \n Four of his 10 goals for Inter last season came from corners, with three of them being brilliant near-post headers. \n Still going strong \n He may be approaching his mid-thirties, but Perisic still has a strong enough engine to perform a demanding role as a wing-back. \n He started 35 out of 38 league matches last season and still has the pace to beat full-backs on the outside. \n Perisic's UCL stats 2021/22 \n \n \n \n   \n Perisic \n Inter rank \n \n \n \n \n Starts \n 6 \n 7th \n \n \n Open-play crosses \n 40 \n 1st \n \n \n Dribbles completed \n 6 \n 1st \n \n \n Chances created \n 14 \n 2nd \n \n \n Shots \n 11 \n 3rd \n \n \n Touches in opp. box \n 33 \n 3rd \n \n \n \n His defending is adequate but not a core strength, meaning it is his attacking qualities that have attracted Spurs’ attention. \n Domestically and in Europe, Perisic was among Inter’s most prominent attacking players in 2021/22. \n He will regularly get into the final third and, once there, he has the talent to hurt opponents with a crisp strike or accurate final ball. \n This is a short-term fix for Spurs that should instantly improve their starting XI. \n See:   Talking Tactics: New signings for 2022/23 \n",

        "text": "\n As part of the Premier League  celebrating five years of Premier League Primary Stars , clubs running the school programme have nominated a \"Superstar\" - a young person or teacher who has inspired others through their dedication to the scheme, enthusiasm and own personal development. \n Delia (Everton) \n For any young person, having positive role models to help guide them in the right direction, providing inspiration and support, is crucial. \n Delia O'Neill has emerged as a key figurehead to youngsters at the  Holy Trinity Primary School  in Liverpool, after working with the Premier League Primary Stars programme and  Everton in the Community  (EITC). \n \"Our school got involved with Premier League Primary Stars because we wanted the PE provision in the school to improve and to be a higher standard,\" says Delia.  \n \"I would not say I was very confident at teaching PE, but with the planning and the structure that they've put in place, they've really made me feel that I'm now delivering much higher-quality lessons which ultimately helps our children, which is what we're all here for.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Thomas is one of the many pupils to have benefited from Delia's improved confidence and different methods of delivering PE sessions. \n \"Since Everton have come in it's had a massive effect on her PE lessons,\" he says. \"She inspires the kids that are coming through the years and she's very supportive, and if you need help then she'll give you that help. \n Holy Trinity now delivers sessions three days a week with the support from EITC, both in the classroom with English interventions and maths interventions, along with physical activities outside. \n \n \n Launched in 2017 and available to every primary school in England and Wales,  #PLPrimaryStars  uses the appeal of the  #PL  and professional football clubs to support pupils in the classroom, the playground and on the sports field 🙌 Why we're celebrating ➡️  https://t.co/xeiPawQBvI   pic.twitter.com/8qOzmKcsN0 \n— Premier League Communities (@PLCommunities)  June 20, 2022 \n \n \"We've also done a lot of workshops on racism and LGBTQ+ - that's because of how much Delia has valued the programme with us,\" says Elena Barton, sports coach at EITC. \n \"Delia has been selected as Everton in the Community's Premier League Primary Stars ‘Superstar’ because she has really developed and embedded herself in the programme in so many ways.\" \n Positive progress \n Holy Trinity and Delia have been working with EITC and Premier League Primary Stars for over five years and their positive relationship continues to pay off. \n The school reached gold level in the Liverpool Reading Quality Mark, an award that recognises the efforts made in promoting the joy of reading among their pupils. \n \"The programme has been so successful that it has just grown and grown,\" adds Delia. \"We are now a flagship school for  Everton .\" \n Visit  PLPrimaryStars.com   for more information. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Premier League celebrates five years of Primary Stars Part 2:  William's story (Leicester City) Part 3:  Harry's story (Forest Green Rovers) Part 4:  Stephanie's story (Charlton Athletic) Part 5:  Faizan's story (Burnley) Part 6:  The Godolphin Junior Academy's story (Slough) Part 7:  Freya's story (Newport County) \n",

        "text": "\n An important focus of the Premier League Academy programme is the development of younger players off the pitch as well as on it. \n To mark Mental Health Awareness Week, broadcaster and Arsenal fan Roman Kemp met former Gunners defender and now Academy manager Per Mertesacker to find out how the club look after the mental wellbeing of the players in their care. \n \"Everything is decided between our ears so we need to be conscious of that, how we engage, how we build a connection,\" Mertesacker says. \"This is a football club but this is so much much than just kicking a ball around. \n \"This is a key part of our philosophy of building strong, young Gunners where we speak about football performance and the team, how to be effective, but we speak as well about lifelong learning and what that means.\" \n Holistic development \n This holistic development of Academy players is a key strand of the  Elite Player Performance Plan  (EPPP), which was introduced in 2012. \n The EPPP enables clubs to develop both the player and the person, by providing a wide range of educational and welfare activities designed to enhance learning as well as providing life skills. \n Read more:  PL Academies give positive experience, say parents \n Premier League rules ensure players at all Premier League clubs, from the Academy upwards, receive a variety of support for their mental health from their clubs and the League. This goes from the Under-9s all the way up to the first team. \n All clubs are obliged to conduct sessions with their contracted players and implement a Mental and Emotional Wellbeing Action Plan. \n Academy players also have access to mental health resources and support through the Premier League’s partnership with the NSPCC. \n Striking a balance \n \"That's where our responsibility comes in to keep that balance of challenging a side but also having people around who really take care of them,\" Mertesacker says. \n \"Sometimes football is the place where players can be totally free from their struggles but sometimes you see clearly that something is not right with someone's performances and we need to be really careful how we judge them. \n \"Wellbeing is so linked to your performance so these things are crucially important to us that we address safe spaces for our players to go in where they can have conversations plus our player-care team around the pitch, where they can really spot different behaviours - that was all initiated by the Premier League.\" \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  UK football family reaffirms commitment to mental health Part 2:  McAtee: Team-mates can help your mental health Part 3:  Lennon: I didn't realise there was so much help around Part 5:  Mertesacker: We need to be able to express our feelings Part 6:  Premier League managers unite to tackle suicide Part 7:  Ruddy: Mental health project helps people let off steam Part 8:  Kemp: Opening up helped my mental health Part 9:  'Saints Foundation has been a lifeline for me' \n",

        "text": "\n Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) has released a statement saying that Managing Director Mike Riley will step down from his role this coming season. \n The statement says: \"Managing Director of PGMOL Mike Riley has confirmed he will step down from his role this coming season. \n Riley has led the organisation for 13 years, overseeing the development of match officials in the Premier League, FA, EFL and National League competitions and more recently the Women’s Super League.\" \n Mike Riley said: “I am proud of the contribution our match officials have made to the professional game and have enjoyed working with a such a dedicated, professional and high-quality group at all of the levels that PGMOL manages.  \n “As the Elite Referee Development Plan begins to take shape, now is the right time to plan for the future and allow the new leadership team to build on the strong foundations that we have in place. I look forward to working with the new team over the next season and giving them my support before I step down.”   \n Premier League Chief Executive Richard Masters said: “On behalf of the Premier League, I would like to thank Mike for his valuable contribution and significant commitment to PGMOL over the last 13 years as well as his considerable service to the game as an elite referee for 20 years.  \n “During his time at PGMOL, he has worked hard to deliver and develop high-quality match officials across the professional game and led on the implementation of VAR into the Premier League three seasons ago.”  \n FA Chief Executive Mark Bullingham said: “Mike Riley has played a crucial role in the development of refereeing over recent years, both as an elite referee and during his tenure at PGMOL. On behalf of The FA, I’d like to thank Mike for his dedication and commitment to refereeing and wish him all the best for the future.” \n EFL Chief Executive Trevor Birch, said: “I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mike, on behalf of the EFL, for the important role he has played in developing refereeing in the professional game and wish him well for the future.  \n “During an unprecedented 13 years at the helm, he has overseen a number of significant developments to match officiating; most notably in the EFL, the introduction of Select Group 2 match officials and goal line technology alongside greater training and support for National List officials.”  \n PGMOL Chairman Mike Foster said: “Mike’s commitment to refereeing and the game in England has been immense, underpinned by his magnificent dedication and loyalty. Our match officials are recognised and valued over the world and that is testament to Mike’s vast leadership abilities. He will depart having created a lasting legacy.” \n PGMOL will in due course confirm the appointment of a Chief Refereeing Officer to oversee the continued development of match officials and a Chief Operating Officer to manage the organisation.  \n",

        "text": "\n As part of the Premier League  celebrating five years of Premier League Primary Stars , clubs running the school programme have nominated a \"Superstar\" - a young person or teacher who has inspired others through their dedication to the scheme, enthusiasm and own personal development. \n Freya (Newport County) \n For women and girls such as 10-year-old Freya, from Newport, opportunities to play football have never been greater but having the confidence to do so can remain a barrier. \n With the help of Premier League Primary Stars and Dan Harvey, School Sports coordinator at  County in the Community , Freya is now playing her favourite sport with a smile on her face. \n \"When Dan and Newport County come in to school we do lots of fun activities. We play lots of games, practising skills and play lots of football,\" says Freya, a pupil at St Joseph's RC Primary School. \n \"I've joined a club now, we train on Fridays and play proper matches on Sundays. \n \"At first I felt a bit nervous and didn't really know what to do. Now I feel really joyful when I play. I've really enjoyed my progress.\" \n As Freya's football skills have blossomed - she was recently selected to represent Newport and District Schools - so too has her personal development. \n \n \n Launched in 2017 and available to every primary school in England and Wales,  #PLPrimaryStars  uses the appeal of the  #PL  and professional football clubs to support pupils in the classroom, the playground and on the sports field 🙌 Why we're celebrating ➡️  https://t.co/xeiPawQBvI   pic.twitter.com/8qOzmKcsN0 \n— Premier League Communities (@PLCommunities)  June 20, 2022 \n \n \"Since she's been taking part in Premier League Primary Stars Freya's more confident, she's more active in the classroom, she speaks more and contributes to class discussions,\" says Year 5 teacher, Stephanie Jones. \n \"She has developed herself as more of a leader, not just in the sports field but in the classroom activities and the school parliament.\" \n Dreaming big \n St Joseph's are in their third year of working with Premier League Primary Stars, joining over 18,500 primary schools in England and Wales who are engaging with the programme. \n \"I've been delivering Premier League Primary Stars since its inception,\" says Harvey, \"And [seen] the impact it's had across the city. \n \"The funding provided to us by the Premier League has been crucial to allow us to engage with thousands of young people across the Newport and wider Gwent area.\" \n Freya is just one of those to have benefited from the programme and has impressed as a role model for other aspiring girl footballers. \n \"She's encouraged other girls in the classroom to go along as well,\" adds Jones. \"Out of my girls there's now six or seven that play football with Freya on a weekend.\" \n Visit  PLPrimaryStars.com   for more information. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Premier League celebrates five years of PL Primary Stars Part 2:  William's story (Leicester City) Part 3:  Harry's story (Forest Green Rovers) Part 4:  Stephanie's story (Charlton Athletic) Part 5:  Faizan's story (Burnley) Part 6:  The Godolphin Junior Academy's story (Slough) Part 8:  Delia's story (Everton) \n",

        "text": "\n Players in  Fantasy Premier League  often star in home matches, so wouldn't it be handy if Fantasy managers could guarantee as many home fixtures for their squad as possible? \n The release of the 2022/23 fixture list has revealed a way that you can do so. \n There are some team pairings, such as  Arsenal  and  Tottenham Hotspur , that alternate home and away over the whole season. \n In each Gameweek, managers can select the player who is at home while benching the one who has the away match. \n This strategy is mainly restricted to two cut-price players, either goalkeepers or defenders. \n Fantasy managers should therefore seek out value pairings that offer the best potential for clean sheets. \n 2022/23 rotation pairings \n \n \n \n Team 1 \n Team 2 \n \n \n \n \n ARS \n TOT \n \n \n AVL \n BOU \n \n \n BRE \n WHU \n \n \n BHA \n LEE \n \n \n CHE \n FUL \n \n \n CRY \n WOL \n \n \n EVE \n LIV \n \n \n LEI \n NFO \n \n \n MCI \n MUN \n \n \n NEW \n SOU \n \n \n \n Newcastle United  and  Southampton  are a good example from the table above. \n The Magpies kept five of their eight clean sheets last season at St James' Park. \n Saints were also more reliable in defence when playing in home matches.  \n They produced six shutouts at St Mary's Stadium but managed a mere two on the road, the second-fewest in the league. \n If their defensive regulars are handed budget price-tags this season, rotating Newcastle and Southampton players for home matches could provide major value. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  Pair up Leeds and Brentford for great early fixtures Part 3:  Cucurella and Justin can combine for returns Part 4:  Mings and Zemura a value pairing Part 5:  Guehi and Jonny can reward early investment Part 6:  Team up White and Burn for clean sheets \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout assesses the sides with the most favourable opening schedules in 2022/23  Fantasy Premier League . \n Wolverhampton Wanderers \n Wolves' wing-backs could prove a handy source of value for managers in Fantasy in the early rounds of fixtures. \n Bruno Lage’s side kept 11 clean sheets in 2021/22, a total bettered by only six other sides.  \n Wolves' first six PL matches \n \n \n \n GW \n Opp \n GW \n Opp \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n LEE (A) \n 4 \n NEW (H) \n \n \n 2 \n FUL (H) \n 5 \n BOU (A) \n \n \n 3 \n TOT (A) \n 6 \n SOU (H) \n \n \n \n And they can quickly attract the attention of managers in Fantasy this season. \n Wolves face just one of last term’s top six in their first six fixtures,  visiting Tottenham Hotspur in Gameweek 3 . \n Jonny  \n After missing most of 2021/22 due to injury, the Spaniard was quick to secure the role as right wing-back in Wolves’ first campaign under Lage. \n Jonny scored twice in 10 starts, also collecting two clean sheets and two bonus points. \n His all-round style of play can profit from Wolves’ schedule, which includes  meetings with promoted pair Fulham  and  AFC Bournemouth  in their first five matches.  \n Rayan Ait-Nouri \n The Frenchman’s displays at Molineux suggest he could be a strong rotation option in defence for Fantasy managers. \n Ait-Nouri averaged 4.7 points per match (ppm) at home in 2021/22, compared with 2.6 ppm on the road.  \n \n \n \n Indeed, all of his attacking returns last season, one goal and four assists, were recorded in home contests. \n Encouragingly for Ait-Nouri, Wolves entertain Fulham,  Newcastle United  and  Southampton  in the first six Gameweeks. \n Pedro Neto \n Another to have missed most of last season through injury, Neto can emerge as a key figure for Wolves this term. \n Neto scored five goals and supplied eight assists in his last full campaign in Fantasy in 2020/21. \n His all-round influence that season is reinforced by the statistics. Neto's 21 shots on target and 61 chances created were both team-leading totals. \n Neto is expected to cost no more than £6.5m at the start of 2022/23, lifting his potential as a mid-price source of points in midfield. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Profit from Man City's kind start Part 2:  Invest early in Liverpool trio Part 3:  Arsenal can make fast start Part 4:  Double up on Chelsea duo \n",

This was where they were at their best last term, springing fast breaks to hurt the opposition. \n Johnson, who excelled on loan for Lincoln City in 2020/21 in League One, is integral to that approach. \n Thanks to his speed and mobility, he produced the second-most shots from fast breaks last season. \n Johnson's attacking stats 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Championship \n Johnson \n League rank \n \n \n \n \n Big chance conversion* \n 75% \n 1st \n \n \n Shots from fast breaks \n 11 \n 2nd \n \n \n Shots from inside box \n 77 \n 5th \n \n \n Chances created from open play \n 61 \n 5th \n \n \n \n * Minimum 10 big chances \n Johnson was at his most impressive in key matches. \n He scored in both legs of the Championship playoff semi-final against Sheffield United and starred in memorable FA Cup victories over  Arsenal  and  Leicester City , netting against the Foxes. \n Statistically, Johnson boasted the highest conversion rate from big chances in the second tier, scoring with 75 per cent of those opportunities. \n He also offers terrific creativity, regularly showcasing his skill down the flanks to set up team-mates. \n In open play, just four Championship players created more chances than he did last term. \n Premier League defenders will not just be wary of Johnson’s speed but also the direct way in which he brings the ball forward. \n Average ball carry comparison \n \n \n \n Player \n Ave. ball carry distance \n Ave. ball carry progress \n \n \n \n \n Johnson (NFO) \n 14.8m \n 10.5m \n \n \n Bowler (QPR) \n 14.1m \n 10.4m \n \n \n Kebano (FUL)  \n 12.0m \n 7.4m \n \n \n \n Last season he carried the ball 14.8 metres on average and made more progress than any other Championship player (10.5m on average). \n Five of his carries resulted in assists and three ended with him scoring. \n Ryan Yates \n The most-improved player since Cooper took charge is Yates, a homegrown central midfielder who has developed into an all-action star. \n The 24-year-old gets around the pitch superbly to break up play and is excellent at dropping into his own area to clear danger. \n However, it is his unexpected goalscoring prowess last term that elevated his status. \n Scoring eight times in his last 36 Championship appearances, compared with six in his previous 84, Yates delivered end product at crucial moments throughout Forest's promotion campaign. \n He is very good at making late runs into the opposition box. From one such burst, he helped to force Levi Colwill’s own-goal winner against Huddersfield Town in the Championship playoff final. \n \n \n The winning goal at Wembley. ⚽️ 🌳🔴  #NFFC   pic.twitter.com/7hIqUGhtvM \n— Nottingham Forest FC (@NFFC)  May 31, 2022 \n \n Yates also boasts a real threat from corners and wide free-kicks. \n No Championship player registered more goals from set-pieces in 2021/22, with seven of his eight strikes coming from dead-balls. \n In a season where set-plays are likely to be of huge significance for Forest, Yates is very much their danger man. \n Championship set-piece goals 21/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Set-piece goals (exc. pens) \n \n \n \n \n Yates (NFO) \n 7 \n \n \n Mitrovic (FUL) \n 6 \n \n \n Crooks (MID) \n 5 \n \n \n Solanke (BOU) \n 5 \n \n \n Ekpiteta (BLP) \n 5 \n \n \n \n Despite operating in a box-to-box role, Yates is Forest's most defensive-minded midfielder. \n He will help out his three central defenders when crosses come into the box, often covering for a centre-back who has been dragged towards the wings. \n For this reason, and his strength when defending set-pieces, Yates' 91 clearances were far more than anyone else who played in central midfield for the majority of last season. \n He also makes a string of interceptions and wins more than his fair share of tackles and headers. \n Top stats for midfielders 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Aerial duels won \n Player \n Clearances \n \n \n \n \n Crooks (MID) \n 146 \n Yates \n 91 \n \n \n Yates (NFO) \n 108 \n Gardner \n 65 \n \n \n Gardner (BIR) \n 100 \n Smallwood (HUL)  \n 60 \n \n \n \n Yates has offered plenty for Forest in every area, on and off the ball, during a brilliant promotion campaign. \n Forest supporters will now be hoping he can take that form into the Premier League. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Fulham back with exciting attack Part 2:  Wilson to deliver for Fulham again Part 3:  Parker has the tools to succeed Part 4:  Kelly and Billing key for Cherries Part 5:  Forest counters can cause problems \n",

They kept eight clean sheets from that point, a total bettered by just five other sides. \n Pope v Dubravka save ratio \n \n \n \n Season \n Pope \n Dubravka \n \n \n \n \n 17/18 \n 77.0% \n 70.3% \n \n \n 18/19 \n Injured \n 67.4% \n \n \n 19/20 \n 71.9% \n 71.8% \n \n \n 20/21 \n 76.5% \n 72.6% \n \n \n 21/22 \n 73.3% \n 68.9% \n \n \n \n Certainly, the statistics suggest Pope has the safer pair of hands. \n He has saved 74.7 per cent of the shots he has faced in his four seasons in the Premier League.  \n Dubravka, meanwhile, has saved 70.2 per cent of the shots he has faced since joining the Magpies in 2017/18. \n Ultimately, Pope’s appeal in Fantasy is very likely to be dictated by his cost. \n If he is priced higher than some of Newcastle’s regular defenders then the Magpies’ backline could be the best route of investment.  \n See:  The Scout's FPL new signings \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at key tactical elements and players of the three clubs joining the Premier League in 2022/23. \n Nottingham Forest \n Forest return after a 23-year exile from the Premier League with their defining feature being their ability to punish opponents with fast transitions and counter-attacks. \n \n \n \n \n \n NEW \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 0 \n \n NFO \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n There is a great sense of momentum and unity at the City Ground, built around the amazing transformation since head coach  Steve Cooper  took charge last September. \n Cooper is acclaimed by the Forest faithful, having galvanised a struggling team languishing in the relegation zone and steered them to promotion through the Championship playoffs.  \n The Reds averaged two points per match over his 38 fixtures during the regular season, and would theoretically have finished as champions on 92 points had he been there from the start. \n Main formation \n Cooper settled Forest into a 3-4-1-2 formation during an outstanding second half of the campaign, but it is a relatively little-used shape in the Premier League. \n In last season’s competition, no team employed that system as their primary formation. \n It was used on just 15 occasions, with  Thomas Tuchel  the man to choose it the most - seven times with  Chelsea . \n Cooper's formations in 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Formation \n Times used \n \n \n \n \n 3-4-1-2 \n 24 \n \n \n 4-2-3-1 \n 7 \n \n \n 3-4-3 \n 5 \n \n \n 3-4-2-1 \n 4 \n \n \n 3-5-2 \n 1 \n \n \n \n Cooper is a fan of this shape, using it 25 times when he was Swansea City’s head coach in 2020/21. \n It has also happened to be a formation that has suited his key players at Forest.  \n A back three of  Joe Worrall ,  Steve Cook  and  Scott McKenna  is not blessed with great pace but it has given Forest safety in numbers and the unit have gelled together. \n Djed Spence, on loan from Middlesbrough, was ideal as a right wing-back last term, while Philip Zinckernagel - loaned from Watford - was at his best in a free No 10 role. \n It will be interesting to see who will play these roles in the Premier League.  \n New role for Johnson \n Cooper has also been keen to start his most dangerous attacker,  Brennan Johnson , in a striker’s role where he can run in behind the last man. \n Having previously operated as a winger, and unaccustomed to playing up front, the Welshman has worked best alongside a natural centre-forward. \n Johnson goal v Sheff Utd \n \n \n 1️⃣8️⃣ goals this season for  #OneOfOurOwn  🏹  🌳🔴  #NFFC   pic.twitter.com/DWJDB19OU3 \n— Nottingham Forest FC (@NFFC)  May 14, 2022 \n \n It would be a surprise to see Forest deviate away from 3-4-1-2 in the early stages of 2022/23, but much will depend on who they recruit this summer. \n If they are unable to keep hold of loanees  James Garner  and  Keinan Davis  as well as Spence and Zinckernagel, Cooper is likely to target players of a similar style to maintain this shape. \n Top attacking Championship teams 21/22 \n \n \n \n Team \n Direct attacks \n Fast breaks \n Shots from fast breaks \n \n \n \n \n NFO \n 97 \n 33 \n 28 \n \n \n COV \n 97 \n 30 \n 25 \n \n \n BLB \n -

        "summary": "How weekly sessions with Burnley FC in the Community opened up a whole new world for one student",
        "text": "\n As part of the Premier League  celebrating five years of Premier League Primary Stars , clubs running the school programme have nominated a \"Superstar\" - a young person or teacher who has inspired others through their dedication to the scheme, enthusiasm and own personal development. \n Faizan (Burnley) \n Premier League Primary Stars has allowed Faizan, a schoolchild in Burnley, to overcome a hearing impairment and so connect with his peers and become more independent. \n \"Twelve months ago I wasn't a leader or a Sports Ambassador or anything like that,\" says Faizan, a student at Reedley Primary. \"I never had the confidence. I was more likely to be nervous.\" \n But working on a weekly basis for the past 15 months with Josh Wall, a sports and education coach at  Burnley FC in the Community  (BFCitC), using the Premier League Primary Stars programme, has changed that. \n Faizan's nervousness has been replaced by self-assurance and he supports others at school breaks, volunteering to help teach PE to the younger children at the school. \n \"With his role as a sports ambassador, it's been fantastic,\" says Faizan's class teacher, Saniah Ali. \"He's able to communicate with different people across the school. \n \"He's confident in leading activities and he's become a lot more independent, just willing to share his learning with his peers. It's brilliant for him.\" \n Solid foundations \n This is the fifth year in which BFCitC has been involved in Premier League Primary Stars, which works with 105 professional football clubs from across the leagues, running sessions in local schools. \n It's not just Faizan at the school who has benefited from the programme and Burnley's delivery of it. \n \"Being in four days a week, I'm able to not just go and teach a sports session, but also help in other ways,\" Wall says. \n \"We've done things like healthy eating, healthy lifestyles, Black History Month. \n \"Premier League Primary Stars as part of Reedley Primary School is massive.\" \n The resources, which are free, have been developed for teachers by teachers, and in collaboration with experts such as the  National Literacy Trust  and the  PSHE Association . \n Visit  PLPrimaryStars.com   for more information. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Premier League celebrates five years of PL Primary Stars Part 2:  William's story (Leicester City) Part 3:  Harry's story (Forest Green Rovers) Part 4:  Stephanie's story (Charlton Athletic) Part 6:  Godolphin Academy's story Part 7:  Freya's story (Newport County) Part 8:  Delia's story (Everton) \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at key tactical elements of the three clubs joining the Premier League in 2022/23. \n Lloyd Kelly \n Scott Parker  named Kelly as  AFC Bournemouth  captain for 2021/22 and he embraced that responsibility by delivering an outstanding campaign. \n \n \n \n \n \n BOU \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 0 \n \n AVL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Playing as a left-sided central defender, the 23-year-old brings quality distribution, composure and pace at the back. \n The former England Under-21 international’s ability to play as a left-back, also provides his head coach with terrific tactical options. \n When  Jordan Zemura  flies forward from that position, or takes up high starting roles, Kelly is comfortable in that area, bringing the ball out with confidence. \n Plenty of pace \n Kelly is quick, which will be a precious asset for AFC Bournemouth when they come up against fast Premier League forwards. \n He is able to fill gaps quickly, especially when longer passes are played over the top or down the sides, while his pace allows the Cherries to press inside the opposition half. \n Superb in 1v1 situations, no Championship defender who started 30 or more matches last season was dribbled past on fewer occasions than Kelly. \n Championship defenders least dribbled past 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Player \n Dribbled past \n Starts \n \n \n \n \n Lloyd Kelly \n 7 \n 40 \n \n \n Tom Lees \n 7 \n 42 \n \n \n Dan McNamara \n 8 \n 33 \n \n \n Scott McKenna \n 9 \n 48 \n \n \n Tosin Adarabioyo \n 9 \n 41 \n \n \n \n *Min 30 starts \n When AFC Bournemouth have possession in defence, everything goes through Kelly, who averaged 59.28 successful passes per 90 minutes last season. \n He is a progressive passer who will move the ball into midfield, or look to hit longer passes into the opposition half. \n As a left-footer, Kelly helps AFC Bournemouth move the ball out from defence with greater fluidity than if a right-footed player were occupying the same role. \n Kelly defensive stats 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Lloyd Kelly \n Total \n Defender rank \n \n \n \n \n Possession won \n 307 \n 2nd \n \n \n Clearances \n 178 \n 6th \n \n \n Successful passes \n 2387 \n 4th \n \n \n \n Defensively, Kelly has developed enormously since making eight top-flight appearances in 2019/20. \n Last term, only one Championship defender regained possession more than he, and he was also ranked fourth for the most clearances \n Kelly’s rounded skill-set will be of critical importance next term. \n Philip Billing \n Since being taken under Parker’s wing, Billing has developed into a rampaging attacking midfielder. \n He was one of only six Championship players to achieve double-figure returns for goals and assists in 2021/22. \n The Denmark international scored just six goals and made a single assist between 2013/14 and 2019/20, so that is an impressive leap. \n Double-figures for goals and assists \n \n \n \n Player \n Goals \n Assists \n \n \n \n \n Andreas Weimann \n 22 \n 10 \n \n \n Harry Wilson \n 10 \n 19 \n \n \n Brennan Johnson \n 18 \n 10 \n \n \n John Swift \n 11 \n 13 \n \n \n Morgan Gibbs-White \n 12 \n 10 \n \n \n Philip Billing \n 10 \n 10 \n \n \n \n From a tactical perspective, Billing is a prominent figure for AFC Bournemouth. \n He can play as an orthodox central midfielder in a 4-2-3-1 formation, or as one of the attacking No 8s in a 4-3-3. \n Towards the end of last season, Parker even unleashed the 6ft 6in star into more of a free No 10 role and, in that position, he caused opponents problems. \n Using his long stride to good advantage, the 26-year-old is superb at driving into the penalty area from deep. \n His chemistry with leading scorer  Dominic Solanke , is also something Parker will hope can continue in the Premier League. \n Six of Billing’s 10 assists were for the striker. \n Billing attacking/defending statistics  \n \n \n \n Season 2021/22 \n Total \n BOU rank \n \n \n \n \n Tackles won \n 45 \n 1st \n \n \n Aerial duels won \n 85 \n 2nd \n \n \n Touches in opp box \n 143 \n 2nd \n \n \n Shots \n 63 \n 3rd \n \n \n Chances created \n 43 \n 4th \n \n \n \n Billing’s height means he has a strong aerial presence at both ends of the pitch. \n He is also their best tackler, winning more challenges than any team-mate last term. \n However, as he returns to top-flight football, it is the attacking part of his game that now stands out most. \n Parker has unlocked a midfielder who has learned how to use his power, pace, and controlled end product to become a match-winner. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Fulham back with exciting attack Part 2:  Wilson to deliver for Fulham again Part 3:  Parker has the tools to succeed Part 5:  Forest counters can cause problems Part 6:  Johnson and Yates offer pace and craft \n",

        "summary": "How Charlton Athletic and PL programme helped a mother of two back to teaching with confidence",
        "text": "\n As part of the Premier League  celebrating five years of Premier League Primary Stars , clubs running the school programme have nominated a \"Superstar\" - a young person or teacher who has inspired others through their dedication to the scheme, enthusiasm and own personal development. \n Stephanie (Charlton Athletic) \n Returning to work after maternity leave is a daunting prospect for many women, including Stephanie Baker, a primary school teacher and a mother of two. \n The anxieties about self-worth, staff changes, possible new responsibilities and duties are among issues that can be a real concern for teachers returning from a long absence. \n Steph's smooth transition back to her role as PE Lead at Alderwood Primary School in Eltham, southeast London, was helped by Premier League Primary Stars and  Charlton Athletic Community Trust 's (CACT) Premier League Programme Officer, Anthony Quarm. \n \"I had just come back from maternity leave, and for anyone who has worked from home with two children for seven years, your confidence level is not brilliant,\" says Steph. \"Anthony provided me with that level of confidence.\" \n Exceptional progress \n Any worries Steph had were swiftly eased by her exceptional personal progress and as well as delivering PE she is a part of CACT's project to create a PE working group to support other teachers. \n Anthony has seen Steph's confidence develop and the positive impact that has had on her students. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"I'm very proud of the work Steph is doing,\" says Anthony, \"It's brilliant to see how the children are responding - laughing and also taking part. \n \"We offer our support to teachers. A lot of the impact we do, we hope will build a lifelong love of PE and sport for young kids. \n \"In areas of high deprivation where young people may not have such access to certain activities, we are able to provide that. The impact we have seen through this programme is absolutely extensive.\" \n Making a difference \n Steph's outstanding work via Premier League Primary Stars and CACT has been recognised with her Superstar award, an honour which has made her even more determined to continue making a difference. \n \"To be named as Premier League Superstar is a very humbling experience,\" she says. \"It's lovely to be recognised and will keep me driving our enthusiasm at the school and to keep those links going with the Premier League.\" \n \"[PL Primary Stars] knocks down all kinds of boundaries. There is the capacity for huge issues within our society to be changed. We are pushing against racism, we are pushing for gender equality. \n \"If we bring sport into the conversations we have within school, through sport so much can be changed.\" \n About PL Primary Stars \n CACT have been engaging with Premier League Primary Stars since the very start of the programme, while Charlton are one of 105 professional football clubs from across the leagues working in partnership with the Premier League. \n PL Primary Stars provides teachers and parents with free downloadable resources across a range of curriculum subjects at Key Stage 1 (ages 5-7 years) and Key Stage 2 (ages 7-11 years). \n \"The funding that is provided by the Premier League is absolutely crucial,\" adds Katie Cutajar, Headteacher, Alderwood Primary School. \n \"It really will have a lifelong impact and change for our children.\"  \n The resources, which are free, have been developed for teachers by teachers, and in collaboration with experts such as the  National Literacy Trust  and the  PSHE Association . \n Visit  PLPrimaryStars.com   for more information. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Premier League celebrates five years of PL Primary Stars Part 2:  William's story (Leicester City) Part 3:  Harry's story (Forest Green Rovers) Part 5:  Faizan's story (Burnley) Part 6:  Godolphin Academy's story Part 7:  Freya's story (Newport County) Part 8:  Delia's story (Everton) \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout looks at the  Fantasy Premier League  potential of the summer signings ahead of the 2022/23 season. \n Fabio Vieira (ARS) £6.0m \n The signing of the 22-year-old boosts  Arsenal ’s options in attack as they prepare for a busier 2022/23 under Mikel Arteta. \n The versatile Vieira arrives on the back of six goals and a league-high 14 assists in 27 appearances for Porto last term. \n \n \n \n \n \n CRY \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 2 \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 2 \n \n LEI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n BOU \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 3 \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n Although best suited to a No 8 role in a 4-3-3 formation, the Portuguese can also play in all three attacking-midfield positions in a 4-2-3-1.  \n Having qualified for the UEFA Europa League, Arsenal's young attacking players could be more prone to rotation in the league this season.  \n Like Vieira, his new team-mates Bukayo Saka, Emile Smith Rowe, Gabriel Martinelli and Martin Odegaard are all under 24 and are largely unaccustomed to such a schedule, having missed out on Europe last season.  \n Crucially, though, Premier League managers are able to make five substitutions in a fixture this coming season, allowing managers more opportunities to freshen up their attackers late on in matches. \n Initially, at least, it could be that Vieira’s versatility is likely to earn him minutes off the bench, giving Fantasy managers time to assess the impact of rotation on Arteta's line-ups. \n Ivan Perisic (TOT) £5.5m \n Perisic's position in 2022/23 Fantasy will ultimately determine his appeal.  \n The Croat arrives at  Tottenham Hotspur  on the back of eight Serie A goals and seven assists for Inter Milan last season. \n Although he has mainly played as a winger throughout his career, Perisic has been transformed into an attacking wing-back for Inter.  \n He played as a left-sided wing-back last term and is expected to occupy the same role at Spurs in Antonio Conte’s 3-4-3 formation. \n \n \n \n \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 1 \n \n SOU \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n CHE \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 2 \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n TOT \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 0 \n \n WOL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n If he is listed as a defender in Fantasy, Perisic could attract huge attention as he would also collect four points for each of his clean sheets. \n By contrast, the 33-year-old’s potential would be significantly reduced as a midfielder in Fantasy, as they earn just one point per clean sheet. \n Notably, Spurs were among the league’s best defences after Conte was appointed head coach in Gameweek 11 last term. \n They claimed 13 clean sheets from that point, the third-best record in the league. \n If listed as a defender, Perisic can emerge as a major all-round prospect this season, driving managers to invest more funds into their backlines. \n See:  The Scout's FPL new signings \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at key tactical elements of the three clubs joining the Premier League in 2022/23. \n AFC Bournemouth (BOU) \n AFC Bournemouth are an athletic, tactically astute side whom  Scott Parker  will set up to make difficult to beat on their Premier League return. \n \n \n \n \n \n BOU \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 0 \n \n AVL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n MCI \n \n \n \n \n 4 - 0 \n \n BOU \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n BOU \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 3 \n \n ARS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n The Cherries lost only eight times last season, fewer than any other Championship side, and boasted the competition's best defensive record, with 39 goals conceded from 46 matches. \n They are hard-working and well organised from front to back, letting in a paltry 24 goals in open play during 2021/22. \n Parker likes his side to press but always remains flexible enough to use other tactical plans, and is known for making adjustments to the formation over the course of a match. \n Switching systems \n In the early stages of 2021/22 Parker used a 4-3-3, but in the closing weeks he employed 4-2-3-1 more frequently. \n When using both systems, Parker would regularly switch to using a back three during matches. \n I sometimes feel Parker can overcomplicate matters, or focus too much on patterns of play, but his tactical flexibility is also a strength. \n Parker's formations 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Formations \n Amount \n \n \n \n \n 4-3-3 \n 27 \n \n \n 4-2-3-1 \n 13 \n \n \n 4-1-4-1 \n 2 \n \n \n 4-4-2 diamond \n 1 \n \n \n 4-4-2 \n 1 \n \n \n 4-1-3-2 \n 1 \n \n \n 3-5-2 \n 1 \n \n \n \n Premier League opponents are likely to find their space congested in contests against AFC Bournemouth. \n Known for their fitness and well-drilled shape under Parker, AFC Bournemouth's three units - defence, midfield and attack - all work hard to close down the opposition. \n Passes per defensive action (PPDA) is regarded as the best gauge of how well teams press, and the Cherries topped that department in last season's Championship. \n Their opponents averaged only 10.8 passes before Parker's men disrupted them with a defensive action. \n To make themselves competitive in the top flight, this high level of off-the-ball intensity must be maintained by AFC Bournemouth. \n Most PPDA in 21/22 Championship \n \n \n \n Team \n PPDA \n \n \n \n \n AFC Bournemouth \n 10.8 \n \n \n Fulham \n 11.5 \n \n \n West Brom \n 11.5 \n \n \n Sheffield Utd \n 11.7 \n \n \n Birmingham City \n 11.9 \n \n \n \n *Passes per defensive action It made them awkward opponents in the tougher tests last season - AFC Bournemouth won five and drew three of eight unbeaten encounters against teams who finished in the top five. \n Committing players in attack \n When Parker's men are on the front foot they like to operate with a fluid, energetic front five. \n In a 4-3-3 they will usually commit one full-back and a box-to-box central midfielder into advanced areas, which in effect transforms their shape to a 3-2-5. \n If two midfielders make a foray forward at once, the full-backs will tuck inside to supplement the shortfall in numbers in central midfield. \n The left-sided duo of  Jordan Zemura  and  Jaidon Anthony  provide skill and speed down that flank. \n Anthony's nutmeg and assist v Derby County \n \n \n Welcome to the  @JaidonnA11  nutmeg show 🥜 @HendyGroup  //  #afcb  🍒  pic.twitter.com/MureXB0Aam \n— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth)  March 13, 2022 \n \n Scotland winger  Ryan Christie  offers guile coming in off the right, while the towering  Philip Billing  delivers goals and assists via late runs into the box. \n Up front, 29-goal  Dominic Solanke  enjoyed the season of his life in 2021/22, improving his all-round display to become the Cherries' No 1 striker. \n Control across the pitch \n There is a healthy balance in the way AFC Bournemouth set about their work. \n They keep possession well, ranking fourth last term for the most successful passes in the opposition half. \n Yet they are also excellent on transitions, enjoying the third-most turnovers in the competition in 2021/22. \n Developing more of a counter-attacking approach will be key for AFC Bournemouth as they prepare to face a higher level of opponent. \n It will be tough, but with a largely young squad and bright head coach building up invaluable experience, the Cherries will expect to be competitive. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Fulham back with exciting attack Part 2:  Wilson to deliver for Fulham again Part 4:  Kelly and Billing key for Cherries Part 5:  Forest counters can cause problems Part 6:  Johnson and Yates offer pace and craft \n",

        "summary": "How Forest Green Rovers have helped an 11-year-old settle playground disputes",
        "text": "\n As part of the Premier League  celebrating five years of Premier League Primary Stars , clubs running the school programme have nominated a \"Superstar\" - a young person or teacher who has inspired others through their dedication to the scheme, enthusiasm and own personal development. \n Harry (Forest Green Rovers) \n The playground is the perfect place for youngsters to let off steam but disagreements can quickly arise, especially during a spirited game of football. \n One youngster who has been inspired by Forest Green Rovers Community's Premier League Primary Stars programme is 11-year-old Harry, who has introduced a unique way of settling squabbles. \n \"To help resolve any kinds of disputes that were occurring, Harry came up with the great idea of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors',\" says Rob Mant, programmes manager at Forest Green Rovers Community. \n Harry, a pupil at Rodmarton Primary School, explains: \"It's like a primary-school version of a VAR. It has made a huge difference to all the football players. When we just disagree, we go straight into 'Rock, Paper, Scissors.' \" \n \n \n \"Primary Stars has really helped me to go forward on to the next steps and try to achieve more things\" \n \n PL Primary Stars participant Harry \n \n \n \n Harry's desire to reduce conflict is symptomatic of his development since he became involved with Premier League Primary Stars. \n \"He's gained lots of confidence in his ability to work together with other children - adults as well,\" says Caroline Musty, headteacher at Rodmarton. \n Harry has also made progress in the classroom, making a \"phenomenal\" improvement with his reading, according to Mant. \n And through the school's Ambassador Programme, opportunities have opened up with Forest Green, last season's EFL League Two champions. \n \n \n Launched in 2017 and available to every primary school in England and Wales,  #PLPrimaryStars  uses the appeal of the  #PL  and professional football clubs to support pupils in the classroom, the playground and on the sports field 🙌 Why we're celebrating ➡️  https://t.co/xeiPawQBvI   pic.twitter.com/8qOzmKcsN0 \n— Premier League Communities (@PLCommunities)  June 20, 2022 \n \n Harry has volunteered to read the teamsheet out to the crowd before kick-off, and has led the club's Green Devil mascot around New Lawn Stadium in front of the fans. \n \"Primary Stars has really helped me to go forward on to the next steps and try to achieve more things,\" he says. \n About PL Primary Stars \n Forest Green Rovers are one of 105 professional football clubs from across the leagues that run Premier League Primary Stars sessions in local schools. \n It is the second year in which the club have been involved in the programme, which provides teachers and parents with free downloadable resources across a range of curriculum subjects at Key Stage 1 (age 5-7 years) and Key Stage 2 (age 7-11 years). \n The resources, which are free, have been developed for teachers by teachers, and in collaboration with experts such as the  National Literacy Trust  and the  PSHE Association . \n Visit  PLPrimaryStars.com   for more information. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Premier League celebrates five years of PL Primary Stars Part 2:  William's story (Leicester City) Part 4:  Stephanie's story (Charlton Athletic) Part 5:  Faizan's story (Burnley) Part 6:  Godolphin Academy's story Part 7:  Freya's story (Newport County) Part 8:  Delia's story (Everton) \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at key tactical elements of the three clubs joining the Premier League in 2022/23, with Harry Wilson tipped to bring the best out of Aleksandar Mitrovic at  Fulham . \n Harry Wilson \n Wilson has formed a productive partnership with Mitrovic. \n The Wales winger supplied 10 assists for the Serb last season, using his left foot to send in excellent deliveries from open play and set-pieces. \n It was the most successful combination between two players in the Championship. \n Most chances created in 2021/22  \n \n \n \n Player \n Team \n Total chances \n Chances from open play \n \n \n \n \n Wilson \n FUL \n 102 \n 80 \n \n \n Swift \n RDG \n 102 \n 64 \n \n \n Thomas \n HUD \n 97 \n 45 \n \n \n Wallace \n MIL \n 94 \n 61 \n \n \n Garner \n NFO \n 88 \n 42 \n \n \n \n Wilson made a total of 102 key passes, sharing top spot in the division with Reading's John Swift. \n Coventry City’s Callum O’Hare (86) was the only player to carve out more chances in open play than Wilson. \n It is expected that Wilson will line up on the right of an attacking midfield trio, cutting inside to cause problems. \n He is not a prolific crosser, aiming 80 open-play crosses into the area last season, compared with 94 shots attempted. \n For this reason, he can also be deployed in a roaming No 10 role. \n Wilson's returns by season \n \n \n \n Season \n Club \n Goals \n Assists \n Division \n \n \n \n \n 17/18 \n HUL \n 7 \n 3 \n Champ \n \n \n 18/19 \n DER \n 16 \n 4 \n Champ \n \n \n 19/20 \n BOU \n 7 \n 0 \n PL \n \n \n 20/21 \n CAR \n 7 \n 11 \n Champ \n \n \n 21/22 \n FUL \n 10 \n 19 \n Champ \n \n \n \n Wilson enjoyed the season of his career so far in 2021/22. \n Making Craven Cottage his permanent home after a successful spell on loan from  Liverpool , he stepped up and delivered in Fulham's title-winning campaign. \n His 29 direct goal involvements comfortably bettered his previous best of 20, under  Frank Lampard  while on loan at Derby County. \n Wilson did score seven goals in his only Premier League season to date, excelling during a spell for  Eddie Howe ’s  AFC Bournemouth  in 2019/20, and he will target even more than that on his return. \n If Wilson and Mitrovic can combine in similar fashion on the Premier League stage, it will significantly boost Fulham's hopes of a longer stay in the competition. \n Aleksandar Mitrovic (FUL) \n Mitrovic smashed the Championship goalscoring record with 43 goals last season. \n The 27-year-old was under-used by  Scott Parker  in 2020/21, starting just 13 Premier League matches and scoring only three times during a frustrating relegation campaign. \n Rejuvenated under  Marco Silva , Mitrovic returns to the top flight brimming with confidence and, fitness permitting, he will be a more prominent figure this time around. \n Type of goals \n \n \n \n Option \n Goals \n Area \n Goals \n \n \n \n \n Right foot \n 22 \n Inside \n 43 \n \n \n Left foot \n 9 \n Outside \n 0 \n \n \n Header \n 12 \n   \n \n \n \n Every goal he scored last term came from inside the 18-yard box. \n Fulham’s dominance of possession and territory helped their most creative players supply the striker with terrific service. \n By frequently putting the ball into the area, Mitrovic used his physical strength and finishing prowess quite brilliantly to bully opposition defenders. \n Most headed shots 2021/22  \n \n \n \n Player \n Shots \n \n \n \n \n Aleksandar Mitrovic \n 74 \n \n \n Jake Cooper \n 35 \n \n \n Dominic Solanke \n 32 \n \n \n Kyle Bartley \n 31 \n \n \n \n His 12 headed goals were seven more than any other player in the Championship, but he also displayed real quality with both feet when opportunities arrived. \n Mitrovic's 26.54 per cent conversion rate highlighted his clinical finishing. \n The big issue facing Fulham and Mitrovic next season, will be their ability to get into those advanced positions on a regular basis. \n If they struggle to have possession in advanced areas, his impact could be affected. \n Passes in opposition half \n \n \n \n Forward \n Succ. passes \n \n \n \n \n Aleksandar Mitrovic \n 542 \n \n \n Chris Martin \n 533 \n \n \n Viktor Gyokeres \n 501 \n \n \n Joel Piroe \n 449 \n \n \n Brennan Johnson \n 425 \n \n \n \n Mitrovic's hold-up play will be integral to Fulham’s hopes of progressing higher up. \n No other Championship striker made a greater number of successful passes inside the opposition half last season. \n Silva's side rely heavily on the Serbia striker, who has recorded 24 Premier League goals for Fulham and former club  Newcastle United , at a rate of one every 286.6 minutes. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Fulham back with exciting attack Part 3:  Parker has the tools to succeed Part 4:  Kelly and Billing key for Cherries Part 5:  Forest counters can cause problems Part 6:  Johnson and Yates offer pace and craft \n",

        "text": "\n The Premier League is celebrating five years of its schools' programme  Premier League Primary Stars . \n Launched in 2017 and available to every primary school in England and Wales, Premier League Primary Stars uses the appeal of the Premier League and professional football clubs to support pupils in the classroom, the playground and on the sports field. \n To celebrate, clubs have nominated a \"Superstar\" - a young person or teacher who has inspired others through their dedication to the programme, enthusiasm and own personal development. \n \n \n \"Clubs do fantastic work to support children’s learning and we are very proud this national education programme now engages more than 18,500 primary schools in England and Wales\" \n \n Richard Masters, Premier League Chief Executive \n \n \n \n Each \"Superstar\" will receive a Nike Strike football, thanks to Premier League partner Nike, and a framed, limited-edition five-year anniversary illustration, created by graphic designer and digital illustrator Zem Clarke. \n \"We launched Premier League Primary Stars five years ago to support teachers and use the power and popularity of football to inspire children in the classroom and on the sports field,\" said Premier League Chief Executive Richard Masters.   \"Clubs do fantastic work to support children’s learning and we are very proud that this national education programme now engages more than 18,500 primary schools in England and Wales. \n \"Congratulations to all those who have been recognised as a Premier League Primary Stars Superstar, as part of the five-year anniversary celebrations, and thank you to all those involved in the programme over the years.\" \n Teacher support \n Currently  105  professional football clubs from across the leagues run in-classroom Premier League Primary Stars sessions in local schools. \n More than  58,000  teachers have signed up to access free online national curriculum-linked resources. \n Premier League Primary Stars provides teachers and parents with free downloadable resources across a range of curriculum subjects at Key Stage 1 (ages 5-7) and Key Stage 2 (ages 7-11), developed by teachers for teachers, and in collaboration with experts such as the  National Literacy Trust  and the  PSHE Association . \n Clubs provide in-school support to teachers, delivering educational sessions to schools in their communities. \n \n \n \"It is important to measure progress, but it is also important to see our pupils expand their thinking and learn about key subjects in a fun and engaging way\" \n \n Natalie Sutton, school manager at Sandfield Close Primary \n \n \n \n \"The Premier League Primary Stars programme has opened up so many opportunities and doors to us that we wouldn't have been able to open on our own,\" said Natalie Sutton, school manager at Sandfield Close Primary. \n \"We've had such a positive experience since joining back in 2018. It is important to measure progress but, for me, it is also important to see our pupils expand their thinking and learn about key subjects in a fun and engaging way. \n \"It has all been so positive for us as teachers, but more importantly beneficial to the learning of our pupils.\" \n Community investment \n The Premier League funds Premier League Primary Stars and other community programmes through its £100million investment per season in community facilities and community and education programmes. \n This is the biggest voluntary contribution to communities and other good causes of any football league in the world. \n Visit  PLPrimaryStars.com   for more information. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  William's story (Leicester City) Part 3:  Harry's story (Forest Green Rovers) Part 4:  Stephanie's story (Charlton Athletic) Part 5:  Faizan's story (Burnley) Part 6:  Godolphin Academy's story Part 7:  Freya's story (Newport County) Part 8:  Delia's story (Everton) \n",

        "text": "\n As part of the Premier League  celebrating five years of Premier League Primary Stars , clubs running the school programme have nominated a \"Superstar\" - a young person or teacher who has inspired others through their dedication to the scheme, enthusiasm and own personal development. \n William (Leicester City) \n Football can be a great way for youngsters to express themselves on the pitch, but for Year 6 student William, it has finally given him a voice that he longed for off the field. \n A pupil at  Alderman Richard Hallam Primary School , William has selective mutism and in his early school days would often communicate by clapping his hands or pointing to get attention from teachers and classmates. \n Now, after five years as a participant of the Premier League Primary Stars programme with  Leicester City in the Community  (LCitC), he can string full sentences together, have conversations with others and participate in full PE lessons. \n His progress has been nothing short of sensational. \n \n \n \"Leicester City have helped me grow my confidence and make friends along the way\" \n \n PL Primary Stars participant William \n \n \n \n \"We very quickly identified through his support staff that he [William] had a love of football and of sport in general,\" says Tom Twigg, football development coach at Leicester in the Community. \n \"It became a vehicle to allow him to develop those communication skills within school.\" \n For William, the opportunity to work one-to-one with LCitC and his class teacher has been a hugely positive experience. \n \"As soon as I started work with  Leicester City , they have helped me make new friends and to talk to them more,\" says William. \n Lynn Hollowood, a special education needs and disability teaching assistant, has watched William's development with delight. \n \"I'd go into class and the only time I saw him with a smile on his face was when he got a football,\" says Lynn. \"He was playing football with the older ones and the clapping then slowly went away, and then one day he just started to speak. So actually, football gave him his voice.\" \n \n \n This week we are celebrating 5️⃣ years of 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗶𝗲𝗿 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗴𝘂𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘀 🎉 Here's how  #PLPrimaryStars  has made a difference to schoolchildren across England and Wales 👇  pic.twitter.com/FokYGKHogt \n— Leicester City in the Community (@LCFC_Community)  June 20, 2022 \n \n The work of Leicester City in the Community extends to engaging with 164 schools in their locality, delivering nearly 1,400 sessions to targeted groups. \n They have enthusiastically supported the Premier League Primary Stars programme, which works with 105 professional football clubs from across the leagues, running in-classroom sessions in local schools. \n Their PL Primary Stars work is not designed for the classroom only. William recently joined other participants to take part in the national  PL Primary Stars tournament  at Watford's Vicarage Road stadium. \n \"It was a great experience and a brilliant day....and I scored a goal!\" says William. \n \"Leicester City have helped me grow my confidence and make friends along the way. They mean everything to me.\" \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Premier League celebrates five years of Primary Stars Part 3:  Harry's story (Forest Green Rovers) Part 4:  Stephanie's story (Charlton Athletic) Part 5:  Faizan's story (Burnley) Part 6:  Godolphin Academy's story Part 7:  Freya's story (Newport County) Part 8:  Delia's story (Everton) \n",

        "text": "\n Adrian Clarke looks at key tactical elements of the three clubs joining the Premier League in 2022/23. \n Fulham \n Fulham return to the Premier League as an attack-minded and tactically stable team. \n Marco Silva ’s side proved too potent for their Championship opponents last season, scoring an astonishing 106 goals in 46 matches. \n Favouring a 4-2-3-1 formation in all but three matches, their tactical approach was built around creating a number of opportunities inside the final third. \n Fulham were fast-starters, taking the lead in 71.7 per cent of their fixtures. \n Top attacking stats in Championship \n \n \n \n Team \n Shots in box \n Team \n Conv. rate  \n \n \n \n \n FUL \n 504 \n FUL \n 18.9% \n \n \n WBA \n 445 \n NFO \n 17.9% \n \n \n COV \n 427 \n LUT \n 17.7% \n \n \n \n Led by their record-breaking 43-goal striker  Aleksandar Mitrovic , Fulham tormented defences in 2021/22. \n Wingers  Harry Wilson  and  Neeskens Kebano  chipped in with 29 and 16 direct goal involvements respectively, while  Fabio Carvalho  also netted eight times and created a further eight from the No 10 role. \n They will miss Carvalho's brilliance following the 19-year-old's transfer to  Liverpool  so Fulham will hope to replace his energy and guile this summer. \n Thanks to their relentless pursuit of goals, Fulham fashioned 504 shots from inside the box last season, averaging around 11 per match. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Replicating that in the Premier League will not be possible, so there will be a reliance on clinical finishing. \n No Championship team had a greater chance-conversion rate than Fulham's 18.9 per cent last season, so this is an area of strength. \n They will also focus heavily on producing opportunities from corners and wide free-kicks. They scored 17 goals from set-pieces in 2021/22, the third highest in the division. \n With Wilson’s wonderful left foot, expect plenty of chances created from dead-balls. \n Top passing stats in Championship \n \n \n \n Team \n Build-up attacks \n Team \n 10+ pass sequences \n \n \n \n \n FUL \n 172 \n SWA \n 725 \n \n \n SWA \n 120 \n FUL \n 645 \n \n \n SHU \n 107 \n BOU \n 451 \n \n \n BOU \n 84 \n QPR \n 434 \n \n \n QPR \n 74 \n SHU \n 414 \n \n \n \n One of Fulham’s key traits under Silva is pinning opponents back with controlled periods of possession. \n Comfortable and patient on the ball, they produced 52 more build-up attacks than any other Championship side last term, and were behind only Swansea City for overall possession. \n How much possession will they enjoy in the Premier League? \n \n \n \n \n \n FUL \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 2 \n \n LIV \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n WOL \n \n \n \n \n 0 - 0 \n \n FUL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n FUL \n \n \n \n \n 3 - 2 \n \n BRE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n As a gauge, during the 2020/21 season, Fulham ranked 11th, with 49.4 per cent of the ball under  Scott Parker . This was after averaging 61.6 per cent in the Championship promotion campaign that preceded it. \n Last season they averaged 60.7 per cent of possession, so Fulham will likely opt for a balanced approach once again, with 50 per cent an achievable target. \n With Mitrovic at his best when crosses are sent in, it is unlikely they will sit back and become counter-attacking specialists. \n High tempo \n Fulham's style is not one-dimensional under Silva, so they should cope well with the tactical adaptations required. \n He encourages possession play, but also favours high-tempo football that sees his players press with great energy. \n Fulham were very strong in this department last term, with only Coventry City winning the ball more. \n Most shots/goals after high turnovers 21/22 \n \n \n \n Team \n Shots \n Goals \n \n \n \n \n COV \n 71 \n 6 \n \n \n FUL \n 66 \n 9 \n \n \n BOU \n 59 \n 6 \n \n \n \n Fulham’s attacking prowess means they should carry a goal threat home and away in 2022/23. \n Their main concern could be how they cope defensively. \n Five Championship sides kept more clean sheets than Fulham last term, who on occasion looked vulnerable. \n In home defeats by Huddersfield Town,  Nottingham Forest , Sheffield United and Coventry, they struggled to deal with opponents who closed them down inside their own half. \n Having leaked 43 goals, almost one goal per match, Fulham may look to invest in several new defensive players. \n The Cottagers have plenty of talent and a clearly defined style. But they must still recruit well, especially at the back, if they are to avoid another relegation battle.   \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  Wilson to deliver for Fulham again Part 3:  Parker has the tools to succeed Part 4:  Kelly and Billing key for Cherries Part 5:  Forest counters can cause problems Part 6:  Johnson and Yates offer pace and craft \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout looks at the  Fantasy Premier League  prospects of the three promoted sides in defence and attack. \n Nottingham Forest \n Brennan Johnson  was the star performer for Championship playoff winners  Nottingham Forest  in 2021/22. \n The 21-year-old scored 18 goals and also supplied 10 assists, both team-leading totals for Steve Cooper’s side.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Although he can operate as a winger or support striker, Johnson mainly featured as a centre-forward after Cooper's arrival as manager in mid-September. His position in 2022/23 Fantasy is therefore expected to reflect that role. \n The underlying numbers further highlight the Wales international's huge influence on Forest's attack. \n His 94 shots and 68 shots in the box were both team-leading totals, while his 60 chances created ranked second. \n Johnson's playoff strike v Sheff Utd \n \n \n That man again 🏹  🌳🔴  #NFFC   pic.twitter.com/zQ2hxuBgYU \n— Nottingham Forest FC (@NFFC)  May 17, 2022 \n \n All-round improvement \n Fellow forward  Lewis Grabban  improved his output under the new head coach, claiming 10 goals and three assists in 25 appearances.  \n Cooper mainly preferred a 3-4-1-2 system, which lifted Forest’s defensive output in 2021/22.  \n Sixteen of their 17 clean sheets for the season came in his 38 matches at the helm, of which nine were at home and seven away. \n Forest goalkeeper  Brice Samba  was kept busy last term and his average of 31.5 minutes per save proved quicker than any promoted No 1. \n Centre-back  Scott McKenna  offers attacking potential, with two goals and three assists last term. \n However, Cooper’s transfer business over the summer will be vital in assessing the Forest defence. \n New-look backline \n Djed Spence and Max Lowe thrived as wing-backs in 2021/22 but both players were on loan and have since returned to their parent clubs.  \n Spence produced two goals and four assists in 41 outings, while Lowe combined one goal with four assists from 21 matches.  \n Replacing Philip Zinckernagel, another loanee, is also likely to be a top priority. Playing in an advanced central role behind the front two, he scored six goals and assisted a further seven. \n Ultimately, it is Johnson who looks the go-to pick for Forest, although Cooper’s new wing-backs will definitely be worth monitoring over a kind run of fixtures. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Robinson an all-round prospect Part 2:  Look to Mitrovic and Wilson for value Part 3:  Rely on Travers for save points Part 4:  Solanke can deliver value \n",

        "text": "\n After the release of the 2022/23 fixtures, The Scout picks out five forwards with promising early schedules who should be considered for opening  Fantasy Premier League  squads. \n Jamie Vardy (LEI) \n Leicester City ’s talisman enjoyed a prolific end to the previous campaign after returning from injury. \n Vardy scored five goals in his final four starts, claiming three double-figure hauls and 38 points. \n Vardy goal v Southampton \n \n \n Barnes with the surge 💪‍ Vardy does the rest 🔥 We loved this one from  #LeiSou  on Sunday 👏‍  pic.twitter.com/PFrSvOFQuZ \n— Leicester City (@LCFC)  May 24, 2022 \n \n Despite making just 20 starts last term, Vardy still delivered seven double-digit returns. \n That potential for huge scores could even make him a worthy captain early on, with Brendan Rodgers’ side hosting  Brentford  and  Southampton  in the first three Gameweeks. \n Harry Kane (TOT) \n The  Tottenham Hotspur  forward returned to his best form under Antonio Conte in 2021/22. \n After a slow start to the campaign, Kane amassed 167 points after the Italian was appointed head coach in Gameweek 11, a total bettered by only two other players in Fantasy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n He posed the greatest goal threat of any player over that time, with his 114 shots, 29 big chances and 43 shots on target all league-leading totals. \n Home encounters with Southampton and  Wolverhampton Wanderers  in the first four Gameweeks, as well as a trip to promoted  Nottingham Forest , make a strong case for Kane’s inclusion in early squads. \n Erling Haaland (MCI) \n Manchester City ’s new signing arrives on the back of 49 goals and 13 assists in 52 Bundesliga appearances for Borussia Dortmund in the last two seasons. \n The champions’ kind schedule gives Haaland the perfect opportunity to enjoy a strong start to his career in Fantasy. \n Man City are the only side to avoid all of last season’s top six in the first six Gameweeks, lifting the Norwegian’s potential as the go-to premium forward, and a major armband contender, from the outset. \n Ivan Toney (BRE) \n Brentford ’s front man has the schedule to continue his fine form from the latter stages of last season. \n The Bees face only one of last season’s top six in their first seven matches, at home to  Manchester United  in Gameweek 2. \n After a slow start to the previous campaign, Toney scored eight of his 12 goals last season from Gameweek 22 onwards.  \n His totals of 41 shots in the box and 12 big chances both placed among the top three forwards in Fantasy in that period. \n Brennan Johnson (NFO) \n The Nottingham Forest youngster was crucial to their successful return to the Premier League, scoring 18 goals and supplying 10 assists in 2021/22. \n Although he can operate as a winger or support striker, the 21-year-old is expected to be listed as a forward in Fantasy this season as he mainly played in that role under Forest’s new head coach Steve Cooper. \n The Wales international’s 94 shots and 68 shots in the box were both team-leading totals last term, while his 60 chances created ranked second. \n Meetings with  Newcastle United ,  Everton  and AFC Bournemouth in the opening six Gameweeks could lift Johnson’s appeal as an early source of value. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Pair up Salah and Haaland for captaincy Part 2:  Early schedule favours Cucurella Part 3:  Son among best early armband picks \n",

The Jamaica international has netted in two of their last four contests. \n Haaland seeks fast start \n This encounter will attract plenty of attention for the likely Premier League debut of new City signing  Erling Haaland . \n The striker arrives having scored 114 goals in 116 club appearances for Borussia Dortmund and RB Salzburg across the last four seasons. \n His power and pace will certainly add a new layer of penetration to City’s attack and West Ham will have to focus very hard to keep him at bay. \n Haaland also likes the opening day of a new campaign. \n He scored twice in a 5-2 win for Dortmund against Eintracht Frankfurt in his first start last term, having netted two goals the year before in his former club’s opening day 3-0 success against Borussia Monchengladbach. \n City will hope their new recruit can hit the ground running once more. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Will Crystal Palace cause more misery to Arsenal? \n",

        "text": "\n After the release of the 2022/23 fixtures, The Scout picks out five midfielders with promising early schedules who should be considered for opening  Fantasy Premier League  squads. \n Son Heung-min (TOT) \n The South Korean enjoyed his best-ever campaign in Fantasy last term, finishing second overall on 258 points. \n Son’s prospects were lifted by the arrival of Antonio Conte, as  Tottenham Hotspur ’s head coach in Gameweek 11.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n He amassed 201 points under the Italian, more than any other player in Fantasy during that period. \n Son's total of 11 double-figure returns was more than any other player last term and shows why he will be a popular armband pick in the opening stages of 2022/23. \n Spurs entertain  Southampton  and  Wolverhampton Wanderers  in the first four Gameweeks, as well as visiting promoted  Nottingham Forest . \n Mohamed Salah (LIV) \n Last season’s top-scoring player in Fantasy on 265 points, Salah has surpassed 230 points in each of his five campaigns with  Liverpool . \n The statistics show Salah was also the dominant player for goal threat in 2021/22. \n His 139 shots, 113 shots in the box, 37 big chances and 55 shots on target were all league-leading totals. \n FPL fixtures: Pair up Salah and Haaland for captaincy \n Liverpool’s kind early schedule means Salah is bound to be a key figure in opening squads. \n They face only one of last term’s top six sides in their opening seven matches, when they visit  Manchester United  in Gameweek 3. \n Kevin De Bruyne (MCI) \n Manchester City  also have a very kind run of opponents to open their title defence. \n Indeed, the champions are the only side to avoid all of last season’s top six in the first six Gameweeks. \n FPL new signings: De Bruyne prospects lifted by Haaland \n If managers opt for new forward Erling Haaland as their go-to Man City attacker early on, De Bruyne has all the makings of an outstanding differential. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n The Belgian averaged 7.6 points per start in 2021/22, second only to the 8.5 of Salah among regular starters. \n Bukayo Saka (ARS) \n The winger was  Arsenal ’s star performer in 2021/22 Fantasy, thanks to his all-round attacking output. \n Saka totalled a career-high 179 points, with his 11 goals and nine assists also team-leading totals. \n While that is bound to result in a price increase from last term’s initial £6.5m, the Gunners have the early schedule to merit investment.  \n They avoid all of last season’s top six in their first five fixtures, hosting  Leicester City ,  Fulham  and  Aston Villa , in addition to visiting promoted  AFC Bournemouth . \n Leandro Trossard (BHA) \n Brighton & Hove Albion’ s Belgian was among the standout players in the latter stages of last season. \n Trossard scored four of his eight goals for the campaign and supplied three of his four assists, in his final six outings. \n Indeed, his total of 54 points in his last six matches was second only to the 57 of Son among all players. \n Brighton's fixtures indicate they can be handy value picks for opening squads.  \n They face just one of last season’s top six sides in their first eight matches, away to Man Utd in Gameweek 1. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Pair up Salah and Haaland for captaincy Part 2:  Early schedule favours Cucurella Part 4:  Vardy can make fast start \n",

        "summary": "Five-time PL winner visits Wallsend Boys Club to unveil Premier League defibrillator",
        "text": "\n Michael Carrick returned to  Wallsend Boys Club  in his hometown Newcastle as a potential life-saving defibrillator device was fitted at the club's Kirkley Park pitch. \n The five-time Premier League winner had a procedure to correct an irregular heart rhythm while a  Manchester United  player in 2017 and he spoke of his support for the  Premier League Defibrillator Fund , which is making more than 2,000 automated external defibrillators (AED) available to grassroots football clubs and facilities in England and Wales. \n \"It can happen to anyone at any time, you can't plan for it,\"  Carrick  said. \"You can't put a price on someone's life.  \n \"For those that haven't applied, make it the first thing you do when you see this. We want that safety to be on-site. It's crucial. \n \"Hopefully the cabinet stays shut and doesn't ever need to be opened, but it is reassuring to know it is there in case of emergencies, and if it can save one life, then that is a brilliant thing.\" \n Wallsend Boys Club has existed since 1904 and hosts 38 representative teams, with players ranging from four years old to 84 in the local community. \n Carrick, whose  Foundation  helps to fund to Wallsend, was joined by his brother Graeme and father Vince, as well as more than 20 male and female walking footballers to participate in a match at the facility. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The participants then all joined a CPR workshop, led by  Newcastle United  club doctor Paul Catterson. \n \"Unfortunately, more than 30,000 people suffer cardiac arrests outside of hospitals each year and the sad fact is only one in 10 survive,\" Catterson said. \n \"But ensuring access to defibrillators and learning CPR can help to increase survival rates. These modern devices give simple instructions aloud to the user so if you can use a smartphone, you can use one.\" \n Wallsend's rich history \n Wallsend has produced more than 90 professionals, including Premier League players such as  Alan Shearer ,  Steve Bruce  and  Lee Clark . \n A £560,000 grant from the  Football Foundation , which is funded by the Premier League, The FA and Government (via Sport England), helped to finance the construction of a floodlit pitch in 2018. \n \"Wallsend Boys Club plays a vital role in our community keeping people active and bringing them together,\" said chairman Steve Dale. \"Having a fixed defibrillator on-site means we can do that with increased safety. \n \"Our thanks to the Premier League and Michael Carrick Foundation for their continued support in helping us to provide access to football for thousands of local people.\" \n How clubs can apply \n Grassroots clubs who own their facilities and want to apply for a defibrillator should head to the Football Foundation website and use  this form  to check their eligibility for an AED. \n If eligible, clubs can  place their order . \n While defibrillators are designed to be simple to use, each grant recipient must have at least one person successfully complete The FA Education’s free online Sudden Cardiac Arrest course.  \n The Premier League is working with partners at The FA and Sport England to ensure facility developments, funded by the Football Foundation, incorporate this equipment in the future. \n",

        "text": "\n After the release of the 2022/23 fixtures, The Scout picks out five defenders with promising early schedules who should be considered for opening  Fantasy Premier League  squads. \n Marc Cucurella (BHA) \n Brighton & Hove Albion’ s wing-back offers many routes to returns over a very kind opening run of opponents. \n The Seagulls face just one of last season's top-six sides in their first eight matches, away to  Manchester United  in Gameweek 1. \n Cucurella combined a goal and an assist with 11 clean sheets and 21 bonus over his 35 appearances last term, his total of 126 points at least 31 more than any defensive team-mate. \n The underlying numbers further highlight his creative potential. \n From the point of his debut in Gameweek 4, Cucurella's 42 key passes were bettered by only four other defenders in Fantasy. \n Trent Alexander-Arnold (LIV) \n Last season's top-scoring defender has the schedule to immediately reward investors. \n Liverpool  face just one of the top six sides from 2021/22 in their opening seven matches, away to Man Utd in Gameweek 3. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n That gives Alexander-Arnold the chance to find the form that produced two goals, 12 assists, 18 clean sheets and 32 bonus in the previous campaign. \n His ability to deliver huge hauls in Fantasy will make him a key figure in many managers' backlines, his eight double-figure hauls at least two more than any other defender in Fantasy last term. \n Joao Cancelo (MCI) \n Manchester City 's kind run of opponents looks encouraging for the Portuguese to get off to another fast start.  \n The champions are the only side to avoid all of last season's top six in their first six fixtures.  \n Cancelo was the top-scoring defender in the opening six Gameweeks last term, amassing 44 points thanks to two assists and five clean sheets. \n That set the tone for the campaign, with the 28-year-old ending as the fifth top-scoring player overall on 201 points.  \n Cancelo's total of 81 shots was at least 30 more than any other defender in 2021/22, also bettering all of his Man City team-mates. \n Jonny (WOL) \n The wing-back could emerge as the best route into a  Wolverhampton Wanderers  defence that claimed 11 clean sheets last term. \n Jonny also impressed in attack after returning from long-term injury, scoring twice in 10 starts. \n Bruno Lage's men have three favourable home matches with  Fulham ,  Newcastle United  and  Southampton  in the opening six Gameweeks, as well as trips to  Leeds United  and  AFC Bournemouth . \n Ben Chilwell (CHE) \n Chelsea 's left wing-back made a huge impression at both ends of the pitch last term, before being sidelined through injury. \n Chilwell amassed 54 points in a run of six starts, combining three goals and an assist with four clean sheets. \n That all-round potential could make him the go-to Blues defender in 2022/23 Fantasy, particularly if Reece James continues to be used as a centre-back on occasion.  \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Pair up Salah and Haaland for captaincy Part 3:  Son among best early armband picks Part 4:  Vardy can make fast start \n",

Like in the reverse fixture, it's the away side that tends to fare better in his match-up, with City emerging victorious on four of their last six trips.  \n The  return meeting  between  Liverpool  and Everton is on 11 February, with the Toffees' only Anfield victory since 1999 coming in February 2021 when they  recorded a 2-0 success . \n South-coast derby is back \n AFC Bournemouth 's return to the Premier League means they will renew their rivalry with  Southampton . \n The Cherries  host Ralph Hasenhuttl's side  on Tuesday 18 October before the  return fixture  takes place at St Mary's Stadium on 26 April 2023. \n Interestingly, the home side have won only one of the last nine meetings in all competitions.  \n Download all 380 fixtures to your mobile device \n",

        "text": "\n From the start of the 2022/23 season, Premier League 2 will become an under-21 competition. \n The amendment to the age limit, which was previously under-23, has been introduced as part of an ongoing review of the  Elite Player Performance Plan  (EPPP) to better align with the EFL Trophy and international competitions. \n The rule change is designed to reflect the reality of the players in the competition, whose average is currently 19.  \n Clubs will, however, be permitted to use five (previously three) over-age outfield players and one over-age goalkeeper, in order to transition from its under-23 format.  \n The aim is to continue providing opportunities for the best young players to play alongside and against older and more experienced players. \n Premier League 2 is part of a suite of competitions that aims to best prepare players to make the transition to senior football.  \n This includes a variety of domestic cup competitions, matches involving senior opposition, such as through the EFL Trophy, and competitions against international peers which will return this season in expanded formats, following the Covid-19 pandemic.  \n Premier League 2, which for the last two seasons has been won by  Manchester City , continues to focus on technicality, physicality and intensity to bring players as close to first-team experience as possible. \n The League is continually monitoring all elements of the academy system and making refinements accordingly.  \n Consultation is ongoing with clubs as part of a wider review of the Professional Development Phase Games Programme which will continue through the season. \n See:  Premier League 2: Competition format explained \n",

        "text": "\n The 2022/23 Premier League season kicks off in 50 days with a London derby for the second year in a row as  Crystal Palace  host  Arsenal  at 20:00 BST on Friday 5 August, while defending champions  Manchester City  have been handed another tough start to their title defence. \n See:  Premier League 2022/23 fixtures released \n Arsenal opened 2021/22 with a short trip across the capital to promoted  Brentford  and were handed a  2-0 defeat , one of three consecutive losses they suffered to start the season.  Patrick Vieira 's Palace  beat Arsenal 3-0  when they met at Selhurst Park in April, and have lost only once in their last eight encounters with the Gunners. \n Hammer time for Haaland \n Man City must negotiate a challenging trip to  West Ham United  that will be televised live on Sky Sports in the UK on Sunday at 16:30 BST. \n Opening-weekend matches in London hold mixed memories for  Pep Guardiola .  Tottenham Hotspur  handed Man City a  1-0 defeat  last season, while in 2019/20, Guardiola's team  crushed West Ham 5-0  at the London Stadium. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n In their most recent meeting, on 15 May, West Ham gave Man City a big shock, going 2-0 up at half-time before the champions recovered to  draw 2-2  and get their title bid back on track. Guardiola will be hoping the addition of the prolific striker Erling Haaland will bring a more positive start.  \n Another Liverpool goal fest? \n It seems goals are guaranteed in the 12:30 BST kick-off on Saturday (live on BT Sport in the UK) as  Liverpool  have been drawn against  Fulham . \n Jurgen Klopp  will open a campaign against a promoted team for the fourth season running and their past three meetings against Watford,  Leeds United  and Norwich City respectively have averaged more than five goals. This might be music to the ears of new Liverpool forward Darwin Nunez, who scored 26 goals in 28 matches for Benfica last season.  \n Newcastle test for Forest  \n Nottingham Forest  will end their 23-year exile from the Premier League with a trip to  Newcastle United . Forest have one of the best opening-weekend records in Premier League history, but face a Magpies side who were resurgent under  Eddie Howe  in the second half of the season. \n AFC Bournemouth , the other promoted team, will host  Aston Villa  in what is a repeat of the Cherries'  first Premier League fixture . \n Everton 's home tie with  Chelsea , which kicks off at 17:30 BST on Saturday, will bring happy memories for Toffees manager  Frank Lampard . A  1-0 win in May at Goodison , against the club where he is a legend, helped Lampard to steer Everton out of the relegation zone. \n In the other live televised match in the UK,  Erik ten Hag  starts life as  Manchester United  manager at Old Trafford against  Brighton & Hove Albion  in the Sunday 14:00 BST fixture. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Boxing Day derbies galore \n The importance of the Boxing Day fixtures are even greater this season, as they will be the first after the 2022 FIFA World Cup final on Sunday 18 December 2022.     Special arrangements have been made to allow more time between matches played across the three festive match rounds giving squads greater time to recover. Previously, clubs were given a minimum of 48 hours between matches.    Boxing Day fixtures will be played on 26 and 27 December, with the following Matchweek played across 29-31 December. The New Year match round will be played on 2-5 January.  \n This year's Boxing Day schedule will feature three London derbies as well as a south-coast meeting for  Southampton  and Brighton. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n More final-day thrills? \n After a thrilling 2021/22 season where so much was decided on the final round of fixtures, the eyes of fans, players and managers soon turn to their Matchweek 38 opponents, on 28 May, 2023. \n The two main title rivals for the past four seasons are both away from home. Man City travel to Brentford, while Liverpool are at Southampton. \n Will they take their battle to lift the Premier League Trophy down to the wire like last season? Or will another team emerge from chasing pack to break their dominance? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Get the 2022/23 fixtures by downloading the Premier League's digital calendar \n",

        "text": "\n The release of the 2022/23 fixture list suggests Erling Haaland and Mohamed Salah will be very popular early picks in  Fantasy Premier League . \n Manchester City’ s new signing Haaland arrives on the back of 49 goals and 13 assists in 52 Bundesliga appearances for Borussia Dortmund over the last two seasons. \n See:  Haaland can shake up 2022/23 Fantasy \n And the champions’ opening run of opponents hands him the chance to immediately make an impact. \n They are the only side to avoid all of the top six from 2021/22 in the opening six Gameweeks. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Liverpool , meanwhile, play just one of last term's top six in their first seven matches, visiting  Manchester United  in Gameweek 3. \n As the go-to captain for millions of managers each Gameweek in 2021/22, Salah is bound to be a key target for initial squads. \n By pairing the Egyptian with Haaland as their big-hitters, managers would have a captain who faces a promoted side in four of the first five Gameweeks. \n Salah and Haaland captaincy rotation \n \n \n \n GW \n Captain \n Fixture \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n Salah \n FUL (A) \n \n \n 2 \n Haaland \n BOU (H) \n \n \n 3 \n Haaland \n NEW (A) \n \n \n 4 \n Salah \n BOU (H) \n \n \n 5 \n Haaland \n NFO (H) \n \n \n \n As Haaland and Salah are expected to be the main targets, Kevin De Bruyne and Darwin Nunez could prove strong differentials. \n Man City’s De Bruyne enjoyed an outstanding second half of 2021/22, after injury restricted him to only five starts in the first 16 Gameweeks. \n His total of 165 points from Gameweek 17 onwards placed second only to the 177 of  Tottenham Hotspur 's Son Heung-min among all players.  \n Liverpool’s new forward Nunez, meanwhile, produced 26 goals and four assists in 28 league appearances for Benfica last term. \n See:  Nunez can force Liverpool rethink \n Double up with the defences \n Early investment in the Man City and Liverpool defences also looks likely to reward managers. \n They supplied all of the six top-scoring players in that position in the previous campaign, with Trent Alexander-Arnold and Joao Cancelo the top performers thanks to their multiple routes to returns. \n Cancelo's 2021/22 best bits \n \n \n The very best of our flying Portuguese full-back! 🇵🇹💫 #ManCity   pic.twitter.com/PfXaHbET3Z \n— Manchester City (@ManCity)  June 7, 2022 \n \n Indeed, they were the third and fifth top-scoring players in 2021/22 Fantasy, totalling 208 and 201 points respectively. \n With Liverpool and Man City offering such strong options at both ends of the pitch from the outset, finding value picks elsewhere looks essential for opening squads. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  Early schedule favours Cucurella Part 3:  Son among best early armband picks Part 4:  Vardy can make fast start \n",

        "text": "\n The Premier League's Boxing Day matches will be even more eagerly anticipated than usual this season and for  Nottingham Forest  fans in particular 26 December will mark the end of a 24-year wait. \n See:  All 380 Premier League fixtures released \n Eight days after the 2022 FIFA World Cup final in Qatar, and following a six-week hiatus, the Premier League will return with added significance for Forest, who can look forward to an exciting trip to Old Trafford following the release of the fixtures for the 2022/23 season. \n The last time Forest visited  Manchester United  in the competition came on the very same day, back in 1998, when they  lost 3-0 to Sir Alex Ferguson's side . \n London derby day \n This Boxing Day, there are also three London derbies, including  Arsenal v West Ham United  and  Brentford v Tottenham Hotspur , a south-coast meeting between  Southampton and Brighton & Hove Albion  and a renewal of acquaintances as  Steven Gerrard 's  Aston Villa host Liverpool . \n Arsenal  aim to continue their strong run of home form against  West Ham , whom they have beaten in their last six fixtures at Emirates Stadium,  Brentford  will target taking points off  Spurs  after holding them to a draw last time out, while  Fulham  will seek their first win over  Crystal Palace  since 2013, when they meet at Selhust Park. \n Gerrard will look to go one better against  Liverpool , after narrowly  losing this fixture 2-1  to his former club last season, having watched his side take the lead early on. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Manchester City  will do well to improve on the 11 goals they produced in their two fixtures against  Leeds United  last season, but the champions will be hoping for a repeat of their  4-0 win at Elland Road  now that they have Erling Haaland spearheading their attack. \n Leicester City  also put four unanswered goals past  Newcastle United  last term, but could find it tough to repeat that scoreline given the transformation that has taken place under new head coach  Eddie Howe . \n Elsewhere,  Chelsea  will aim to avoid a repeat of their last encounter with  AFC Bournemouth  at Stamford Bridge, when  Dan Gosling  netted the winner in December 2019, while  Wolverhampton Wanderers  will be seeking back-to-back victories at  Everton . \n Festive twist \n The festive period will not be quite as frenetic as usual, as special arrangements have been been made to allow more time between matches played across the three match rounds. This will allow squads greater time to recover. \n Previously clubs were given a minimum of 48 hours between matches.    So, after the Boxing Day round of fixtures have been played on 26 and 27 December, the following matchweek will be played across 29, 30 and 31 December. \n The New Year matchweek, when  Chelsea host Manchester City , will be played on 2, 3, 4 and 5 January. \n Download all the fixtures \n Remember, you can get all 380 fixtures sent directly to your mobile device by using the Premier League's digital calendar, which you can set up right now at pl.ecal.com . \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout looks at the  Fantasy Premier League  prospects of the three promoted sides in defence and attack. \n AFC Bournemouth \n Dominic Solanke  has the potential to become a major source of value in Fantasy this season. \n The forward was a key figure in  AFC Bournemouth ’s immediate return to the Premier League, scoring 29 goals in 46 appearances. \n Having also supplied seven assists, he was involved in 48.6 per cent of the Cherries’ goals in 2021/22. \n All of Solanke's 2021/22 goals \n \n \n 3️⃣0️⃣ goals across the season 🔥🔥  Every. Single.  @DomSolanke . Strike. 🎬  pic.twitter.com/U6k5bWHNes \n— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth)  May 16, 2022 \n \n Playing as a lone striker in a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 formation, Solanke’s standing as AFC Bournemouth’s chief goal threat is obvious. \n His 164 shots were more than double any team-mate, while his 119 shots in the box were more than three times the total of any other Cherries player. \n Midfielder  Philip Billing  produced his best-ever campaign thanks to an advanced central role behind Solanke. \n The Dane scored 10 goals and supplied 10 assists over 40 outings for Scott Parker’s side. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Wingers  Jaidon Anthony  and  Ryan Christie  could, however, prove better options if Parker adopts a more cautious approach and uses Billing in a withdrawn role. \n Anthony was the more productive of the two wide men, delivering eight goals and seven assists, while Christie combined three goals with eight assists. \n The duo were the Cherries’ top creators, with Anthony leading the way by providing 71 key passes to the latter's 56. \n However, it was Christie who boasted the greater goal threat of the two, by 72 shots to 61. \n For now, though, AFC Bournemouth's midfield options are best monitored and Solanke’s far superior goal threat makes him their most appealing pick for 2022/23 fantasy. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Robinson an all-round prospect Part 2:  Look to Mitrovic and Wilson for value Part 3:  Rely on Travers for save points Part 5:  Johnson the star attraction for Forest \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout looks at the  Fantasy Premier League  potential of the summer signings ahead of the 2022/23 season. \n Darwin Nunez (LIV) £9.0m \n The signing of Nunez could force managers to revise how they invest in  Liverpool ’s key assets in 2022/23  Fantasy Premier League . \n Nunez arrives on the back of 26 goals and four assists in 28 league appearances for Benfica. \n He also impressed in the UEFA Champions League, scoring six goals in 10 outings, including strikes in both his matches against Liverpool. \n \n \n \n \n \n FUL \n \n \n \n \n 2 - 2 \n \n LIV \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n LIV \n \n \n \n \n 1 - 1 \n \n CRY \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n close \n \n \n TV Info \n \n Broadcasters \n \n \n \n \n \n The Uruguay international can operate as a lone striker or as part of a front two, allowing  Jurgen Klopp  the option of moving to 4-4-2 late in matches, a tactic he employed on occasion last season. \n He can also be utilised from the left flank, cutting inside on to his favoured right foot. \n Having played up front in the previous campaign, the 22-year-old is expected to occupy the lone striker role in a 4-3-3 formation. \n As a result, Nunez is listed as a forward in Fantasy.  \n Forward planning \n Along with  Manchester City ’s signing of Erling Haaland (£11.5m) and the form of Harry Kane (£11.5m) under Antonio Conte at  Tottenham Hotspur , the arrival of Nunez lends further weight to the tactic of investing in a big-hitting forward. \n Nunez also increases a host of strong Liverpool options in Fantasy. \n The Reds boasted the top-scoring goalkeeper last term, along with four of the top five defenders and three of the eight highest-scoring midfielders. \n Salah the top target again \n Mohamed Salah’s (£13.0m) consistency means he will remain the go-to attacker for millions of managers, as he produced 230+ points in each of his five seasons for Liverpool. \n Meanwhile, the form of full-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold (£7.5m) and Andrew Robertson (£7.0m) made a strong case for heavily backing their defence last term. \n If Nunez settles quickly, though, he could prove a big influence on how managers pick their quota of three Liverpool players in 2022/23. \n See:  The Scout's FPL new signings \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout looks at the  Fantasy Premier League  prospects of the three promoted sides in defence and attack. \n Fulham \n Aleksandar Mitrovic  enjoyed a record-breaking season for the 2021/22 Championship winners. \n The Serb scored 43 goals in 44 appearances to help seal  Fulham ’s immediate return to the Premier League. \n Marco Silva’s side were the first side in 20 years to score more than 100 goals in the Championship, netting 106 over their 46 matches.  \n And Mitrovic was involved in 47 per cent of those strikes, having also supplied seven assists.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n As the focal point of Silva’s 4-2-3-1 formation, Mitrovic boasted a huge goal threat last term.  \n His 198 shots and 138 attempts inside the penalty area were both more than any other player in the Championship. \n Indeed, both those totals were also over double any of his Fulham team-mates, which suggests the Serb will be a popular value pick for managers in 2022/23.  \n Look to Wilson for assists \n Harry Wilson ’s multiple routes to returns indicate he should not be overlooked. \n The winger scored 10 goals and supplied 19 assists over his 41 outings in the previous campaign. \n His all-round attacking threat is highlighted by the underlying statistics.  \n Wilson created 102 chances, more than any team-mate last term. In addition, his 94 shots and 52 efforts inside the box placed second and third respectively for Fulham.  \n Wilson assist for Mitrovic \n \n \n Aleksandar Mitrović scores goals. 🔥 🤍 4-0 🔵 |  #FULLUT   pic.twitter.com/wJviMfOZxU \n— Fulham Football Club (@FulhamFC)  May 9, 2022 \n \n Crucially, he also possesses a strong work-rate which is favoured by the  Bonus Points System  (BPS), which determines bonus points in each match. \n The Welshman also made 60 successful tackles, more than any other Cottagers’ player in 2021/22. \n Mitrovic’s goal threat ensures he will be the go-to Fulham attacker for many managers, while Wilson can be a strong differential thanks to his all-round potential for returns. \n Remember, you can find out who Fulham will face next season when the 2022/23 fixtures are released on premierleague.com this Thursday at 09:00 BST. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Robinson an all-round prospect Part 3:  Rely on Travers for save points Part 4:  Solanke can offer value Part 5:  Johnson the star attraction for Forest \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout looks at the  Fantasy Premier League  prospects of the three promoted sides in defence and attack. \n Fulham  \n Antonee Robinson  was  Fulham 's most productive defender in the Championship last season. \n The left-back recorded two goals and four assists across 36 appearances as the Cottagers sealed their immediate return to the Premier League. \n Despite missing 10 of his side’s matches, Robinson’s 41 chances created were more than any defensive team-mate, placing seventh for Marco Silva’s side. \n The US international also impressed in his ball-winning duties, his 47 successful tackles and 61 interceptions both second among Fulham players. \n These statistics are favoured by the  Bonus Points System  (BPS), boosting Robinson’s chances of earning bonus points whenever Fulham keep a clean sheet.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Centre-back  Tosin Adarabioyo  supplied two goals and two assists over his 41 outings. \n The 24-year-old boasts a strong aerial threat from free-kicks and corners for Silva’s side, with only six team-mates bettering his 27 shots last term. \n Indeed, in Fulham’s previous Premier League campaign in 2020/21, Adarabioyo’s total of 17 headed attempts from set-pieces ranked joint-fourth among all defenders in Fantasy. \n He can also collect bonus when the Cottagers’ keep out their opponents. \n The centre-back produced a team-leading 26 blocks, while his 50 interceptions placed third. \n Rodak the first-choice 'keeper \n Between the posts,  Marek Rodak  secured the goalkeeper position from mid-October, conceding just 26 goals in his 33 matches.  \n However, his average of 42.5 minutes per save was the slowest of all three promoted goalkeepers, which points to Robinson and Adarabioyo as the best options for those considering investment in the Fulham backline.  \n The Cottagers’ record of nine clean sheets at home and eight on the road suggests managers should look to start their defenders according to the fixture, rather than simply rotate on a home and away basis.  \n Remember, you can find out who Fulham will face next season when the 2022/23 fixtures are released on premierleague.com this Thursday at 09:00 BST. \n Also in this series \n Part 2:  Look to Mitrovic and Wilson for value Part 3:  Rely on Travers for save points Part 4:  Solanke can offer value Part 5:  Johnson the star attraction for Forest \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout looks at the  Fantasy Premier League  potential of the summer signings ahead of the 2022/23 season. \n Erling Haaland (MCI) £11.5m \n The arrival of Haaland at  Manchester City  will have a major impact on how Fantasy managers structure their squads in 2022/23. \n \n \n \n Haaland moves to the Etihad Stadium on the back of 49 goals and 13 assists in 52 Bundesliga appearances for Borussia Dortmund in the last two seasons. \n The forward has also proven his prowess in the UEFA Champions League, scoring 13 goals and supplying two assists in 11 appearances for Dortmund. \n Haaland’s signing can revive the interest in forwards in Fantasy, a position that frustrated managers in 2021/22. \n Harry Kane finished as the top-scoring forward on 192 points, despite managing just one goal and one assist in the first 15 Gameweeks. \n Cristiano Ronaldo, meanwhile, was runner-up to Kane among forwards, yet his 159 points placed only joint-18th overall. \n Midfielders offered big points \n By contrast, eight of the 14 top-scoring players in 2021/22 Fantasy were midfielders. \n Pairing Mohamed Salah with Son Heung-min or Kevin De Bruyne proved a very successful tactic in the second half of 2021/22. \n However, Haaland’s arrival could force a re-think in 2022/23, persuading many to distribute funds more evenly in attack by owning one premium midfielder and one premium forward. \n \n \n HE'S HERE! 💙  pic.twitter.com/JuZEtzTWbv \n— Manchester City (@ManCity)  June 13, 2022 \n \n Haaland’s signing indicates Pep Guardiola will mainly operate with a lone striker system next season, either in a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 set-up.  \n This is likely to increase the chances of rotation on the flanks, with Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, Riyad Mahrez, Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Jesus competing for minutes. \n Penalty taker duties? \n The underlying numbers give an indication of the kind of service Haaland can expect. \n Man City have ranked among the top two sides for big chances in each of Guardiola’s six seasons in charge. \n They have also been among the four top clubs for penalties awarded in five of those campaigns. \n Having scored 24 of his 26 spot-kicks for club and country over his career, there is a strong possibility Haaland will become their first-choice taker ahead of Mahrez.  \n Man City under Guardiola \n \n \n \n Season \n Big chances \n Rank \n Penalties \n Rank \n \n \n \n \n 2016/17 \n 101 \n 1 \n 9 \n =2 \n \n \n 2017/18 \n 129 \n 1 \n 8 \n 2 \n \n \n 2018/19 \n 125 \n 1 \n 4 \n =12 \n \n \n 2019/20 \n 141 \n 1 \n 11 \n 2 \n \n \n 2020/21 \n 107 \n 2 \n 9 \n =4 \n \n \n 2021/22 \n 123 \n 2 \n 9 \n =1 \n \n \n \n As the focal point of Man City’s attack, Haaland will be supplied with a multitude of scoring opportunities.  \n He has the potential to take 2022/23 Fantasy by storm, forcing managers to reassess their midfield plans in order to spend bigger up front.  \n Remember, you can find out who Haaland and his new team-mates will face next season when the 2022/23 fixtures are released on premierleague.com this Thursday at 09:00 BST. \n See:  The Scout's FPL new signings \n",

        "text": "\n The Scout assesses Kevin De Bruyne and how Erling Haaland's arrival at  Manchester City  could affect midfielder's assist output in  Fantasy Premier League . \n Kevin De Bruyne (MCI) £12.0m \n De Bruyne’s appeal as the go-to premium midfielder in 2022/23  Fantasy Premier League  will be boosted by the arrival of Erling Haaland at Man City. \n The midfielder enjoyed an outstanding second half of 2021/22, after injury restricted him to only five starts in the first 16 Gameweeks. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n De Bruyne's total of 165 points from Gameweek 17 onwards placed second only to the 177 of  Tottenham Hotspur 's Son Heung-min among all players.  \n The signing of Haaland, meanwhile, solves Pep Guardiola’s search for a centre-forward following the departure of Sergio Aguero at the end of 2019/20. \n \n \n \n See:  How Haaland will take Premier League by storm \n Guardiola is expected to change his formation in 2022/23, moving to the 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 headed by Aguero. \n That could be good news for De Bruyne’s prospects in Fantasy, who earned only eight assists last season, despite creating a team-high total of 87 chances. \n De Bruyne's creative output by season \n \n \n \n Season \n Assists \n Chances created \n Combined % \n \n \n \n \n 2016/17 \n 18 \n 103 \n 17.5% \n \n \n 2017/18 \n 16 \n 105 \n 15.2% \n \n \n 2019/20 \n 20 \n 136 \n 14.7% \n \n \n 2020/21 \n 12 \n 80 \n 15% \n \n \n 2021/22 \n 8 \n 87 \n 9.2% \n \n \n \n *18/19 11 starts through injury \n Indeed, only 9.2 per cent of the chances De Bruyne created led to goals in 2021/22, with Guardiola regularly using a “false 9” formation to compensate for the lack of a centre-forward. \n The Belgian's average dropped from 15.6 per cent across the playmaker’s previous four seasons as a regular for Guardiola. \n This suggests that De Bruyne’s range of passing, and the spaces he is able to occupy, can prove even more productive in a system where City play with a traditional forward. \n Certainly, Haaland’s clinical conversion rate also aids the Belgian’s potential. \n Haaland's goal record at Dortmund \n \n \n \n Season \n Goals \n Shots \n Conversion rate \n \n \n \n \n 2020/21 \n 27 \n 93 \n 29% \n \n \n 2021/22 \n 22 \n 8- \n 27.5% \n \n \n \n The 21-year-old scored with 28.3 per cent of his shots in his two Bundesliga campaigns with Borussia Dortmund. \n Indeed, that was more than double the 12.5 per cent of Gabriel Jesus, City’s only regular starting forward in Fantasy. \n Man City's top scorers in 2021/22 \n \n \n \n Team \n Goals \n Shots \n Conversion rate \n \n \n \n \n Kevin De Bruyne \n 15 \n 78 \n 19.2% \n \n \n Raheem Sterling \n 13 \n 57 \n 22% \n \n \n Riyad Mahrez \n 11 \n 61 \n 18% \n \n \n Phil Foden \n 9 \n 57 \n 15.8% \n \n \n Bernardo Silva \n 8 \n 47 \n 17% \n \n \n Ilkay Gundogan \n 8 \n 55 \n 14.5% \n \n \n Gabriel Jesus \n 8 \n 64 \n 12.5% \n \n \n \n Despite winning the title, City were without a reliable scorer, with De Bruyne among only three players who managed double-figures for goals in 2021/22. \n Haaland’s signing looks set to solve that problem for City, with chief creator De Bruyne now a major rival to   Liverpool's 2021/22 Playmaker of the Season winner Mohamed Salah  and Son as the best premium midfielder in Fantasy next season. \n Remember, you can find out who De Bruyne, Haaland and their City team-mates will face next season when the 2022/23 fixtures are released on premierleague.com this Thursday at 09:00 BST. \n See:  The Scout's FPL new signings \n",

        "text": "\n Education secretary Nadhim Zahawi has praised the work of the  Newcastle United Foundation  after a visit to its new home, NUCASTLE. \n \"I loved seeing the great work being done at Newcastle United Foundation,” said Zahawi. \n \"They are delivering education, health and wider support programmes to their local community, across all ages, to help with their learning, wellbeing or getting back into work.\" \n Through the NU Futures programme - an initiative that will support 12,000 young people over the next 10 years and transform the way the next generation enter the world of work - Zahawi was able to witness the outstanding efforts that are being conducted at NUCASTLE. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Just a five-minute walk from the club's stadium St. James' Park, NUCASTLE will give schoolchildren, teenagers and young adults access to up to 300 businesses across Newcastle, North Tyneside and Northumberland through the programme. \n The hub was built with a  £2million grant from the Football Foundation’s funding partners , the Premier League, The FA and the government through Sport England. \n Zahawi saw NUCASTLE's facilities for learning that included its dedicated STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) classroom and esports suite. More than 55 secondary schools from the region have been using the hub since its opening in March 2022. \n During his visit, Zahawi also met with former  Newcastle United  striker and Foundation Trustee, Shola Ameobi, Premier League Head of Corporate Affairs Tim Vine and MP for Hexham, Guy Opperman. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n While there are significant investors in NUCASTLE and NU Futures to fund these projects, ordinary fans can also contribute to the Foundation, such as bidding for shirts signed by first-team players, Chris Wood, Matt Targett and Kieran Trippier.  \n \n \n Our end of season eBay auction goes live at 8pm tonight with our 𝗝𝗮𝗻𝘂𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝗦𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗪𝗲𝗲𝗸 📲 Bid on exclusive 2021/22  #NUFC  kits donated by players including  @officialcwood ,  @mattytargett  and  @trippier2  to help fundraise for our community work 🖤🤍 \n— Newcastle United Foundation (@NU_Foundation)  June 5, 2022 \n \n",

        "text": "\n The new Premier League season is about to begin for millions of  Fantasy Premier League  managers across the world. \n Planning can now start after the 2022/23 fixtures were released on  premierleague.com . \n Study the schedule \n Assessing the fixtures was a vital part of 2021/22 FPL champion Jamie Pigott’s winning formula. \n \"From the beginning of the season, when making your first squad, take in all of the fixtures\", he says. \n \"It can be overwhelming but I think it's super valuable to look at the landscape, see how fixtures are going to play out.\" \n Key targets \n Gameweek 1 is often the most significant weekend of a campaign for Fantasy managers. \n The opening round of matches can offer insight into the key players to target for your squad. \n West Ham United  duo Michail Antonio and Said Benrahma immediately found their form in 2021/22. \n The Hammers played  Newcastle United ,  Leicester City  and  Crystal Palace  in the first three Gameweeks. \n Antonio and Benrahma score in GW1 \n \n \n The opening day of last season saw us take the points in a thriller at St. James' Park 💪 #PLFixtures   pic.twitter.com/TxOHJ7ulSc \n— West Ham United (@WestHam)  June 15, 2022 \n \n Antonio was the top-scoring player in Fantasy over that period, earning 40 points thanks to four goals and four assists. \n The forward started the season priced at £7.5m and was selected by 1.6million managers in Gameweek 1. \n By the time Gameweek 4 arrived, however, Antonio had climbed to £8.0m in price and was owned by over 4.2m.  \n Benrahma, meanwhile, produced two double-figure hauls in those opening three encounters, level with premium midfielders Mohamed Salah and Son Heung-min. \n By doubling up on Antonio and Benrahma, World No 2 Suvansh Singh enjoyed a strong start to 2021/22 Fantasy, the Indian manager never leaving the top 300,000 all season. \n Identifying trends \n The early success of Joao Cancelo also highlighted the potential of attacking full-backs in the previous campaign. \n Manchester City ’s Portuguese was the top-scoring defender in Fantasy over the first six Gameweeks, his 44 points placing third overall. \n He produced two assists and five clean sheets in that run, with a further six bonus highlighting his many routes to returns. \n Starting at £6.0m, Cancelo rose by a cost of £1.2m over the campaign, joint-top with  Tottenham Hotspur ’s Son.  \n The Premier League action may still be nearly two months away, but using the fixtures to plan ahead now can help build an early platform for success in 2022/23. \n Remember, you can  get the 2022/23 fixtures by downloading the Premier League's digital calendar . \n This allows FPL managers to sync the Gameweek deadlines to their devices. \n Next:  The Scout reacts to the 2022/23 fixtures \n",

Part 3:  Spurs wing-backs to be key targets Part 4:  De Bruyne and Son to challenge Salah's No 1 spot Part 5:  Guimaraes can flourish in first full season Part 7:  All-rounder Toney can push on \n",

Part 3:  Spurs wing-backs to be key targets Part 4:  De Bruyne and Son to challenge Salah's No 1 spot Part 6:  Premium forwards essential for 2022/23? Part 7:  All-rounder Toney can push on \n",
