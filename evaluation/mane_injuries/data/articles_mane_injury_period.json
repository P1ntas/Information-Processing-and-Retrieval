    "text": "\n A resurgent  Crystal Palace  have lifted themselves to 16th place in the Premier League, but face a tough test when  Arsenal visit on Monday . \n Adrian Clarke analyses the Eagles' upturn in form.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Zaha\u2019s productivity \n At the age of 24  Wilfried Zaha  is making his mark as a top-class Premier League performer. \n His electric pace and willingness to take on defenders has always marked him out as one of the most exciting players to watch, but a lack of consistent end-product has tarnished his reputation. \n The criticism was reasonable. Six Premier League goals and three assists over the previous three seasons was disappointing for someone of his talent.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Wilfried Zaha has improved his end-product this term, despite averaging fewer touches per match than in 2015/16\n             \n \n During 2016/17, we have witnessed a dramatic improvement. \n Boasting six goals and seven assists in this campaign alone, Zaha is producing enough to be considered Crystal Palace\u2019s most dangerous and reliable forward. \n Zaha's end-product \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n 2014/15 \n 2015/16 \n 2016/17 \n \n \n \n \n Mins/goal \n 495 \n 1,246 \n 389 \n \n \n Mins/assist \n 991 \n 2,492 \n 333.71 \n \n \n Touches \n 49.72 \n 51.43 \n 50.32 \n \n \n Dribbles completed \n 3.95 \n 4.59 \n 4.12 \n \n \n Shots \n 1.82 \n 1.16 \n 1.54 \n \n \n Chances created \n 0.64 \n 1.44 \n 1.12 \n \n \n \n What is interesting is that Zaha\u00a0is not seeing more of the ball, or having greater involvement inside the final third. \n He has perhaps been handed more freedom to break into central areas, but that alone is not the reason behind his upturn. \n Zaha\u2019s decision-making and improved technique has helped him turn the corner.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Wilfried Zaha has won more fouls than any Premier League player this season\n             \n \n Choosing the right moments to deliver the correct choice of shot, cross, or pass, he has matured as a footballer. \n The third-most successful dribbler in the top flight (behind  Adama Traore  and  Eden Hazard ) the Ivory Coast international also happens to be the  most-kicked player in the PL . \n Last season he was fouled more than anyone else (90 times) and he leads that table again, earning more free-kicks than ever. \n Most-fouled players 2016/17 \n \n \n \n Player \n Fouls won \n \n \n \n \n Wilfried Zaha \n 89 \n \n \n Eden Hazard \n 80 \n \n \n Diego Costa \n 73 \n \n \n Dele Alli \n 62 \n \n \n Ashley Barnes \n 62 \n \n \n \n In a team who traditionally rely on attacking set-plays, this makes Zaha an ideal fit for Palace. \n Arsenal\u2019s defenders must try not to dive in on Zaha too often on this evening. \n Defensively reinforced \n The absence of a bona fide defensive midfielder created instability without the ball for Palace during the first half of the season. \n Jason Puncheon ,  Joe Ledley ,  Yohan Cabaye  and  James McArthur  were all asked to do a job in that role, but it did not suit their natural game. \n Sam Allardyce's signing of  Luka Milivojevic  from Olympiacos in January has remedied the issue.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Luka Milivojevic averages more distance covered per match than any Crystal Palace player\n             \n \n Happy to station himself in front of the back three or four Milivojevic is mobile, aggressive and disciplined. He is a specialist in that position. \n Making 2.84 interceptions and three clearances per match, covering more distance on average than any of his Palace team-mates (11.45km) the 25-year-old has added excellent off-the-ball qualities to the side. \u00a0 \n His presence makes it harder for opponents to expose the Palace defence, while also freeing up Puncheon and Cabaye to push forward. \u00a0 \n Milivojevic touch map v Watford \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n On-loan defender  Mamadou Sakho  has also created a positive impression. \n At his most comfortable alongside  James Tomkins  within a traditional back four, Crystal Palace conceded just once in the 308 minutes when the well-balanced pair have played together. \n A calf problem for Tomkins, an injury that forced him to miss the midweek loss at Southampton, is a real blow for Allardyce.\u00a0 \n \n \n \ud83d\udde3 Opposition view \ud83e\udd15 Injury news \u2694 Head-to-head \ud83d\udcc5 Last meeting Find out all that and more in the preview! https://t.co/f4TPyLrpND \n\u2014 Crystal Palace F.C. (@CPFC)  April 9, 2017 \n \n Sakho has enjoyed being part of a narrow back four that does not hold its line too high. Appearing less isolated than at  Liverpool , the Frenchman has stood firm to great effect. \u00a0 \n Clearing the ball 7.2 times per match and regaining possession on 7.8 occasions each time he plays (both the highest of any Palace regular) Sakho is a defensive leader. \n The Milivojevic and Sakho effect \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n Palace \n Milivojevic \n Sakho \n \n \n \n \n Matches \n 30 \n 6 \n 5 \n \n \n Wins \n 9 \n 4 \n 4 \n \n \n Average pts \n 1.03 \n 2.0 \n 2.4 \n \n \n \n Selhurst stage fright \n It is an unusual statistic, but 81.8% of  Christian Benteke \u2019s goals for Palace have come away from home. \n In theory, without his nine strikes on the road, the Eagles would have eight fewer points. \n Scoring a quartet of towering headers, two six-yard box tap-ins, two penalties, and that clever counter-attacking finish  at Chelsea last weekend , his form has been outstanding on their travels. \n In fact, only  Alexis Sanchez  and  Sergio Aguero  have scored more away goals. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Only two players have scored more than Christian Benteke's nine away goals\n             \n \n On the flip side it is a concern the Eagles have not extracted more from the powerful Belgian on home turf. \n Benteke, 26, has only scored in one of 13 appearances at home and, with five of their eight remaining fixtures at  Selhurst Park , this problem needs to be resolved. \n Sometimes guilty of tightening up, the former Liverpool striker must learn to relax when chances fall his way at home. \n Injury issues \n Crystal Palace\u2019s form has been good, but they are suffering an ill-timed injury crisis ahead of this fixture. \n With 11 players either sidelined or considered doubtful, they top the table when it comes to absent first-teamers. \n Palace\u2019s injured XI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n This situation will frustrate  Sam Allardyce , especially as the Eagles\u2019 manager had just hit on a successful formula. \n Between 25 February and 1 April Allardyce made only one enforced change to his starting XI, and the continuity worked brilliantly. \n During four straights wins, using a well-structured 4-1-4-1 shape, only one goal was conceded. \n During the  3-1 defeat at Southampton , a rejigged Palace looked less comfortable, and at half-time Allardyce reverted to a 3-5-2. \n It will be fascinating to see which formation he uses against the Gunners. \n \n \n It's time to stand up and be counted. \ud83d\udcaa Watch the manager's full press conference for free on  https://t.co/TTogt72Aro  now!  pic.twitter.com/DhlQkNGAdm \n\u2014 Crystal Palace F.C. (@CPFC)  April 10, 2017 \n \n Final thoughts \n Crystal Palace have become a more rounded side in recent weeks, with the players showing a better understanding of their manager\u2019s instructions. \n Resolute and well-drilled out of possession, the Eagles have been harder to break down, which in turn has provided their talented attackers with an easier platform to shine. \n Although statistically creating less, the quality of their opportunities has increased. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                If Wayne Hennessey keeps up his impressive save ratio then Palace can frustrate Arsenal, says Clarke\n             \n \n Palace have also stemmed the flow of set-piece goals scored against them, which was crucial. \n Under the previous regime, 43% of their concessions were from dead balls, but that figure has dropped to just 18% under Allardyce. \n Hard work on the training ground has paid off in this department. \u00a0 \n The Allardyce effect \n \n \n \n 2016/17 \n Pardew \n Allardyce \n \n \n \n \n Hennessey save ratio \n 62.50% \n 70.97% \n \n \n % goals against from set-pieces \n 43% \n 18% \n \n \n Shots per match \n 12.9 \n 10.5 \n \n \n Shots against per match \n 14.0 \n 13.6 \n \n \n \n Last but not least, an upturn in form from goalkeeper  Wayne Hennessey  has also made a difference. The Welshman has been superb of late, making a string of fine saves. \n If Hennessey maintains those levels, Arsenal\u00a0could be in for a frustrating evening. \n See:  #CRYARS team news \n",

    "summary": "The Scout looks for another haul from the Tottenham Hotspur midfield to power the GW32 line-up",
    "text": "\n With 69 points gathered from  our midweek squad , the pressure is on the Gameweek 32 selection to maintain momentum. \n The  Tottenham Hotspur  midfield delivered in a big way  at Swansea City on Wednesday , and we are backing a similar outcome in  Saturday's early kick-off with Watford . \n A string of absentees could weaken Watford's resolve, leaving them exposed to a confident Spurs attack inspired by two in-form Fantasy Premier League assets. \n Willy Caballero (MCI) \u00a34.7m \n The Argentinian has kept three clean sheets in six and is the most secure selection from a shuffling City defence. City\u00a0 host Hull City , who have scored just seven goals on their travels, the fewest by a Premier League side. \n Ben Gibson (MID) \u00a34.9m \n The key figure in a stubborn Boro rearguard, Gibson will look to marshal his defence to a 10th shutout of the season  against Burnley at the Riverside Stadium . Like Hull City, Burnley have struggled for goals on their travels, with nine from 15 matches. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Gameweek 32 Scout Selection\n             \n \n Ben Davies (TOT) \u00a34.8m \n A regular in our selection since he became established in the starting line-up in  Danny Rose 's (\u00a35.9m) absence, Davies looks poised for further returns in Saturday's early kick-off. Spurs boast the strongest home defence, conceding eight goals from 15 matches, while Watford arrive having scored 12 times in 15 away trips. \n Antonio Valencia (MUN) \u00a36.0m \n Rested for the midweek stalemate with Everton, the Ecuadorian looks poised to return for  a visit to Sunderland . The struggling Sunderland are in dire need of a result but have failed to score in the last six Gameweeks. That promises defensive returns for Valencia, who has also produced three assists and a goal in his last eight starts. \n Dele Alli (TOT) \u00a39.1m \n With 12 goals in his last 14 Gameweek starts, the Spurs midfielder was always a shoo-in for the XI ahead of a White Hart Lane encounter with Watford. With the visitors also suffering from key absentees at the back, Alli's prospects look even stronger: he has scored in three successive home matches and claims our Gameweek captaincy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Christian Eriksen (TOT) \u00a38.8m \n While Alli's selection was assured, it was also impossible to ignore Eriksen's claims. The Dane has produced five goals and nine assists over his previous eight home matches and only Manchester United's  Zlatan Ibrahimovic  (\u00a311.4m) has fired more shots than Eriksen\u2019s 111 this season. \n Manuel Lanzini (WHU) \u00a36.4m \n The major bright spark during West Ham's\u00a0recent decline, their manager  Slaven Bilic  will turn to Lanzini's guile to open up  Swansea City at the London Stadium . With three goals and an assist in his last seven Gameweeks, the playmaker has form but is still only found in 3.2% of FPL squads. \n Theo Walcott (ARS) \u00a37.4m \n With  Alexis Sanchez  (\u00a311.7m) deployed in a more traditional wing role on the left, Walcott has come to the fore and outperformed the Chilean both for shots (six v two) and touches in the box (15 v 14) over the last three matches. He has scored in successive Gameweeks and has six goals in as many starts across all competitions ahead of  a match with Crystal Palace . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Raheem Sterling (MCI) \u00a37.8m \n Benched for the midweek defeat to Chelsea, the winger will be expected to earn an immediate recall to Pep Guardiola\u2019s starting line-up for  the visit of Hull City . The Tigers have conceded 35 goals on the road, more than any other Premier League side, presenting Sterling with the opportunity to add to his tally of six goals and 12 assists. \n Sergio Aguero (MCI) \u00a312.7m \n Hull City's defensive record can only promote Aguero's weekend prospects. With four goals in his last five starts and nine in nine in all competitions, he is in prolific form, although a record of just four strikes in 11 home appearances swayed us to look elsewhere for our captain. \n Romelu Lukaku (EVE) \u00a310.4m \n A devastating performer at Goodison Park - with 10 goals from his last six on home turf - we had to keep faith with Lukaku for  a meeting with Leicester City , despite the striker suffering back-to-back blanks. The Belgian scored in the reverse fixture in Gameweek 18 and with the Foxes missing captain Wes Morgan (\u00a34.7m), they could struggle to contain Lukaku\u2019s pace and power. \n",

However, he now faces three Goodison Park fixtures in the next four fixtures, with  Leicester City  the visitors for Gameweek 32. \n Williams will miss that encounter for  Ronald Koeman 's men. He will serve a one-match suspension following the red card that preceded Ibrahimovic's equaliser. \n",

At the start of this I was nervous and I didn't usually talk much to people.

A new threat from set-pieces, Britos has produced a goal and two assists from his last seven starts.\u00a0 \n \n \n GW30 Top Point Scorers 15 - Simpson (\u00a34.8m) & Britos (\u00a34.3m) 13 - Coutinho (\u00a38.2m) 12 - Mustafi (\u00a35.2m) How many of them did you have?  pic.twitter.com/2DSsfZb7vE \n\u2014 FPL (@OfficialFPL)  April 3, 2017 \n \n Craig Cathcart (Watford) \u00a34.3m \n The second Watford defender in the Gameweek XI, Cathcart makes his maiden Dream Team bow courtesy of a clean sheet and assist for Britos\u2019 winner at Vicarage Road \u2013 his first returns in defence or attack this season. \n Danny Simpson (Leicester City) \u00a34.8m \n Another Dream Team debutant, the Foxes defender also accrued 15 points via two assists, a clean sheet and maximum bonus in  a 2-0 win over Stoke City .\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Shkodran Mustafi (Arsenal) \u00a35.8m \n Mustafi scored his second goal of 2016/17 in a  2-2 draw with Manchester City \u00a0and also returned an assist and three bonus points. With  Laurent Koscielny  (\u00a36.2m) sidelined, Arsenal clean sheets may be tougher to come by but Mustafi could yet emerge as a target ahead of 10\u00a0fixtures in the final eight Gameweeks.\u00a0 \n Andrea Ranocchia (Hull City) \u00a34.5m \n The Italian registered his first goal since arriving on loan from Inter Milan in January to secure three points  against West Ham United . Ranocchia\u2019s average of 3.6 points per match is more than any other Hull City defender. \n Philippe Coutinho (Liverpool) \u00a38.3m \n A goal and assist in the  3-1 derby victory over Everton  steered Coutinho to a first double-figure score since Gameweek 11, and a third Dream Team call-up. The 13-point haul, combined with the knee injury suffered by  Sadio Mane  (\u00a39.5m), has established the playmaker as the top transfer target ahead of tonight\u2019s 6.45pm BST Gameweek 31 deadline. More than 161,000 managers have acquired Coutinho for an  Anfield meeting with AFC Bournemouth . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Eric Dier (Tottenham Hotspur) \u00a35.0m \n Pushed into midfield as Spurs chased victory at Burnley, Dier's first goal of 2016/17  in a 2-0 win  earns him a first Dream Team call-up. Classified as a midfielder, Dier has barely been a factor this season, having predominantly played as part of the three-man defence favoured by manager  Mauricio Pochettino . \n Wilfred Ndidi (Leicester City) \u00a34.9m \n The January signing scored a spectacular first Premier League goal  against Stoke City  to secure a fourth successive Foxes victory. Owned by just 0.5% managers, the midfielder has now produced a goal and two assists over the last three Gameweeks, and since making his debut, no other Leicester City player has registered more shots than Ndidi\u2019s 18. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Since his debut in GW21, Wilfred Ndidi has fired in 18 shots, the most by a Leicester player\n             \n \n Wilfried Zaha (Crystal Palace) \u00a35.7m \n A superb performance from the Crystal Palace\u00a0winger, which included a goal and an assist, inspired  Sam Allardyce \u2019s side to a shock  2-1 victory at Stamford Bridge . Zaha\u2019s 11 points was rewarded with a third Dream Team appearance and prompted a surge in FPL ownership. With two matches in Gameweek 34, more than 93,000 FPL managers have already swooped for the Ivory Coast international. \n Christian Benteke (Crystal Palace) \u00a37.0m \n Working so effectively in tandem with Zaha in Saturday's victory, Benteke claims a place alongside his team-mate in the Dream Team, having also provided a goal and assist. The strike at Chelsea\u00a0was only the Belgian\u2019s second goal in his last 14 starts, reviving FPL interest ahead of the Eagles\u2019 approaching double Gameweek. \n",

This included hosting them at Anfield for a match with expenses paid and other efforts to encourage the player, via his family, to sign for Liverpool. League rules strictly prohibit the offer of any inducements to encourage a move. \n Liverpool have cooperated with the Premier League\u2019s inquiries in a timely and thorough manner and admitted the rule breaches asserted against them. \n The club will pay a fine of \u00a3100,000 and will be prohibited from registering any Academy players who have been registered with a Premier League or EFL club in the preceding 18 months. \n This ban will last for two years, with the second year suspended for a three-year period (to be activated in the event of any further similar breach by the club). \n The Premier League will make no further comment on this matter. \u00a0 \n",

Over the last four Gameweeks, the Terriers have scored one goal and are the only side without a single big chance. \n Harry Maguire (LEI) \u00a35.1m \n The defender ranks top for Leicester for clearances, blocks and interceptions (59) and completed passes (228) - both key metrics in the  Bonus Points System  (BPS). Maguire has a goal and two assists already and looks well placed for bonus points if he keeps out  West Bromwich Albion . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Virgil van Dijk (SOU) \u00a35.4m \n Back starting in the  Southampton  defence in Gameweek 7, the Dutchman won more aerial duels than any other PL player and had three shots on goal.

Walker already has two assists and the Potters have allowed more chances to be created from the right wing than any other team. \n Marcos Alonso (CHE) \u00a37.0m \n The wing-back has lost 150,000+ owners over the past two Gameweeks having returned only two points. But we are backing Alonso to revive his fortunes against a Crystal Palace side who are yet to find the net. The Spaniard also ranks top for shots (11) among defenders. \n Ben Davies (TOT) \u00a35.9m \n Davies has created more chances (16) than any other FPL defender and ranks second for shots (10), helping him top the overall defender standings on 49 points. His opponents\u00a0 AFC Bournemouth \u00a0have created only four big chances - only  Brighton & Hove Albion  have fewer (two). \n Raheem Sterling (MCI) \u00a38.0m \n Five goals from four starts means Sterling heads into a home meeting with Stoke\u00a0backed by more than 116,000 new owners. When available for selection, he has been named in Guardiola's starting line-up for each match since Gameweek 3. \n Dele Alli (TOT) \u00a39.5m \n Alli is suspended for the UEFA Champions League trip to Real Madrid and is therefore\u00a0set for a full 90 minutes against AFC Bournemouth. The Cherries have kept only four clean sheets in 27 away matches, as Alli bids to end a run of four Gameweeks without a goal.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n Richarlison (WAT) \u00a36.2m \n The three-goal Brazilian boasts 18 shots in the penalty area, second only to  Mohamed Salah  (\u00a39.2m) among FPL midfielders.

Yet to score at Wembley Stadium in the Premier League, Kane nonetheless has six goals in his three previous matches against AFC Bournemouth and wears our Gameweek 8 armband. \n Gabriel Jesus (MCI) \u00a310.6m \n We expect Jesus to lead the Man City attack against Stoke City despite  Sergio Aguero 's (\u00a311.5m) return to training following a rib injury.

    "text": "\n The loyal and passionate support of fans, following their teams across the country come rain or shine, is hugely appreciated by the clubs, their managers and players, and by the Premier League. \n It is why the League takes great pride in its clubs enjoying record levels of occupancy at stadiums, which were on average 96.5% full last season. \n It is achieved by the clubs delivering value to the fans at their grounds, and research has shown that more than half of Premier League tickets sold this season will cost \u00a330 or less. \n This can be revealed after the most comprehensive analysis available of the real cost of attending Premier League football, compiling data provided directly by the clubs. \n This analysis, conducted along with EY, included the price of every ticket already sold or available this season. \n As well as the results showing that 54% of all tickets sold this season will cost \u00a330 or less, the research also found that the average ticket price across the League is \u00a332. \n To ensure that loyal fans are rewarded and stadiums are well attended, one third of the half a million Premier League season tickets sold by clubs are sold below their full prices. \n Indeed, fans with season tickets will have saved a total of \u00a310million across the season through such discounts offered by clubs. \n The importance of away fans has also been recognised by clubs with the \u00a330 cap on away ticket prices, which came into being in 2016/17, in place for this season and next. \n Indeed, this season the average away ticket price will be under the cap, at \u00a326, with a third of away tickets sold below \u00a330. \n \"This research shows the excellent value clubs are offering across the League and the impressive commitment of their fans,\" said Premier League Executive Chairman, Richard Scudamore. \"I hope it will challenge commonly held perceptions about the cost of attending Premier League football, and encourage even more people to consider going to a match.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n This research \u2013 the second of its kind following last season\u2019s inaugural study \u2013 includes all parts of Premier League stadiums, except hospitality areas, and includes all ticket types sold or made available by Premier League clubs in the 2017/18 season, including junior, adult, senior and disabled. \n All matchday tickets include booking fees or admin charges. \n The data was provided by Premier League clubs and then analysed by professional services company EY (Ernst & Young) and the Premier League. \n See:  2016/17 findings \n",

    "text": "\n Adrian Clarke is analysing three teams' starts to the season, and what they are doing right or wrong.\u00a0 \n Marco Silva  has breathed new life into  Watford  during the opening seven matches of 2017/18. \n Playing an attack-minded brand of football that has enthused players and supporters, the head coach and his less changeable strategies have given Watford grounds for optimism. \n What has changed? \n In terms of formation Watford look more comfortable and balanced in a straightforward 4-2-3-1, with 4-3-3 and a 3-4-3 for a half against  Swansea City \u00a0the only change made under Silva. \n This is a far cry from last season when the head coach,\u00a0 Walter Mazzarri , tinkered with 11 different shapes, creating tactical bewilderment among the players. \n Silva has added significant speed to his team, too. \n Right-back  Kiko Femenia  is lightning quick, while the winger in front\u00a0 Andre Carrillo , is also blessed with a rapid turn of pace. \n In fact, four of Watford\u2019s top six fastest current players this season are newcomers to the squad. \n When they go forward now, there is noticeably more zip to Watford's play. \n Watford's quickest players 2017/18 \n \n \n \n Player \n Top speed (km/h) \n \n \n \n \n Kiko Femenia* \n 35.12 \n \n \n Jose Holebas \n 34.52 \n \n \n Christian Kabasele \n 34.14 \n \n \n Richarlison* \n 33.21 \n \n \n Andre Gray* \n 33.16 \n \n \n Andre Carrillo* \n 33.02 \n \n \n \n *signed in the summer of 2017 \n There is also a far better work ethic. \n Under the more defensive Mazzarri, the Hornets were often passive opponents, but Silva likes his players to display energy and verve. In fact, he demands it of them. \n Off the ball there is a willingness to press, and in possession we are seeing a great deal more vibrancy to the way they pass and move. \n The statistics show a colossal difference in the way Watford cover ground under their new head coach. \n Harder-working Hornets \n \n \n \n Per 90min\u00a0 \n 2016/17 \n 2017/18 \n % rise \n \n \n \n \n Distance covered \n 107.7km \n 111.7km \n 4.3% \n \n \n Sprints \n 483.7 \n 544.0 \n 12.5% \n \n \n \n More proactive and determined in what they do, especially away from home, it perhaps should come as no surprise that Watford's three wins on the road under Silva are as many as they achieved in the whole of 2016/17. \n Only  Manchester City  and  Tottenham Hotspur  have scored more goals away from home. \n That means that after only four of 19 away matches in 2017/18, Watford have amassed over half the goals they scored on their travels last season. \n Dynamite Doucoure \n The development of certain individuals has also sparked an improvement and no one has shone brighter than  Abdoulaye Doucoure . \n After making a quiet start to life at Vicarage Road, the central midfielder has enjoyed an outstanding 2017. Building on the promise he showed towards the end of last season, the Frenchman has become Watford's star man this term. \n The six-footer is strong and mobile, regularly covering the most distance for Silva\u2019s men and, alongside  Nathaniel Chalobah  or  Etienne Capoue , is often seen bossing the centre of midfield. \n Doucoure has won possession inside the middle third 31 times (ranking him 5th in the PL) and also tops Watford\u2019s charts for touches, passes and ball recoveries. \n He has also produced three goals in seven Premier League appearances. \n While the Brazilian youngster  Richarlison  has been their stellar signing, adding skill, aggression and a goal threat from the left, the team\u2019s most improved player under Silva has to be Doucoure. \n He looks a midfielder reborn and if this Watford side are to continue to surpass their expectations in 2017/18, they will need him to stay fit and healthy. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Possession game helping Man City defence \n Part 2:  Lack of continuity checking Chelsea progress \n Part 4:\u00a0 Full-back focus key for Palace to stop Chelsea \n Part 5:  Can Stoke pressure lead to Man City repeat? \n Part 6:  Pace and width can hasten Everton revival \n",

    "summary": "Adrian Clarke identifies where the Eagles can improve to frustrate the Blues on Saturday",
    "text": "\n A disastrous start to the season has left new manager  Roy Hodgson  with a number of problems to solve on the  Crystal Palace  training ground. \n However, ahead of their home match against  Chelsea  this weekend I suspect he will be focusing plenty of attention on the duties of his full-backs. \n While none of the Eagles players have particularly shone so far in 2017/18, improvements can be made from front to back. \n The south Londoners have looked especially vulnerable when defending out wide. Making too many poor decisions and failing to get their full-back positioning correct, several opponents have seized on this area to score goals. \n Eight\u00a0of Palace's last nine concessions have had a similar feel \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Don't be outflanked \n As shown in the chalkboard above the last two matches have exposed serious flaws, with their right flank targeted. \n Manchester United (red) and Manchester City (blue) both wreaked havoc down that particular wing, giving respective right-backs Joel Ward and Timothy Fosu-Mensah an extremely hard time \n Looking at the goals, Ward was beaten in a 1v1 on the outside by Marcus Rashford at Old Trafford, before the youngster delivered a smart cutback for Juan Mata's early opener. \n Later on in the same contest Anthony Martial ran in behind Ward to cross for Romelu Lukaku to score. \n At Manchester City during a 5-0 defeat, right-back Fosu-Mensah was undone by a one-two, where Leroy Sane ran in behind him for the first goal. \n And in the second half of the same contest, Sane found enough room to curl a lovely cross over\u00a0the young full-back for Raheem Sterling to dispatch. \n Marking improvement \n It would be wrong to pin the blame for those painful defeats solely at the door of the right-backs, for Patrick van Aanholt, at left-back, has also been exposed. \n The adventurous Dutchman was caught out of position high upfield for Lukaku's late strike, leaving himself too much to do to get goal-side when the cross was sent to the far post. He was 20 yards short of United's leading scorer at the moment he netted. \n At City, Van Aanholt also found himself on the wrong side of Sterling when Sane crossed for him to score. With his starting position too advanced, he had no chance to recover from a turnover or counter. \n There are also question marks over the Palace man's covering at the far post. \n In the Etihad encounter Sergio Aguero snuck in behind him to nod a header down for Sterling to score, and by tucking in too far against United, he was also powerless to prevent Marouane Fellaini bundling in Ashley Young's centre. \n Wide men must get tighter \n Crystal Palace's wingers also have a responsibility to offer their team-mates more defensive protection. \n In both of their last two Premier League outings when the back four have tucked in to become extra narrow and compact, Andros Townsend has found himself in the right-back slot. \n Once there he stood too far off his opponents. \n By failing to block crosses, Townsend afforded both Young and Sane the space to whip deliveries past him without a block. From those balls into the area, Fellaini and Aguero both scored. \n Shackling Chelsea \n Hodgson has his hands full improving all aspects of Palace's play but the way they defend the flanks against the reigning champions on Saturday is a matter of high priority. \n One of the main tasks in hand will be to restrict the influence of Chelsea's flying wing-backs. \n Marcos Alonso and Victor Moses are so often the source of goal opportunities and must not be allowed to run amok. \n Palace should also be wary of leaving space for the Blues' attacking midfielders to dart into wide channels behind the full-backs. If they do, the Eagles will be punished. \n Eleven of the 17 goals Palace have shipped so far in 2017/18 have stemmed from crosses, with nine of those from open play. \n If these issues aren't addressed Chelsea will also exploit the space down the sides. \n Tomorrow : Can Stoke halt Man City progress? \n Also in series \n Part 1:  Possession game helping City defence \n Part 2:  Lack of continuity checking Chelsea progress \n Part 3:  Doucoure at the heart of Watford's rise \n Part 5:  Can Stoke pressure lead to Man City repeat? \n Part 6:  Pace and width can hasten Everton revival \n",

    "text": "\n Mark Hughes \u00a0is a manager who relishes the opportunity to claim big-name scalps and he takes his  Stoke City  side to  Manchester City \u00a0on Saturday in search of another, writes Adrian Clarke. \n Stoke battled to a 0-0 draw at the Etihad Stadium on their last visit there in March, and on the back of excellent performances at home to  Arsenal  and  Manchester United  this season, they will feel capable of upsetting the odds again. \n So what's their best chance of halting the unbeaten Man City?\u00a0It has to be a focus on positivity, work-rate and aggression. \n When Stoke set about difficult challenges like this with a combative mindset, they tend to ruffle feathers and achieve better results. \n Against  Chelsea , when they were without too many first-choice defensive players, they comprehensively lost the physical battle. They were outworked and outplayed by the champions. \n But that didn't happen against Arsenal or Man Utd. \n Although goalkeeper  Jack Butland  was called upon to make some vital saves, there was a better tempo and a fierce determination to win their tackles and duels in those matches. \n Together from back to front they worked incredibly hard to limit their opponents' rhythm. \n Their industrious and confrontational style was effective. \n Stoke's aggressive style \n \n \n \n \u00a0Opponent \n Chelsea \n Man Utd \n Arsenal \n \n \n \n \n Score \n L 0-4 \n D 2-2 \n W 1-0 \n \n \n Duels won \n 42.3% \n 53.7% \n 54.5% \n \n \n Share of tackles \n 40.9% \n 67.8% \n 55.8% \n \n \n Km ran \n 103.3 \n 110.1 \n 113.3 \n \n \n \n While you can make a case for Hughes' switch to a back three aiding Stoke's defensive stability in matches like this, I'd suggest the influence of two new attacking players has made just as big a difference. \n Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting , pictured top, and  Jese  were both hugely prominent against Arsenal and United, offering great outlets for the defence and midfield to relieve pressure. \n On the counter-attack they took the fight to both those teams with a series of driving runs and positive ball carries. \n Playing fearlessly, using their strength and skill to good effect, they posed a genuine goal threat that made both opponents edgy at the back. \n Influence v Arsenal and Man Utd \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n Choupo-Moting \n Jese \n \n \n \n \n Shots \n 9 \n 5 \n \n \n Key passes \n 2 \n 4 \n \n \n Goals \n 2 \n 1 \n \n \n \n While Stoke will likely have the minority of possession, and inevitably come under serious pressure, they need the likes of Choupo-Moting, Jese and  Xherdan Shaqiri  to threaten on the turnover. \n Sitting deep and holding out for 90 minutes is a big ask, so it's vital they help the team get up the pitch and give their defenders a breather. \n Should a very attack-minded Man City side leave holes at the back, it's then down to Stoke's front men to capitalise, and I\u2019d suggest the wide channels in behind the full-backs are a possible avenue for success.\u00a0 \n The key ingredient for Stoke in this fixture is assertiveness. Playing a passive, cagey game is unlikely to be enough to halt the leaders' progress. \n Also in this series\u00a0 \n Part 1:  Possession game helping City defence \n Part 2:  Lack of continuity checking Chelsea progress \n Part 3:  Doucoure at the heart of Watford's rise \n Part 4:  Full-back focus key for Palace hopes \n Part 6:  Pace and width can hasten Everton revival \n",

    "text": "\n A home encounter with  AFC Bournemouth  could make  Harry Kane  (\u00a312.7m) the most popular captain pick for  Fantasy Premier League  managers in Gameweek 8. \n Romelu Lukaku  (\u00a311.8m) has been the top captain choice in each of the first seven Gameweeks, but  Manchester United  face a testing trip to  Liverpool  in Saturday's early kick-off. \n Interest in Kane is on the rise as a result, gaining 342,000+ new owners and he is now part of 39.4% of squads. \n Although Kane has yet to score a Premier League goal at Wembley Stadium, the  Tottenham Hotspur  striker is in the mood to break that run. \n He has scored braces in three of the last four Gameweeks and has 15 goals for club and country since the start of September. \n Kane has also supplied three goals and an assist in his last two home appearances against the Cherries. \n Lukaku still in demand \n But Lukaku's form is not easily ignored.\u00a0Still included in 59.3% of squads, he has netted seven times in as many Gameweeks, failing to score on only one occasion. \n He also found the net over the international break with Belgium. \n However, he is set to face a Liverpool side who have been resilient at Anfield, conceding only one goal in three matches. \n Man City options \n Manchester City 's free-scoring attack is perhaps the most likely source to challenge Kane and Lukaku for big scores. \n They take on a  Stoke City  side who have conceded nine goals in the last four Gameweeks. \n With  Sergio Aguero  (\u00a311.5m) set to remain sidelined with injury,  Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a310.5m) will be backed by an army of new owners. \n He is second only to Kane for transfers in, claiming more than 284,000 new managers. \n The Brazilian has registered four goals and an assist in his previous four Gameweek appearances. \n Leroy Sane  (\u00a38.3m) and  Raheem Sterling  (\u00a37.9m) provide Man City's goal threat from midfield. \n Sane has supplied 29 points in the last two home fixtures, while Sterling has scored five times in his previous five Gameweek appearances. \n Hazard on radar \n Having netted twice over the international break,  Eden Hazard  (\u00a310.5m) may prove a powerful differential. \n Boasting a 3% ownership, he could be deployed in a central attacking role in the likely absence of striker  Alvaro Morata  (\u00a310.3m) against a  Crystal Palace  side who have conceded in all seven Gameweeks and have faced more shots on target (44) than any other side. \n Sanchez effect \n Alexis Sanchez  (\u00a311.9m) is showing signs of a return to form ahead of  Arsenal 's trip to  Watford . \n The Chilean fired more shots (eight) than any player in Gameweek 7 and produced a goal and two assists in this fixture last season. \n Like Hazard, Sanchez's ownership of 2.6% makes him a potentially effective differential captain for those managers bidding to make up ground. \n See:  The Scout's GW8 Ones to watch \n",

    "text": "\n Jamie Vardy  is often the match-winner for  Leicester City,  but  Curtis Davies  says it is one of two other players\u00a0who hold the key to victory against  West Bromwich Albion . \n Vardy has fully recovered from a hip injury and has scored in three of his last five Premier League appearances against the Baggies. \n He also has five goals already this season but Davies, now of Derby County, says Monday night\u2019s match will be won or lost on the wings - by\u00a0 Riyad Mahrez  or  Demarai Gray . \n \u201cUsually you don\u2019t look past Vardy,\u201d says Davies, who has played for both clubs. \u201cBut I think in this game, with the way West Brom defend, it\u2019ll be hard for him to find those spaces in behind. \n \u201cSo it\u2019s likely to be Gray or Mahrez, who can break the lines and do a little trick that creates something to get through West Brom\u2019s defence. \n \"It\u2019s not going to be easy for Vardy to get in behind like he normally does, so it\u2019s going to take a moment of magic to unlock them.\u201d \n Davies believes Vardy can still have a big impact on the match, as his threat of running in behind could free up space for Leicester\u2019s midfielders to exploit. \n But having played with and against current members of the West Brom squad, he says Pulis will be working hard on the training ground to get his team to flip Leicester\u2019s game plan on themselves. \n \u201cTo deal with Vardy they\u2019ll probably sit a little deeper, but although there would be more space in front of them, they have compact lines and they\u2019re well-drilled. \n \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve been told they work on team shape every day in training. So if they are able to defend well and Leicester get drawn into being too expansive then with the pace of  Matt Phillips ,  Salomon Rondon  and  Jay Rodriguez  on the break, West Brom could flip Leicester\u2019s game on themselves and be the counter-attacking team.\u201d \n See:  Shakespeare praises work ethic ahead of West Brom match \n",

    "text": "\n Can  Romelu Lukaku  get the better of  Joel Matip  when  Manchester United  visit  Liverpool  on Saturday? \n It is a key duel that the Premier League's leading scorer has previously struggled to win, writes\u00a0 Sky Sports' Matt Cheetham . \n Matip strengths \n Matip is particularly skilled in one-on-one situations, an essential trait for any defender playing under Jurgen Klopp. He was dribbled past only six times last season, compared with  Dejan Lovren  (18),  Nathaniel Clyne  (23) and  James Milner  (49). \n Another strong part of Matip's game is his ability to premeditate attacking movement, highlighted by his high interception count -  Nacho Monreal  is the only Premier League defender with more than his 19 this season. \n Liverpool will need the 26-year-old defender to be at his best to contain Lukaku. \n An improved Lukaku?\u00a0 \n The Belgium international has been in rampant form since moving to Old Trafford. He's the PL's top scorer with seven goals and no player has scored more in their first seven matches for Man Utd in the competition's history. \n Lukaku's attacking stats rank among the best. Only  Harry Kane  has had more shots on target, while Kane and  Sergio Aguero  are the only strikers with more touches in the opposition's box. \n How Lukaku ranks \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n Lukaku \n PL rank \n \n \n \n \n Shots on target \n 15 \n 2 \n \n \n Shots in box \n 25 \n 2 \n \n \n Chance conversion \n 22.6% \n 6 \n \n \n Shot accuracy \n 65% \n 4 \n \n \n Touches in opp. box \n 45 \n 4 \n \n \n \n It's also interesting to note that Lukaku's chance-conversion rate is almost identical to his final season at  Everton . \n The striker still needs around four-and-a-half shots to score but his numbers have improved in other areas. \n Lukaku season comparison \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n 2016/17 \n 2017/18 \n \n \n \n \n Total shots \n 3.0 \n 4.4 \n \n \n Shots on target \n 1.5 \n 2.1 \n \n \n Shots in box \n 2.2 \n 3.6 \n \n \n Chance conversion \n 22.7 \n 22.6 \n \n \n Touches \n 41.8 \n 35.1 \n \n \n Touches in opp. box \n 5.2 \n 6.4 \n \n \n \n Perhaps the only remaining narrative for Lukaku to quash relates to his impact on \"bigger\" matches; a concern further emphasised by past performances against Liverpool. \n In his last appearance, his only previous one against Matip, he failed to record a single shot in 90 minutes. It's something he's done only five times in his last 86 Premier League appearances, twice against Liverpool. \n In fact, despite averaging an attempt every 27 minutes over the past three seasons, Lukaku is on a remarkable run of no shots in his last 204 minutes played at Anfield. Going back further, he has only managed to test the opposing goalkeeper with a shot on target in two of his last seven appearances against the Reds. \n This may encourage Matip ahead of Saturday but Lukaku's new surroundings make him far more of a factor in the final third than he has previously been at Anfield. \n See:  Lukaku's stats when he last played Matip \n",

    "text": "\n Sadio Mane 's (\u00a39.4m) hamstring injury could persuade more  Fantasy Premier League  managers to look to  Philippe Coutinho  (\u00a39.0m). \n With two goals and an assist in the last two Gameweeks, the Brazilian has earned 92,000+ new owners ahead of Saturday's 11:30 BST deadline. \n Interest could now escalate following Mane's setback. \n The winger is ruled out of Saturday's meeting with  Manchester United  and could be sidelined for up to six weeks with the injury sustained on international duty with Senegal. \n Coutinho retreated to a central midfield role at  Newcastle United  in Gameweek 7 but could now shift to the left of  Jurgen Klopp 's front three. \n Since returning to action in Gameweek 5, he has produced more shots (17) and key passes (14) than any other player. \n Mane's absence will also allow\u00a0 Roberto Firmino  (\u00a38.5m) to push for a return to the starting XI. \n He dropped to the bench for the first time this season against the Magpies. \n Firmino's recent lack of points - with only one goal in six Gameweeks - has led to over 132,000 sales. \n Renewed interest in  Liverpool \u00a0options could soon be driven by an improving schedule of fixtures. \n From Gameweek 10, seven of their subsequent nine opponents score only two in the  Fixture Difficulty Rankings  (FDR). \n But FPL managers should be wary of the impact of Mane's absence on Liverpool's attack. \n The winger recently missed Gameweeks 5 and 6 through suspension. \n During those matches, against  Burnley  and  Leicester City , Klopp's men created fewer big chances - or chances where the receiving player should score. \n Having recorded 3.2 big chances per match in Gameweeks 1-4, this fell to only 1.5 without Mane. \n Indeed, since Mane's arrival on Merseyside, Liverpool have scored 2.2 goals per Premier League match with him in their line-up and 1.5 goals without him. \n See:  The Scout's GW8 Ones to watch \n",

No player with more than two starts can better that level of goal involvement. \n There are other statistics that highlight his importance to Chris Hughton\u2019s side. \n Gross has produced more crosses (43) and created more chances (15) than any team-mate. \n Set-piece threat \n Set-piece duties are a big factor behind those numbers. \n The midfielder has taken 20 of Brighton\u2019s 29 corners, with centre-backs  Shane Duffy  (\u00a34.5m) and  Lewis Dunk  (\u00a34.4m) providing threatening targets for his supply. \n They have recorded 12 shots from set-plays, more than any other central-defensive pairing. \n Now Gross must bid to maintain his influence over a promising run of fixtures, beginning with the visit of  Everton  in Gameweek 8. \n Ronald Koeman\u2019s side have conceded seven goals in three away matches, and 12 in total. \n Only four teams have allowed more shots on target than the Toffees (33). \n After the Everton match, five of Brighton\u2019s next six opponents score two or less in the  Fixture Difficulty Rankings  (FDR). \n Brighton's next seven Gameweeks \n \n \n \n GW \n Opponent \n FDR \n \n \n \n \n 8 \n EVE (H) \n 3 \n \n \n 9 \n WHU (A) \n 2 \n \n \n 10 \n SOU (H) \n 2 \n \n \n 11 \n SWA (A) \n 2 \n \n \n 12 \n STK (H) \n 2 \n \n \n 13 \n MUN (A) \n 4 \n \n \n 14 \n CRY (H) \n 1 \n \n \n \n Gross is part of 13.7% of FPL squads, with early investment fuelled by an 18-point haul in Gameweek 4. \n While the flow of points has slowed over recent matches, he still ranks third for points-per million-value (6.3) among midfielders. \n And with Brighton's schedule improving, Gross has the platform to repeat that early impact. \n Also in this series\u00a0 \n Part 1:\u00a0 Harry Maguire \n Part 2:\u00a0 Virgil van Dijk \n Part 3:  Raheem Sterling \n Part 5:  Alexis Sanchez \n",

So its time to adopt that approach in Draft.\u00a0 \n If, like me, you are floundering after the opening Gameweeks, then I'd recommend a similar strategy. \n There should be plenty of defensive talent left in the free agent pool; I've got my eye on  Stephen Ward  following his 12 points at Everton. \n Dipping in for defenders while shifting formation, perhaps even to a 5-3-2, may just prove to be the perfect quick fix. \n Gameweek 8 fixtures \n Sean's Super Subs  (US)\u00a0v\u00a0 Suther ns Comfort  (UK)\u00a0 Get on the Snake  (US) v\u00a0 Woody Allen  (UK)\u00a0 10 Huddersfield Lane  (US) v\u00a0 Rotoworld PL  (US)\u00a0 Andy's Allstars \u00a0(UK) v\u00a0 Jonty's XI \u00a0(UK) \n \u00a0See:  FPL Draft: What you need to know \n The FPL Draft GW8 Waiver deadline is Friday 13 October, 1130 BST \n",

    "summary": "Duncan Alexander, of Opta, explains the latest tool to help us understand who are the Premier League's real danger men",
    "text": "\n When managers prepare their teams in the Premier League, many will look to negate the player who conducts most of the opposition's attacks. \n One way to understand which players are making the key contributions to a team\u2019s output is through sequencing, the latest analytical model from Opta.\u00a0 \n Sequencing, which is ended by defensive actions, stoppages in play, or a shot, can also shine a light on the different styles of play teams are adopting in their search for success.\u00a0 \n It also allows us to identify for the first time players who are consistently involved in progressive play, whether or not they end up with a goal or an assist. \n On this basis, the table below shows the players in the Premier League this season who have been involved in the most sequences to have ended in a shot.\u00a0Not surprisingly, given the nature of football, the vast majority of them are creative midfielders or strikers, but there are a few surprising names in the list. \n Most involvement in sequences ending in a shot \n \n \n \n Player \n Involvements \n \n \n \n \n David Silva \n 53 \n \n \n Christian Eriksen \n 51 \n \n \n Oriol Romeu \n 48 \n \n \n Kevin De Bruyne \n 47 \n \n \n Nathan Redmond \n 47 \n \n \n Sergio Aguero \n 46 \n \n \n Harry Kane \n 45 \n \n \n Mohamed Salah \n 44 \n \n \n Henrikh Mkhitaryan \n 44 \n \n \n Romelu Lukaku \n 43 \n \n \n \n The vivid attacking strength  Manchester City  have shown so far this campaign is represented here with  David Silva ,  Kevin De Bruyne  and  Sergio Aguero  all in the top six (Aguero is narrowly higher than  Harry Kane  despite playing a match fewer). \n Despite all the recent attacking signings at the Etihad Stadium, Silva, a man in his eighth season at the club, remains the orchestral heart of the team, while he is closely followed by  Tottenham Hotspur \u2019s  Christian Eriksen , who remains curiously underrated in some quarters. \n Perhaps the most surprising entries in the list are the  Southampton  pair of  Oriol Romeu  and  Nathan Redmond , in third and fifth respectively. \n Southampton have been troubled by poor finishing for some time, hitting 106 shots this season, 20 more than  Chelsea , but having scored only five times. \n Clubs use sequencing data to identify and nullify the key passing channels of their opponents but variations in finishing naturally make a massive difference, too. (Note too that  Watford , Southampton and  Crystal Palace  have similar expected goals (xG) figures of 8.9, 8.6 and 8.1, yet have scored 11, five and zero goals respectively). \n Man City\u2019s relentless verve is illustrated even more clearly in the list of players who have been involved in the most sequences that have led to goals. \n Their top three are Aguero, De Bruyne and  Kyle Walker , with Silva level with three others on eight, while  Fernandinho  and  Nicolas Otamendi  are just behind on seven. \n Anyone who has observed Man City this season will know their play has been complex and layered; now we can see the underlying numbers that reflect this. \n It\u2019s all very well being able to identify the opposition\u2019s key men but when virtually the entire team constitute a threat there\u2019s usually only one outcome (as Man City\u2019s current goal difference of +20 suggests). \n Most involvement in sequences ending in a goal \n \n \n \n Player \n Involvements \n \n \n \n \n Sergio Aguero \n 12 \n \n \n Kevin De Bruyne \n 11 \n \n \n Kyle Walker \n 9 \n \n \n David Silva \n 8 \n \n \n Romelu Lukaku \n 8 \n \n \n Alvaro Morata \n 8 \n \n \n Danilo \n 8 \n \n \n Harry Kane \n 7 \n \n \n Fernandinho \n 7 \n \n \n Nicolas Otamendi \n 7 \n \n \n Nemanja Matic \n 7 \n \n \n \n Sequence data also enables analysis of a team\u2019s style of play using two variables: the average speed of each sequence\u2019s progression upfield (in layman\u2019s terms, how quickly does a team attack?), and the average number of passes in a sequence (how intricate is a team?). \n These two factors are not interdependent; you can have both slow and fast teams who pass quite a lot and slow and fast teams who get the ball up the pitch more quickly. \n The top four teams for passes per sequence this season are Man City (5.10 passes),  Arsenal  (4.37) and  Manchester United  and Spurs (both 3.89). \n Of those four, only Arsenal are in the top 10 for speed of progression, making  Arsene Wenger \u2019s team the fastest and most intricate side in the League. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                PL teams in 2017/18: Passes per sequence v direct speed\n             \n \n Compare that with  Liverpool , who have the fifth-fastest sequence direct speed, yet are the only team in that top five to average more than three passes per sequence. \n Jurgen Klopp \u2019s \u201cheavy metal\u201d football, reliant on winning back possession as high up the pitch as possible and countering the opposition before they have recovered, is clearly visible in these numbers. \n Chelsea, on the other hand, average a similar number of passes per sequence as Liverpool, but their progression speed is notably slower. \n Fans of traditional English fare, though, should head to  Craig Shakespeare \u2019s charges as  Leicester City  have the second-fastest sequence speed and the second-lowest average number of passes in a sequence. \n This blueprint was the formula that led the Foxes to the Premier League title less than 18 months ago, and it seems clear that Shakespeare is sticking to his script, one also followed quite closely by the likes of  Rafa Benitez ,  Sean Dyche  and  Mark Hughes  this season. \n",

    "summary": "Former midfielder explains why Klopp v Mourinho is the key battle to watch when Liverpool host Man Utd on Saturday",
    "text": "\n Much focus will be on individual players when  Liverpool  host\u00a0 Manchester United \u00a0at 12:30 BST on Saturday.\u00a0 \n Can  Romelu Lukaku \u00a0become the first player to score eight goals in his first eight Premier League matches for United? Can the Red Devils withstand Liverpool's electric attack? \n But  Danny Murphy  believes the match at Anfield will be won not on the pitch but on the touchline, by the tactics adopted by managers  Jurgen Klopp  and  Jose Mourinho . \n But even here, the former Liverpool midfielder, who scored winning goals for the Merseyside club at Old Trafford on three occasions in the PL, is unsure as to what approach the pair will take. \n Mourinho has developed a reputation for nullifying his opponents and Murphy says United's game plan on Merseyside could be based on shutting down Liverpool's creativity. \n \"The tactical aspect of the game is more important than any individual battle,\" Murphy, who made 417 PL appearances, says. \n \"United aren't going to want to leave  Mohamed Salah  one on one. \n \"Because they've got so much pace now, and  Philippe Coutinho  with his creativity, United are probably going to defend in numbers. \n \"Coutinho's the one to make them tick. If you keep him quiet you could be in with a chance. But when you've got players like Salah, teams automatically drop. Because if you leave them space to run into they'll kill you. So your game plan has to change. \n \"Of course when you defend in numbers that means you give up possession.\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                Danny Murphy thinks Man Utd could sit deep to try to negate the threat of Mohamed Salah and Philippe Coutinho\n             \n \n But Murphy is wary of predicting that this could be the United manager's main tactic. \n \"You never know with Mourinho, he can change his ways. He has been known to be pragmatic and put everyone behind the ball and nick a 1-0 win. But he's done the opposite at times. \n \"When he went to  Chelsea  [last season] and went man to man [marking], it was brilliant.\" \n Murphy says the patient approach and counter-attacking prowess shown in Liverpool's 4-0 home win against Arsenal earlier this season could be fruitful again if Klopp wishes to adopt the more measured game plan, rather than the high press associated with his \"heavy metal\" football. \n \"When Liverpool beat Arsenal so convincingly at Anfield, Liverpool kept dropping off,\" says Murphy. \"There was no high press. They let Arsenal have it. \n \"And then when it got to a certain point they pressed and kept hitting them on the break and killing them because Arsenal were high up the pitch. Liverpool were tactically brilliant that day.\" \n See:  Sadio Mane sustains hamstring injury \n",

    "text": "\n The Scout is tipping five players to back for\u00a0 Fantasy Premier League \u00a0Gameweek 8. \n Raheem Sterling (MCI) \u00a37.9m \n We are witnessing a more clinical Sterling. \n He has five Premier League goals this season having been entrusted with a central attacking role by Pep Guardiola. \n That makes him the leading goalscorer among FPL midfielders and second only to  Sergio Aguero  (\u00a311.5m and six goals) for\u00a0 Manchester City . \n And with Aguero expected to miss the Gameweek 8 visit of  Stoke City  with a rib injury, although the forward did return to light training this morning, the onus will be on Sterling to maintain his early season form. \n Sterling's underlying statistics are hugely impressive. \n He ranks second for both shots (19) and penalty-area shots (14) in the Man City squad. \n The 22-year-old has averaged an effort every 20.3 minutes, more frequently than any other FPL midfielder with more than three starts. \n That return also betters team-mate  Gabriel Jesus  (\u00a310.5m) who has registered a shot every 24.5 minutes. \n Despite that, the Brazilian has attracted more than 219,000 new owners ahead of Gameweek 8, compared with Sterling's 63,000+. \n Sterling has also had 46 touches in the opposition\u2019s penalty area \u2013 again more than Jesus (38) and second only to Aguero (47) and  Harry Kane  (\u00a312.7m and 55) overall. \n Sterling in 2017/18 \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n Total \n Man City rank \n \n \n \n \n Shots \n 19 \n 2 \n \n \n Shots in box \n 14 \n 2 \n \n \n Shots on target \n 7 \n 2= \n \n \n ICT Threat \n 274 \n 3 \n \n \n \n Managers may be put off by Guardiola's rotation policy.\u00a0\u00a0 \n But Sterling has started the last four matches for which he has been available, missing only the Gameweek 4 trip to Liverpool through suspension. \n That looks crucial to his FPL prospects ahead of back-to-back home matches. \n Burnley  will be the visitors in Gameweek 9 following a midweek UEFA Champions League home meeting with Napoli. \n Sterling has been introduced from the bench in both European fixtures so far, indicating that he is set to start against both Stoke and the Clarets a week later. \n Man City have scored more goals (22) and created more big chances (30) than any other team. \n Guardiola\u2019s decision to bring Sterling inside from his position on the flank, trusting him to complement the potency of strikers Aguero and Jesus, has been a key factor. \n Part of only 6.1% of squads, Sterling can prove a powerful differential. \n Also in this series\u00a0 \n Part 1:  Harry Maguire \n Part 2:  Virgil van Dijk \n Part 4:  Pascal Gross \n Part 5:  Alexis Sanchez \n",

    "text": "\n The Scout is naming five players to target for\u00a0 Fantasy Premier League  Gameweek 8. \n Virgil van Dijk (SOU) \u00a35.4m \n The Dutch defender is back on the radar as an option for FPL managers. \n Van Dijk was handed a first Premier League start for  Southampton  in Gameweek 7. \n He failed to prevent a 2-1 defeat by\u00a0 Stoke City  but, despite conceding a penalty which was missed by the Potters, he made an impressive return. \n Van Dijk produced 14 clearances, blocks and interceptions (CBI). It's a key statistic in the  Bonus Points System  (BPS) and was\u00a0double that of any team-mate. \n He won a Gameweek-high 11 aerial duels and was\u00a0a threat on the attack, recording three shots on goal. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n The centre-back has shown his Fantasy potential since signing for Southampton ahead of 2015/16. \n A debut season brought three goals and 16 bonus points. \n That was followed by a goal and 14 bonus points from only 21 starts in an injury-hit 2016/17. \n The Southampton defence has been a key source of FPL talent. \n Mauricio Pellegrino\u2019s men have been blessed with a favourable run of recent fixtures, a spell that continues over the month ahead. \n Their next four opponents score just two in the  Fixture Difficulty Rankings  (FDR). \n Southampton's next four Gameweeks \n \n \n \n GW \n Opponent \n FDR \n \n \n \n \n 8 \n NEW (H) \n 2 \n \n \n 9 \n WBA (H) \n 2 \n \n \n 10 \n BHA (A) \n 2 \n \n \n 11 \n BUR (H) \n 2 \n \n \n \n That run begins with  Newcastle United , who arrive at St Mary\u2019s Stadium on Sunday having scored once in three away trips.

We want to be that organisation: open to all and wanting to work with all to help those communities do things differently. \n \"So we are very grateful for the support of the Premier League to make that happen.\" \n",

    "text": "\n In the last of a five-part series on players who shaped the Premier League, adapted from his book, \"The Mixer\", Michael Cox looks at the impact made by  Manchester United  forward  Cristiano Ronaldo . \n Ronaldo transformation \n While Cristiano Ronaldo would become just the second Premier League player to win the Ballon d\u2019Or in 2008 \u2013 following  Michael Owen \u2019s triumph seven years beforehand \u2013 it\u2019s worth remembering that the Portuguese winger was mocked by many in his first campaign in English football. \n He wowed Manchester United fans with his trickery on debut against Bolton Wanderers, but was then criticised for his showboating and his tendency to go to ground. \n But 2006 was the turning point. After his involvement in the sending off of club-mate\u00a0 Wayne Rooney  at the FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo was supposed to be public enemy number one upon his return to England. \n Instead, he improved beyond anyone\u2019s expectations, particularly in a physical sense, and spent the next two years impressing crowds up and down the country with his directness and relentless thirst for goals. He won the PFA and FWA Player of the Year in both 2006/07 and 2007/08, and took Manchester United to the European Cup too. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n His astonishing improvement was most evident in his goalscoring return \u2013 from 18 Premier League goals combined in his first three seasons, Ronaldo then hit 66 in his next three. His 31 goals in 2007/08 remains a joint-record total for a 38-match campaign. \n In part, this was because he was essentially given freedom from defensive responsibilities by  Sir Alex Ferguson , turning from a right-winger to more of a left-sided attacker \u2013 and, at times, an outright centre-forward. \n \"All the premeditated tactical theories I had learned about getting into shape and tracking back with your runner, all the things that had been drummed into me, were thrown out over two years because we had a player who could make up his own rules with the blessing of his team-mates,\" said  Gary Neville . \"Ronaldo has helped to redefine the game.\" \n See:  Michael Cox's The Mixer \n Also in this series\u00a0 \n Part 1:  Peter Schmeichel \n Part 2:  Eric Cantona \n Part 3:  Nicolas Anelka \n Part 4:  Claude Makelele \n",

    "text": "\n The Scout names the first of five  Fantasy Premier League  players tipped for big points in Gameweek 8. \n Harry Maguire (LEI) \u00a35.1m \n This could be the time to swoop for Maguire. \n Leicester City \u2019s fixture schedule eases considerably, and the centre-back is poised to shine as an FPL option. \n Despite facing  Arsenal ,  Manchester United ,  Chelsea  and  Liverpool  over the opening seven Gameweeks, the defender has still tallied 33 points. \n He has been ever present in a Foxes backline that earned clean sheets in two of the other three fixtures, against  Brighton & Hove Albion  and at  AFC Bournemouth  last time out. \n Maguire\u2019s next opponents are\u00a0 West Bromwich Albion \u00a0(H). \n The Baggies have struggled as an attacking force this season. \n Tony Pulis\u2019 side have scored six goals from their seven matches. Their 68 shots is the fourth-lowest in the Premier League. \n While they remain a big threat at set-plays, West Brom have also shown their own weakness in the air. \n No defence has conceded more headed attempts (23) so far this season. \n And Maguire could exploit that frailty. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mute \n \n \n Play/Pause \n \n \n Close \n Back to top \n \n \n \n \n \n The Foxes have already scored four goals from corner situations, more than any other side. \n Maguire has been a key weapon in this respect, earning a goal and two assists so far. \n The towering centre-back also boasts the potential for bonus points. \n Maguire leads the Leicester ranks for clearances, blocks and interceptions (CBI) on 59, a key metric in the  Bonus Points System  (BPS). \n His passing ability is also a factor. \n Maguire has attempted more passes (228) than any other Foxes player, completing 78.6%. \n That has helped him to 18 points in the BPS for pass completion, eight more than any team-mate. \n After their testing start to the campaign, seven of Leicester\u2019s next 11 opponents score two or less in the  Fixture Difficulty Rankings  (FDR). \n Their major tests over this spell, against  Manchester City \u00a0and  Tottenham Hotspur , both arrive at the King Power Stadium. \n That schedule promises to promote interest in Maguire, who is part of only 7.0% of squads. \n He is an FPL defender likely to be favoured for bonus points when a clean sheet is secured, while also providing a goal threat at set-plays. \n Also in this series\u00a0 \n Part 2:  Virgil van Dijk \n Part 3:  Raheem Sterling \n Part 4:  Pascal Gross \n Part 5:  Alexis Sanchez \n",

Away from home, his 38 shots and 18 shots on target are both among the top two players in FPL this season. \n Jack Grealish  (\u00a36.7m), meanwhile, has produced double-figure hauls in each of  Aston Villa 's away matches at\u00a0 Burnley  and  Brighton & Hove Albion . \n The Villa playmaker will look to continue his strong form on the road at\u00a0 AFC Bournemouth , who have lost five of their last seven matches.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n What the experts say \n Ben McNair  ( @drbenmcnair ): \u00a0 Salah  will be a popular option and rightly so. He looks nailed-on to start, which is more than we can say for alternatives like  Sergio Aguero  (\u00a312.0m). For those looking for a risky differential, Grealish is enticing.   Holly Shand  ( @FFCommunity_ ):\u00a0It's set to be a tough week for captaincy, but I think I've settled on  Salah . He's been excellent at home this season and Anfield is an absolute fortress for Liverpool. \n Sam Bonfield  ( @FPLFamily ): There is one standout choice on paper:\u00a0 Salah  at home to Southampton. Saints have been excellent lately and are proving much more solid defensively. However, I think with the Mane injury, Salah will be the main focus of Liverpool's attack and I expect them to score. It's likely Salah will have a hand in the goals. \n Paul Gee  ( @FplPaulGee ):  Salah  is going to be the easy pick this week. He continues to get loads of chances and with Mane likely out it's an obvious choice. A differential captain could be Aguero, but personally I like to captain him at home. \n Lee Bonfield  ( @FPL Family ):\u00a0Over the last few weeks, I feel like I've done a lot of overthinking in FPL, including taking a hit for Mane Triple Captain! This week, I'm keeping it simple.  Salah 's in form and at Anfield where he tends to flourish. Saints' away form is good, but Liverpool's home form is imperious. \n Also in this series\u00a0 \n Part 2:  GW25 Captains: Aguero has shot at top pick \n",

He will be handed the captain's armband on his return to the Panel team. \n The experts do not have enough money in the bank to make a straight swap to Salah, so will use their second free transfer to replace\u00a0 Calgar Soyuncu  (\u00a35.0m) of  Leicester City  with  Manchester United 's cut-price left-back\u00a0 Brandon Williams  (\u00a34.1m) in defence. \n Leicester have had only one clean sheet since Gameweek 16 and face  Chelsea ,  Wolverhampton Wanderers  and Man City next. All three opponents currently lie in the top seven of the Premier League table. \n Join in and take them on \n The panel's team dropped to 632,851 in the overall standings and are ranked 18,934 out of 50,632 in the \" Beat the FPL Panel \" mini-league. \n The league remains the second best in the world, with the top five teams averaging an impressive 1,556.8 points. \n Andrew Burguiere ends Khaled Talaat's five-Gameweek stint at the top.

I was shocked to see  Nick Pope \u00a0of  Burnley  available in some leagues and either would be a great long-term option. \n DEF: Kyle Walker-Peters (SOU) \n I was excited about Walker-Peters when Mauricio Pochettino was playing him early in the season at Spurs. Now that he's the presumptive starter at  Southampton , I'm back on board. \n MID: Steven Bergwijn (TOT) \n Spurs' new midfielder\u00a0has great potential even if he faces strong competition for his place. If his transfer to\u00a0 Manchester United  goes through, though, Bruno Fernandes will be the best option of all. He'll get more playing time than Bergwijn and is a highly exciting attacking midfielder. \n FWD: Gabriel Martinelli (ARS) \n The young  Arsenal  forward has scored in back-to-back matches against  Sheffield United  and  Chelsea . If he can keep his place now that  Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang \u00a0has returned from suspension, Martinelli has some great fixtures to take advantage of. \n Clearly, there are more moves to be made but they'll likely not be available until the next waiver period so good luck with these priorities heading into the weekend. \n",

When given an inch, he knocks the ball forward and surges past opponents. \n Traore has also emerged as the Premier League's best dribbler in 2019/20, as the table below shows.\u00a0 \n Powering past people more than anyone else, he breaks the lines quite brilliantly for  Nuno Espirito Santo 's side. \n Top five dribblers 2019/20 \n \n \n \n Player \n Dribbles completed \n Success rate % \n \n \n \n \n Traore \n 131 \n 70.81 \n \n \n Zaha \n 119 \n 54.34 \n \n \n Buendia \n 78 \n 64.46 \n \n \n Pepe \n 61 \n 55.45 \n \n \n Anderson \n 57 \n 66.28 \n \n \n \n The former Barcelona,  Aston Villa  and  Middlesbrough  starlet has also improved his crossing this term. \n Jimenez is the biggest beneficiary of this change and five of his 11 goals in 2019/20 have come from Traore assists. \n Traore sets up Jimenez v Liverpool \n \n Producing three times more open-play crosses than any other player at Molineux, Traore is second only to  Liverpool' s  Trent Alexander-Arnold  in deliveries made. \n Indeed, the Spaniard's success rate is even higher than\u00a0  Manchester City 's\u00a0 Kevin De Bruyne , who is on course to break the single-season assists record. \n Most prolific crossers 2019/20 \n \n \n \n Player \n Open play crosses \n Success rate % \n \n \n \n \n Alexander-Arnold \n 150 \n 14.67 \n \n \n Traore \n 126 \n 20.63 \n \n \n De Bruyne \n 115 \n 19.13 \n \n \n Robertson \n 102 \n 18.63 \n \n \n Digne \n 99 \n 19.19 \n \n \n \n Gaining the confidence of his head coach has made a tremendous difference to the powerful attacker. \n Last season Traore averaged 30.8 minutes per appearance, with the bulk of his match minutes coming from the bench.\u00a0 \n By contrast, he has started in 20 of his 23 appearances this term, and averaged 80.5 minutes per match. \n Remarkably, 22 Premier League players have registered faster top speeds than the Wolves man this season.\u00a0 \n He is only the sixth-quickest forward. \n Quickest forwards 2019/20 \n \n \n \n Player \n Top speed (km/h) \n \n \n \n \n Long\u00a0 \n 37.35 \n \n \n Sarr\u00a0 \n 36.90 \n \n \n Saint-Maximin\u00a0 \n 36.76 \n \n \n Jesus\u00a0 \n 36.69 \n \n \n Rashford\u00a0 \n 36.32 \n \n \n Traore\u00a0 \n 36.20 \n \n \n \n A key factor in Traore's emergence as a key player this season has been his intelligent use of the ball and improved movement off it. \n Making smarter decisions, slowing down at the right moments and knowing when and where to use his blistering turn of speed are qualities he has in abundance. \n Traore now plays with confidence, is pivotal to the team's tactics and has been one of the players of the season so far. \n Also in this series \n Part 1:  Sheffield United in safe hands with Henderson Part 2:  Grealish relishing responsibility of being Villa's talisman \n",
