        "summary": "Gary James Cahill (born 19 December 1985) is an English former professional footballer who played as a centre-back.\nCahill began his career playing for the AFC Dronfield youth system in Derbyshire. In 2000, he joined the Aston Villa Academy and continued his development. In 2004, he joined Burnley on a season-long loan, where he performed well before returning to make his Aston Villa debut. Later, he signed for hometown club Sheffield United on a three-month loan deal. On 30 January 2008, he signed for Bolton Wanderers for around \u00a35 million. Cahill performed well for Bolton through the years, cementing a place in the first team. He made 130 league appearances and scored 13 league goals for Bolton. In January 2012, Cahill signed for Chelsea for approximately \u00a37 million. He won the UEFA Champions League in his debut season at Chelsea, and went on to win the UEFA Europa League twice, the Premier League twice, the FA Cup twice and the League Cup. Following his release in 2019, Cahill joined fellow London club Crystal Palace on a free transfer. He left the club after two seasons in 2021.\nCahill is a former England international with over 60 caps, and represented the nation in England tournament squads for the FIFA World Cups of 2014 and 2018, and the UEFA European Championship in 2012 and 2016, though he withdrew injured from the 2012 event. He was eligible to play for either England or the Republic of Ireland, but chose to play for England. In June 2009, Cahill was called up to the England squad for the match against Kazakhstan; however, he only made his debut on 3 September 2010, coming on as a substitute against Bulgaria. He made his first start for the national team on 29 March 2011, in the friendly against Ghana. He scored his first international goal against Bulgaria, in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier.\n\n",

He was previously captain of Chelsea, the England national team and Aston Villa. He is regarded as one of the greatest defenders of his generation, as well as one of the best English and Premier League defenders ever.Terry was named UEFA Club Defender of the Year in 2005, 2008 and 2009, PFA Players' Player of the Year in 2005, and was included in the FIFPro World XI for five consecutive seasons, from 2005 to 2009. He was also named in the all-star squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the only English player to make the team.\nTerry is Chelsea's most successful captain. During his 19 years with the club, he led them to five Premier League titles, five FA Cups, three League Cups, one UEFA Europa League and one UEFA Champions League title. He is one of six players to have made over 500 appearances for Chelsea and is also the club's all-time highest scoring defender. In 2007, he became the first captain to lift the FA Cup at the new Wembley Stadium in Chelsea's 1\u20130 win over Manchester United, and also the first player to score an international goal there, scoring a header in England's 1\u20131 draw with Brazil. In his final season at Chelsea in 2017, he became the first ever player to captain a team to the Premier League title on five occasions.\nFollowing his departure from Chelsea, Terry spent one season with Aston Villa in the Championship before retiring, ultimately losing the 2018 Championship play-off final. He returned to Aston Villa a few months later as assistant manager to Dean Smith. The side went on to win the 2019 Championship play-off final to be promoted back to the Premier League. Terry left the role in July 2021. When Smith joined Leicester City as manager in April 2023, he appointed Terry to his coaching staff once again.",

He has also been deployed as a wing-back at times during his career.\nMoses began his career in the Championship with Crystal Palace, before his performances caught the eye of Wigan Athletic, where he made his Premier League debut in 2010. After two years, his game had improved to the extent that European champions Chelsea were interested, and he signed for them in the summer of 2012. Despite ten goals in all competitions during his first season, he spent his second season on loan to Liverpool, his third on loan at Stoke City and his fourth on loan at West Ham United. Moses was recalled to Chelsea for the 2016\u201317 season where he made 34 appearances as Chelsea won the Premier League. After failing to impress during the next campaign, Moses spent subsequent loan spells with Fenerbah\u00e7e, Inter Milan and Spartak Moscow in the following seasons.\nBorn in Nigeria, Moses represented England youth teams at under-16, under-17, under-19 and under-21 levels, but opted to play for Nigeria as opposed to being fully capped for England. He made his debut for the Nigerian senior team in 2012 and earned 38 caps and scored 12 times before retiring from international matches in 2018. He played in Nigeria's winning campaign at the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, as well as the campaign in the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\n",

        "summary": "Eden Michael Walter Hazard (born 7 January 1991) is a Belgian former professional footballer who played as a winger or attacking midfielder for Lille, Chelsea, Real Madrid, and the Belgium national team. Known for his creativity, dribbling, passing and vision, Hazard is regarded as one of the best players of his generation.Hazard began his senior career with Ligue 1 club Lille in 2007 at the age of 16 and soon became an integral part of the Lille team under manager Rudi Garcia. In his first full season, he became the first non-French player to win the Ligue 1 Young Player of the Year award, and the following season became the first player to win the award twice. In the 2010\u201311 season, he won the league and cup double and, as a result of his performances, was named the Ligue 1 Player of the Year, the youngest player to win the award.\nAfter making over 190 appearances and scoring 50 goals for Lille, Hazard signed for English club Chelsea in June 2012. He won the UEFA Europa League in his first season and the PFA Young Player of the Year in his second. In the 2014\u201315 season, Hazard helped Chelsea win the Football League Cup and Premier League, earning him the FWA Footballer of the Year and the PFA Players' Player of the Year awards. Two years later he won his second English league title as Chelsea won the 2016\u201317 Premier League. In 2018, he won the FA Cup, and was named in the FIFA FIFPRO Men's World 11. He won the Europa League again with Chelsea in 2019, scoring twice in the final. At Chelsea, Hazard established himself as one of the best players in the world. He joined Real Madrid in the summer of 2019 in a transfer worth up to \u20ac150 million, making it one of the highest transfer fees ever. However, injury woes, subpar performances, and a lack of fitness led to him only playing a limited number of games, departing the club in June 2023 and retiring from professional football four months later.\nHaving represented his country at various youth levels, Hazard made his senior debut for the Belgium national team in November 2008, aged 17. He has since earned over 126 caps, and was a member of the Belgian squad which reached the quarter-finals of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2016, and Euro 2020. At the 2018 World Cup, he captained Belgium to third place which was their best finish in history, receiving the Silver Ball as the second-best player of the tournament. From 2015 to 2022, he served as the captain of the team, including the time Belgium topped the FIFA men's ranking for the first time, which became the longest continuous reign of any European team.\n\n",

He never played for the club but spent time on loan at Penafiel, and signed with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid the following year. Over the next two seasons he had loan periods with Braga, Celta Vigo and Albacete. His form earned him a move to fellow La Liga club Real Valladolid in 2009, where he spent one season, finishing as their top goalscorer, before returning to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Costa struggled to maintain a regular starting role with Atl\u00e9tico, and spent more time on loan, this time at Rayo Vallecano, where he finished as the club's highest scorer that season.\nIn 2011 Costa returned to Atl\u00e9tico with a greater role. He blossomed as a goalscorer, and helped the team win a La Liga title, a Copa del Rey title, and a UEFA Super Cup. His performances attracted the attention of several big clubs, and in 2014 Costa was transferred to Premier League club Chelsea in a deal worth \u20ac35 million (\u00a332 million). In London, Costa won three trophies, including two Premier League titles, and a League Cup. In 2018, following a rift with head coach Antonio Conte, Costa returned to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in a club record transfer worth an initial \u20ac56 million, where he won a UEFA Europa League title and another UEFA Super Cup.\nCosta is a dual citizen of Brazil and Spain. He played twice for Brazil in 2013, before declaring his desire to represent Spain, having been granted Spanish citizenship in September that year. He made his debut for Spain in March 2014, and has since won 24 caps and scored 10 goals, and has represented them at the 2014 and 2018 FIFA World Cups.\nKnown for his fiery temperament, Costa has been criticised and punished for several confrontations with opponents.",

In 2006, he moved up to the Premier League with Manchester City, having attracted the attention of several other top-flight teams. In his first season, he spent time on loan at Tranmere Rovers and Blackpool. Hart had a loan spell with Birmingham City in the 2009\u201310 season, during which he was nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year and was voted as the Premier League goalkeeper of the season in recognition of his performances. He returned to Manchester City for the 2010\u201311 season and won the Golden Glove for keeping the most clean sheets throughout the Premier League season. Hart replicated this feat in the 2011\u201312 season as Manchester City won the Premier League title. He won the Golden Glove for the third year in a row the following season, and won again in 2012\u201313 for his fourth in five years. In between, Hart won a second Premier League title with Manchester City in 2013\u201314. With over 100 Premier League clean sheets, Hart holds the joint record for the most Premier League Golden Glove awards (four).\nWith the arrival of new manager Pep Guardiola at Manchester City in 2016, Hart became the second-choice goalkeeper and made only one appearance in the Champions League before moving on loan to Torino and West Ham United in successive seasons. In August 2018, he moved to Burnley on a permanent transfer after injuries to the club's two regular goalkeepers. When they returned from injury, Hart again found himself in the role of backup and he left the club at the end of his contract in June 2020. In August 2020, Hart signed with Tottenham Hotspur on a two-year deal. A year later, he signed for Scottish Premiership side Celtic.\nA former regular for England at Under-21 level, Hart made his senior international debut in June 2008, and was recognised as England's first-choice goalkeeper from 2010 to 2017. He has gained 75 caps since his debut in 2008, keeping 43 clean sheets and was selected in England's squads for two FIFA World Cups and two UEFA European Championships.\n\n",

        "summary": "Sergio Leonel Ag\u00fcero del Castillo (born 2 June 1988), also known as Kun Ag\u00fcero, is an Argentine former professional footballer who played as a striker. He is considered one of the best strikers of his generation and one of the greatest players in the history of the Premier League, during his decade-long association with Manchester City. He is the club's all-time top goalscorer and holds the record for most Premier League hat-tricks, with 12.\nAg\u00fcero began his career at the Argentine club Independiente where, on 5 July 2003, he became the youngest player to play in the Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n at 15 years and 35 days, breaking the 27 year record previously set by Diego Maradona. In 2006, Ag\u00fcero moved to La Liga club Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in a transfer worth \u20ac23 million, establishing himself as one of the world's best young players and one of the most prolific players in La Liga, winning the Don Bal\u00f3n, the Golden Boy, and the World Soccer Young Player of the Year. Ag\u00fcero also won the UEFA Europa League and the UEFA Super Cup while in Madrid.\nAg\u00fcero signed for Premier League club Manchester City in 2011 in a transfer for a reported fee of \u00a335 million. During his 10 years at the club, he won five league titles, notably scoring a last minute winner in the final league game of his debut season to win the club its first league title in 44 years. Further honours with the club include a record six EFL Cups and an FA Cup; he was also part of the club's first UEFA Champions League final. Ag\u00fcero won a Premier League Golden Boot and was twice included in the PFA Team of the Year. He is the fifth all-time Premier League goalscorer and the highest non-English scorer in the competition, with 184 goals. He held the record for the most Premier League goals scored by a player for any single club until it was overtaken by Harry Kane in 2022. In 2021, he joined Barcelona on a free transfer, before retiring from football aged 33 due to heart problems in the same year. He played just four matches for the club, with his only goal coming in the first El Cl\u00e1sico of the 2021\u201322 season.\nAt international level, Ag\u00fcero represented the Argentina under-20 team as they won the 2005 and 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cups. He played at the 2008 Olympics, scoring two goals in the semi-final against Brazil as Argentina won gold. Ag\u00fcero is Argentina's third-highest all-time top goalscorer and has earned over 100 caps, representing the senior team at three FIFA World Cups (in 2010, 2014 and 2018) and five Copas Am\u00e9rica (in 2011, 2015, 2016, 2019 and 2021), winning the Copa Am\u00e9rica in 2021.\n\n",

Iheanacho was instrumental in Leicester City's 2020\u201321 FA Cup success, scoring a joint-high four goals across the edition as the club won the trophy for the first time. He also scored the match's sole goal from the penalty spot as Leicester lifted the 2021 FA Community Shield.\nAt international level, Iheanacho represented Nigeria's under-17 team at the 2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup, being named the tournament's best player and finishing as the second-highest goalscorer as he led the side to their record fourth title. He would then be included in Nigeria's under-20 team for the 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup, before making his senior international debut later that same year. Since then, he has represented the country at the 2018 FIFA World Cup and the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. Iheanacho was elected the Most Promising African Talent twice in 2013 and 2016, also being named as a substitute for the CAF Team of the Year in 2016.",

After excelling at the club for three seasons, Lloris moved to seven-time Ligue 1 champions Olympique Lyonnais, amid interest from several other clubs, notably Milan. Lloris won several domestic awards in his first season with Lyon and, in his second season, earned award nominations for his performances in the UEFA Champions League, which saw Lyon reach the semi-finals for the first time. He joined Tottenham in 2012, and helped the team reach the Champions League final in 2019.\nLloris was a French international having represented his nation at under-18, under-19, and under-21 level.

FC K\u00f6ln in June 2012. In the 2013\u201314 season, Wimmer helped K\u00f6ln set a new 2. Bundesliga record, conceding only 20 goals as they earned promotion to the Bundesliga. After a solid first season in the German top flight he moved to Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of \u00a34.3 million. However his playing time under Mauricio Pochettino at White Hart Lane was restricted due to the form of Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen. After two seasons in North London, Wimmer joined Stoke City in August 2017 for a fee of \u00a318 million. He struggled for game time at Stoke and joined Hannover 96 on loan for the 2018\u201319 season, Belgian side Royal Excel Mouscron in 2019\u201320 and Karlsruher SC in 2020\u201321.",

        "summary": "Harry Edward Kane  (born 28 July 1993) is an English professional footballer who plays as a striker for Bundesliga club Bayern Munich and captains the England national team. A prolific goalscorer with strong link play, Kane is regarded as one of the best players in the world and one of the best strikers of his generation. He is both Tottenham Hotspur's and England's all-time highest goalscorer, as well as being the second-highest all-time goalscorer in the Premier League. Kane has scored over 350 goals for club and country.\nBeginning his senior career with Tottenham Hotspur in 2009, Kane had loan spells out to clubs across the English football pyramid, including Leyton Orient, Millwall, Leicester City, and Norwich City. Kane's involvement at Tottenham increased after Mauricio Pochettino became head coach in 2014, and in his first full season at the club he was named PFA Young Player of the Year. In the 2015\u201316 and 2016\u201317 seasons, Kane finished as the league's top goalscorer. In the latter campaign, he helped Tottenham finish as Premier League runners-up and was named PFA Fans' Player of the Year. Kane registered his best campaign statistically to date in the 2017\u201318 season, with 41 goals scored in 48 games across all competitions, and in the following season, he finished as a runner-up in the UEFA Champions League. He ended the 2020\u201321 season as the league's top goalscorer and top assist provider. In 2023, Kane became the most expensive signing in Bundesliga history, costing \u20ac110 million, as he signed for Bayern Munich.\nKane has scored 62 goals in 89 appearances for England. He appeared more than 30 times at youth international level and made a goalscoring debut with the senior team in March 2015, at age 21. Kane featured and scored during England's successful UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying campaign, and represented the country at the tournament. He was named England captain just before the 2018 FIFA World Cup, in which he finished as the competition's top goalscorer, winning the Golden Boot, leading England to fourth place, their highest finish since 1990. He led England to the runner-up position at UEFA Euro 2020, marking their first appearance in a final at the tournament and their first major final since 1966.\n\n",

        "summary": "Petr \u010cech (Czech pronunciation: [\u02c8p\u025btr\u0329 \u02c8t\u0283\u025bx] ; born 20 May 1982) is a Czech former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He now plays ice hockey as a goaltender for Belfast Giants, on loan from Oxford City Stars. He has been described as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, and as one of the best in Premier League history.\u010cech began his senior career at Chmel Bl\u0161any in 1999, where he played sporadically for two seasons prior to relocating to Sparta Prague in 2001. At age 19, \u010cech became a first team regular, and his single campaign with the club saw him register a league record of not conceding a goal in 903 competitive minutes. This led to his first move abroad, when he relocated to France to join Ligue 1 side Rennes for a fee of \u20ac5.5 million (\u00a33.9 million) in 2002.\nIn France, \u010cech starred in an under-performing team, and was the subject of a then club-record transfer for a goalkeeper when he moved to Premier League side Chelsea for a fee of \u00a37 million (\u20ac9.8 million) in 2004. In his eleven-year spell at Chelsea, \u010cech made 494 appearances in all competitions, making him the club's seventh most capped player of all time. He also helped the club win four Premier League titles, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one UEFA Champions League title, and one UEFA Europa League title. \u010cech also holds Chelsea's all-time record for clean sheets, with 228. \u010cech departed Chelsea in 2015 to join city rivals Arsenal for a fee of \u00a310 million, where he won another FA Cup before retiring in 2019.\nA Czech international, \u010cech made his debut with the Czech Republic in 2002, and is the most capped player in the history of the Czech national team, with 124 caps. He represented his country at the 2006 World Cup, as well as the 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 European Championships. He was voted into the Euro 2004 All-Star team after helping the Czechs reach the semi-finals, and served as the team's captain, prior to retiring from international competition in 2016. \u010cech also holds the record for the most Czech Footballer of the Year and Czech Golden Ball wins. \n\u010cech holds a number of goalkeeping records, including the Premier League record for fewest appearances required to reach 100 clean sheets, having done so in 180 appearances, the most clean sheets in a season (24), as well as the record for the most clean sheets in Premier League history (202). \u010cech is also the only goalkeeper to have won the Premier League Golden Glove with two separate clubs, and has won it a joint record four times; in the 2004\u201305, 2009\u201310, 2013\u201314 and the 2015\u201316 seasons. He was voted the IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper in 2005, received the award of Best Goalkeeper in the 2004\u201305, 2006\u201307 and 2007\u201308 editions of the UEFA Champions League, and went 1,025 minutes without conceding a goal in the 2004\u201305 season, a league record. He has the third most clean sheets since 2000 among all goalkeepers.",

        "summary": "Laurent Koscielny (born 10 September 1985) is a French former professional footballer who played as a centre back.Born in Tulle, Koscielny began his football career playing for a host of youth clubs before moving to Guingamp in 2003, where he quickly progressed through the youth ranks, making his professional debut the following season. After becoming frustrated at being played out of position as a right back, he joined Tours for an undisclosed fee, quickly establishing himself as the team's star player in his desired position, ultimately aiding in the club's promotion into Ligue 1, while also being named in the Ligue 2 Team of the Season. Koscielny continued his impressive performances following a \u20ac1.7 million transfer to fellow French outfit Lorient in 2009, receiving multiple plaudits for his performances, largely cultivating a reputation as a clever, agile, ball-playing defender. His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a38.45 million the following season.\nFollowing his arrival in England, Koscielny was regarded as one of the best players in his position in the Premier League. He had established himself as a core component in the Arsenal first team, as well as contributing with a host of individual performances, including aiding in ending the club's nine-year trophy drought, scoring a crucial equalizer en route to winning the FA Cup in 2014. He was also crucial in further club successes that followed, winning another FA Cup and the FA Community Shield twice.\nDespite qualifying to represent Poland, Koscielny instead decided to represent France, and first appeared up for the national team against Brazil in February 2011. Koscielny became a regular starter for the nation in every major tournament that they have appeared in, including UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup, while also leading France to the final of UEFA Euro 2016, which they lost to Portugal. He scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland in 2016, and amassed fifty-one appearances for the national side. He retired from international football in 2018.\n\n",

He is the current manager of the Arsenal Academy.Mertesacker began his senior career after being promoted from the youth ranks at Bundesliga club Hannover 96, making his senior league debut in November 2003. He was soon dubbed \"the Defence Pole\" (\"die Abwehrlatte\") by German tabloids, and gained a reputation for his exceptional disciplinary record, going 31 league games without being booked. After various standout performances at Hannover, as well as starring for the Germany national team at the 2006 FIFA World Cup at age 21, he transferred after 74 league matches for Hannover to fellow Bundesliga outfit Werder Bremen, for a fee of \u20ac5 million later that summer. His tenure at the club was characterized for his ability to read play and stifle the build-up play to opposition attacks, establishing himself as a defender with a quiet-but-effective game, and a core-component of the Bremen team that won the 2009 DFB-Pokal, and finished as runner-up in the 2009 UEFA Cup.\nAfter being singled out for praise for his performances at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, and with his contract at Bremen dwindling, he transferred to Premier League club Arsenal a year later, for a fee of \u00a38 million. At Arsenal, Mertesacker quickly established himself as the first-choice centre back for the club, becoming a mainstay despite sharing several defensive partners over his first two seasons. He eventually built up a solid relationship with fellow defender Laurent Koscielny, and the duo would star as Arsenal ended their nine-year trophy drought by winning the 2014 FA Cup. He would later captain and score for the side in their retention of the trophy a year later, before becoming the club's outright captain in 2016. He would again star in his third victory of the trophy in 2017. However, injuries derailed the latter stages of his career at Arsenal, and was used sparingly during his final two seasons, being forced to retire in 2018.\nAt national level, Mertesacker played for Germany at the under-20 and under-21 levels, prior to debuting for the senior side in 2004 against Iran. Upon his debut, Mertesacker established himself as Germany's first-choice centre back for ten years, participating in UEFA European Championship in 2008 and 2012, as well as the 2006, 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, winning the latter. He would retire from international competition following this win.Mertesacker has developed other ventures, including the \"Per Mertesacker Stiftung\", a charitable foundation that helps support amateur sportsmen, and the poor. He would transition into coaching following his retirement, taking charge of the Arsenal Academy.",

        "summary": "Aaron James Ramsey (born 26 December 1990) is a Welsh professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for EFL Championship club Cardiff City and captains the Wales national team. Ramsey mainly plays as a box-to-box midfielder, but has also been deployed on the left and right wings.\nHe played as a schoolboy for Cardiff City, where he spent eight years in youth football, became the club's youngest ever first team player, and made 28 appearances (including loan spell) for the senior team \u2013 including the 2008 FA Cup Final. Ramsey moved to Arsenal in 2008 in a \u00a35 million deal, where he quickly gained first-team experience. However, his career stalled significantly after he suffered a broken leg in a match against Stoke City in February 2010. After two loan spells away from Arsenal, he returned to full fitness and re-established himself as a regular starter during the 2011\u201312 season. He also represented Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Ramsey was a key player for Arsenal in the 2013\u201314 campaign, scoring 16 goals in all competitions, including the winner in the 2014 FA Cup Final against Hull City. He also played in the 2015 FA Cup Final, which Arsenal won, and scored a second FA Cup winning goal in 2017. On 1 July 2019, he joined Juventus after having signed a pre-contractual agreement, winning the league title during his first season. In 2022, he joined French side Nice. On the 15 July 2023, Ramsey re-joined Cardiff City after his contract with Nice was terminated by mutual consent.\nRamsey made his full international debut for Wales in 2008 and was part of their UEFA Euro 2016 campaign, where he helped his country to the semi-finals and was included in the Team of the Tournament. He was instrumental in securing qualification for UEFA Euro 2020, the country's second successive European tournament, and at the delayed tournament, Wales made it to the last 16. Ramsey was also a member of the squad that qualified for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, becoming the first team to do so since 1958, which he described as a \"dream come true\".",

A former Spanish international, Cazorla operates primarily as an attacking midfielder, but also plays as a winger, central midfielder or as a deep-lying playmaker.\nCazorla began his professional career at Villarreal in 2003 after impressing as a youngster with Oviedo, his hometown club. He continued his development at Villarreal before a short spell at partner club, Recreativo de Huelva. He was Recreativo Huelva's standout player in the 2006\u201307 La Liga season, contributing to their top-ten finish and being awarded Spain's Footballer of the Year. He returned to Villarreal for \u20ac1.2 million the following season, becoming a key contributor to the side, regularly being named in the La Liga Team of the Season. In 2011, Cazorla moved to M\u00e1laga in a club-record \u20ac21 million deal, where he gained a reputation for his speed, shooting accuracy, capacity to change the rhythm of gameplay, and excellent close control.After the 2011\u201312 season, coupled with M\u00e1laga's perilous financial situation, Cazorla moved to Premier League side Arsenal for a fee of \u00a310 million, where he became a core component to the team in his first year at the club, registering thirteen assists, after which he was voted Arsenal Player of the Season, as well as becoming ranked one of the best footballers in Europe. Cazorla was integral in ending the club's nine-year trophy drought, scoring a crucial free-kick en route to winning the FA Cup final in 2014. Injuries plagued his latter years with Arsenal.

Known for his technical skills, creativity, passing skills, and vision, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest midfielders and playmakers of his generation. He could also play as a wide midfielder.\nBorn and raised in Gelsenkirchen, \u00d6zil began his senior club career playing for hometown club Schalke 04, before signing with Werder Bremen in 2008, aged 19. After winning the DFB-Pokal in his first season, his individual performances led to a move to Real Madrid in 2010. There, he helped the club win a La Liga title, and ranked first in league assists for three straight seasons. In 2013, \u00d6zil was the subject of a then-club record association football transfer when he signed for Arsenal in a transfer worth up to \u00a342.5 million (\u20ac50 million), becoming the most expensive German player ever at the time. In England, he won three FA Cups and helped end Arsenal's nine-year trophy drought, while recording the second most assists ever (19) in a Premier League season. In 2021, \u00d6zil joined Fenerbah\u00e7e on a free transfer; after his contract with the club was terminated in 2022, he signed with \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir, before retiring in 2023.\nA German international for over nine years, \u00d6zil holds the record for the most German National Team Player of the Year awards (5). He made his senior debut for the Germany national team in 2009 at age 20, and appeared in five major tournaments. He was the top assist provider at the 2010 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012, where he helped Germany twice reach the semi-final. \u00d6zil helped Germany win the 2014 FIFA World Cup, but retired from international competition in 2018, alleging discrimination and disrespect by the German Football Association (DFB) and the German media.",

He is currently a free agent.\nBorn in Madrid and raised in nearby Illescas, De Gea began his playing career with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, rising through the academy system at the club before making his senior debut in 2009, aged 18. After being made Atl\u00e9tico's first-choice goalkeeper, he helped the team win the UEFA Europa League and the UEFA Super Cup in 2010. His performances subsequently attracted the attention of Manchester United, and De Gea joined the club in 2011 for \u00a318.9 million, a British record for a goalkeeper at the time.\nIn his time at Manchester United, De Gea made over 500 appearances and won a Premier League title, an FA Cup, two League Cups, three Community Shields and the UEFA Europa League. For three consecutive seasons from 2013\u201314 to 2015\u201316, he was elected as United's Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year, the first player in the award's history to win on three successive occasions (four in total), as well as being included in four consecutive (five in total) PFA Team of the Year sides from 2015 to 2018. In 2018, he was named in the FIFA FIFPro World11. De Gea left United following the expiration of his contract in 2023.\nTipped by many as the successor to Iker Casillas as Spain's long-term goalkeeper, De Gea was the captain for the Spain under-21 national team that won the European Championship in 2011 and 2013, and also competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics. He made his debut for the senior team in 2014 and was selected for that year's World Cup. De Gea was named as Spain's starting goalkeeper for the 2016 European Championship and the 2018 FIFA World Cup, receiving criticism for his performance in the latter. He lost his regular place to Unai Sim\u00f3n for UEFA Euro 2020.\n\n",

        "summary": "Michael Carrick (born 28 July 1981) is an English professional football coach and former player who is currently the head coach of Championship club Middlesbrough. He is one of the most decorated English footballers of all time and is best known for his 12-year playing career with Manchester United, whom he also captained. Carrick was a central midfielder, but he was used as an emergency centre-back under Alex Ferguson, David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. His playing style was grounded in his passing ability.Carrick began his career at West Ham United, joining the youth team in 1997 and winning the FA Youth Cup two years later. He was sent on loan twice during his debut season, to Swindon Town and Birmingham City, before securing a place in the first team by the 2000\u201301 season. He experienced relegation in the 2002\u201303 season and was voted into the PFA First Division Team of the Year in the following campaign. He made more than 150 appearances for the Hammers, and in 2004, he moved to rival London club Tottenham Hotspur for a fee believed to be \u00a33.5 million. He played an influential role at the club for two seasons before moving to Manchester United in 2006 for \u00a314 million.\nFrom his debut onwards, Carrick was a regular in the Manchester United first team, making more than 50 appearances in his first season with them. He established himself as a key member of the team that won the Premier League in 2006\u201307, their first title success in four years. The following season he was part of the side that won the 2008 Champions League final, playing the full 120 minutes as they enjoyed a 6\u20135 penalty shootout win, with Carrick converting his spot kick, to help achieve the European Double. As of 2023, he is the only English player alongside former teammate Wayne Rooney to win the Premier League title, FA Cup, UEFA Champions League, League Cup, FA Community Shield, UEFA Europa League and FIFA Club World Cup. In winning the 2016 FA Cup, Carrick completed his collection of every domestic honour in the English game.Carrick has represented England at under-18, under-21, B and senior levels. He made his England debut in 2001 and went on to gain 34 caps without scoring a goal. Carrick was often overlooked during his England career, with many of his contemporaries being preferred in his position. This was the case until the 2012\u201313 season, when Carrick established himself as a regular. He was a member of the England squad for two major tournaments, the 2006 and 2010 World Cups.\n\n",

A versatile player, he operates primarily as a central midfielder, but can be deployed as a left winger, attacking midfielder, defensive midfielder and deep-lying playmaker.Born in Lagny-sur-Marne, Pogba joined the youth team of Ligue 2 side Le Havre in 2007, before a protracted transfer brought him to Manchester United two years later. After beginning his senior career with Manchester United two years later, limited appearances persuaded him to depart to join Italian side Juventus on a free transfer in 2012, where he helped the club to four consecutive Serie A titles, as well as two Coppa Italia and two Supercoppa Italiana titles. During his time in Italy, Pogba further established himself as one of the most promising young players in the world and received the Golden Boy award in 2013, followed by the Bravo Award in 2014. In 2016, Pogba was named to the 2015 UEFA Team of the Year and the 2015 FIFA FIFPro World XI after helping Juventus to the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final, their first in 12 years.\nPogba's performances at Juventus led to him returning to Manchester United in 2016 for a then-world record transfer fee of \u20ac105 million (\u00a389.3 million). The fee was the highest paid by an English club until 2021. In his first season back, he won the League Cup and the Europa League. In the 2018\u201319 season, he was named in the PFA Team of the Year.\nInternationally, Pogba captained France to victory at the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup and took home the award for the Best Player for his performances during the tournament. He made his debut for the senior team a year later and featured prominently at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, where he was awarded the Best Young Player Award for his performances.

        "summary": "Juan Manuel Mata Garc\u00eda (born 28 April 1988) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for J1 League club Vissel Kobe. He primarily plays as an attacking midfielder, but he can also play as a winger. \nA graduate of Real Madrid's youth academy, Mata played for Real Madrid Castilla in 2006\u201307, before joining Valencia in the summer of 2007. He became an integral part of the club's midfield, making 174 appearances over the course of four seasons and winning the Copa del Rey. In 2011, Mata signed for English club Chelsea for a fee believed to be in the region of \u20ac28 million and established himself as the team's focal player. In his first two seasons, he won the UEFA Champions League, the FA Cup, and the UEFA Europa League. \nDespite Mata's stature at the club, he fell out of favour at Chelsea under newly-appointed manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and was sold to Manchester United in January 2014, for a fee of \u00a337.1 million. He made 285 appearances over nine seasons at United, winning the Europa League and FA Cup again as well as the EFL Cup and FA Community Shield. He joined Galatasaray after his contract with United expired in the summer of 2022, where he won the first league title of his career. \nMata debuted for Spain in 2009 and played at the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, his first senior tournament. In September 2009, Mata scored his first goal for the senior team, against Estonia, securing the nation a place at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, and was part of Spain's World Cup-winning squad. In 2011, he resumed playing in the under-21 side, helping Spain win the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Championship in Denmark. He won the Golden Player award and was part of the Team of the Tournament. Mata returned to the senior squad for UEFA Euro 2012 and, after coming on as a substitute, scored Spain's fourth goal in the final as Spain defeated Italy 4\u20130 to retain their title as champions of Europe.\n\n",

        "summary": "Sadio Man\u00e9 (born 10 April 1992) is a Senegalese professional footballer who plays as a forward or winger for Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr and the Senegal national team. Known for his pressing, dribbling and speed, Man\u00e9 is often considered one of the greatest African players of all time.Man\u00e9 began his professional career with Ligue 2 club Metz at the age of 19, but he departed after a solitary season to join Austrian club Red Bull Salzburg in 2012 for a fee of \u20ac4 million, winning a league and cup domestic double in the 2013\u201314 season. Later that summer, Man\u00e9 transferred to English club Southampton for a club record fee of \u00a311.8 million. There, he set a new Premier League record for the fastest hat-trick, scored in 176 seconds in a 6\u20131 win over Aston Villa in 2015.\nMan\u00e9 signed for fellow Premier League club Liverpool in 2016, for a reported fee of \u00a334 million, making him the most expensive African player in history at that time. Having formed a formidable attacking trio with Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino after the departure of prolific midfielder Philippe Coutinho, he helped the side reach back-to-back UEFA Champions League Finals in 2018 and 2019, winning the latter. He also finished as the league's joint-top goalscorer in the 2018\u201319 season, winning the Premier League Golden Boot. Man\u00e9 then helped end Liverpool's 30-year league title drought by winning the 2019\u201320 Premier League. In October 2021, he scored his 100th Premier League goal, becoming the third African to reach the landmark. Man\u00e9 finished fourth and second in the 2019 and 2022 editions of the Ballon d'Or, respectively; and in The Best FIFA Men's Player he ranked fifth in 2019 and fourth in 2020.\nAt international level, Man\u00e9 has registered 38 goals in 99 appearances for Senegal since his debut in 2012, and currently ranks as his nation's all-time top goalscorer, and joint-second in all-time appearances. He represented Senegal at the 2012 Olympics, as well as the 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2021 editions of the Africa Cup of Nations. In the 2019 tournament, Man\u00e9 helped Senegal to a runners-up finish, and a year later, was named African Footballer of the Year. In the 2021 final, Man\u00e9 scored the winning kick in the penalty shoot-out to give Senegal their first Africa Cup of Nations title and he was also named the Player of the tournament. In 2022, he was crowned African Player of the Year for the second time. Man\u00e9 also represented his nation at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, in its second-ever appearance in the competition.\n\n",

        "summary": "Daniel Andre Sturridge (born 1 September 1989) is an English professional footballer who plays as a striker. He is currently a free agent. Since 2023, he has worked as a television pundit for Sky Sports.Sturridge was scouted by Aston Villa and played for a number of years in their younger academy sides before moving to Coventry City in 2002. He then signed for Manchester City in 2003. He continued his development at City and played in two FA Youth Cup finals. He made his first-team debut in the 2007\u201308 season, becoming the only player to score in the FA Youth Cup, FA Cup and Premier League in the same season. He left City in 2009 to sign for Chelsea, where he was loaned to Bolton Wanderers for the second half of the 2010\u201311 season. After a successful spell at Bolton, scoring eight goals in 12 appearances, he returned to Chelsea for the 2011\u201312 season.\nHe left Chelsea to join Liverpool in January 2013, where he formed an attacking partnership with Luis Su\u00e1rez. Liverpool scored more than 100 goals in the 2013\u201314 Premier League season with Sturridge scoring 21 goals, behind only Su\u00e1rez on 31. The following two seasons were curtailed by injuries, limiting Sturridge to very few appearances. He scored the opening goal in the 2016 Europa League final, although Liverpool eventually lost the game to Sevilla. He featured most often as a substitute in the next seasons under manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp, but was part of the UEFA Champions League-winning squad in 2019. He subsequently had spells with Turkish S\u00fcper Lig club Trabzonspor and Australian A-League club Perth Glory.\nSturridge has represented England at all levels. He made his debut for the senior team against Sweden in November 2011 and was selected for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2016, earning 28 England caps in total. He also represented Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics.",

A year and a half later, he was signed for \u00a310 million by Premier League club Liverpool, who loaned him back to Lille for the 2014\u201315 Ligue 1 season. After struggling at Liverpool due to injuries, and spending a year on loan at VfL Wolfsburg, Origi made various crucial contributions to the club during the 2018\u201319 season. Most notably, he scored two goals, including the winning goal, in the 2019 Champions League semi-final comeback against Barcelona, as well as scoring in the final of the same Champions League season against Tottenham, resulting in Liverpool's latest Champions League trophy. He was also a part of the squad that won the 2019\u201320 Premier League the following season, Liverpool's first league title for 30 years. Due to his loyalty and penchant for scoring goals in big games and in important moments for Liverpool, Origi is recognised as a cult hero at the club. After eight years at Liverpool, Origi was permitted to leave the club, joining AC Milan in Italy on a permanent deal in the 2022 summer transfer window.\nOrigi made his international debut for Belgium in 2014 and was part of their team which reached the quarter-finals of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, during which he became the youngest goalscorer in Belgian World Cup history as a 19 year old.",

After loans with Belgium's Royal Antwerp and the Championship's Wolverhampton Wanderers, he won two League Cups, a Premier League title and the FIFA Club World Cup for United, totalling 60 games and 10 goals. In January 2012, he joined Everton for an undisclosed fee, where his appearances were limited from 2013 due to injury. He signed for Sunderland in January 2017, and left by mutual consent in March 2018. At the end of his professional career, he had spells with Wigan Athletic and Salford City.\nIn 2007, Gibson was at the centre of a dispute between the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) and the Irish Football Association (IFA), after he opted to play for the Republic of Ireland instead of Northern Ireland. The issue was referred to FIFA and was discussed in the Northern Ireland Assembly. The issue was settled in 2010 when it was declared that Northern Ireland-born people are entitled to play for either the Republic or Northern Ireland. Gibson represented the Republic of Ireland at UEFA Euro 2012.",

In 2011, he joined Chelsea in a transfer worth \u00a310 million (\u20ac12 million), but limited playing time resulted in loans to West Bromwich Albion and Everton; in 2014, Lukaku signed with Everton in a then club-record transfer worth \u00a328 million (\u20ac32 million), going on to finish as the league's second-top goalscorer. He subsequently signed with Manchester United in a transfer worth \u00a375 million (\u20ac88 million), but after a breakdown in relations with the club, Lukaku departed for Inter Milan in 2019, in a club-record deal worth \u20ac80 million (\u00a368.1 million), where he won a Serie A title and the Serie A Most Valuable Player award.\nIn 2021, Lukaku returned to Chelsea in a club-record transfer worth \u00a397.5 million (\u20ac115 million), becoming the seventh-most expensive player, the most expensive Belgian player and, at the time, the most expensive player of all time in cumulative transfer fees. However, after one season, he was sent out on loan back to Italy to Inter Milan and Roma. \nBelgium's all-time top goalscorer, Lukaku made his senior international debut in 2010, and has represented his country at five major tournaments: the 2016 and 2020 UEFA European Championships and the 2014, 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups; he finished as joint second-highest goalscorer to win the Bronze Boot in 2018.\n\n",

Its ultimate origin is most likely via the former river Adria from the Venetic and Illyrian word adur, meaning \"sea\" or \"water\".The Adria was until the 8th century BC the main channel of the Po River into the Adriatic Sea but ceased to exist before the 1st century BC. Hecataeus of Miletus (c.550 \u2013 c.476 BC) asserted that both the Etruscan harbor city of Adria and the Adriatic Sea had been named after it. Emperor Hadrian's family was named after the city or region of Adria/Hadria, now Atri, in Picenum, which most likely started as an Etruscan or Greek colony of the older harbor city of the same name.Several saints and six popes have borne this name, including the only English pope, Adrian IV, and the only Dutch pope, Adrian VI. As an English name, it has been in use since the Middle Ages.",

Having made just 20 appearances for Charlton in six years, he moved on to Scottish Premier League side Motherwell in July 2010. He played regularly for Motherwell over three years, then returned to England to join Birmingham City, for whom he missed only one Championship match in two seasons. He signed for West Ham United in 2015 and Middlesbrough two years later.\nIn 2006, Randolph made ten appearances for the Republic of Ireland under-21 side, and a single appearance for the Republic of Ireland B team.

On his league debut for Hull, Snodgrass suffered a serious knee injury that sidelined him for over a year. Hull were relegated in his absence, but Snodgrass helped them gain promotion via the playoffs in 2016. Snodgrass moved to West Ham United in January 2017, and he was loaned to Aston Villa for most of the 2017\u201318 season. Snodgrass left West Ham in January 2021 to sign for West Bromwich Albion, and he then had a short stint with Luton Town.\nAfter playing for Scotland at various youth levels including under-21s, Snodgrass received a call up to the Scotland national team side in 2009, and won his first cap in February 2011.

A final loan spell with Sheffield Wednesday resulted in a permanent move in 2012, where he went on to make 64 appearances and score 12 goals. Nottingham Forest signed him from Wednesday in 2014, where his 16 goals in 50 appearances attracted attention from West Ham United of the Premier League, who signed him in 2015, where he was deployed in a number of positions including right back, right midfielder and as a winger before eventually establishing himself as the club's main striker. On 23 August 2021, he became West Ham United's all-time top scorer in the Premier League.",

        "summary": "Dazet Wilfried Armel Zaha (born 10 November 1992) is a professional footballer who plays as a left winger or a forward for S\u00fcper Lig club Galatasaray and the Ivory Coast national team.\nZaha advanced into the Crystal Palace first team from their academy, in 2010. In his first three full seasons at Selhurst Park, he scored eighteen goals in all competitions. In January 2013, he was transferred to Manchester United for an initial fee of \u00a310 million (the most expensive Crystal Palace player sold at the time). Zaha remained on loan at Palace until the end of the season, helping them return to the Premier League. After an unsuccessful 2013\u201314 season with Manchester United (mostly spent on loan at Cardiff City), Zaha returned to Palace in August 2014 on a season-long loan, before rejoining the club on a permanent basis in February 2015. He went on to play a further eight seasons with the club, becoming their tenth-highest all-time goalscorer, before transferring to Galatasaray in 2023.\nBorn in the Ivory Coast, Zaha grew up in England from age four. He made his debut for the England national team in 2012, appearing in two non-competitive matches (the latter of which came in 2013). After not playing for England for four years, he switched to play for Ivory Coast ahead of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations.\n\n",

He joined FC Seoul, his first club in the 2004 season. Ever since his early debut at the age of 18 for the South Korean side FC Seoul in the 2006 season of K League, Lee has gathered much attention from domestic football fans of South Korea in general, particularly because in South Korean football, where new players mostly make their entrance into professional clubs through a draft system, dropping out of middle school to sign a contract with a top division football club was a very rare case.\nIn January 2009, The Times named Lee as one of the top 50 rising stars in football.",

He moved to Cardiff in January 2013 on a three-and-a-half-year deal, and then Crystal Palace 18 months later.

        "summary": "Kasper Peter Schmeichel (born 5 November 1986) is a Danish professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Belgian Pro League club Anderlecht and the Denmark national team.\nSchmeichel began his career with Manchester City, but had loan spells with Darlington, Bury and Falkirk before he made his first-team debut. Although Schmeichel appeared to have made the City number 1 shirt his own at the start of the 2007\u201308 season, the emergence of Joe Hart resulted in Schmeichel being loaned to Cardiff City. The signing of Republic of Ireland international Shay Given in 2009 meant that Schmeichel fell even further down the pecking order at City, and he was allowed to link up with former manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson at Notts County. He spent only one season with the Magpies as, while it was a very successful one for the club and the player himself, changes to the club's financial position made his departure necessary and his contract was terminated by mutual consent.\nSchmeichel joined Leeds United in 2010, but again, his tenure at the club would only last one season before he was the subject of a transfer to Leicester City, where he would again work under Eriksson. Schmeichel went on to make 479 competitive appearances for Leicester over 11 years, during the most successful era in the club's history, winning the Championship in the 2013\u201314 season, the Premier League in 2015\u201316, FA Cup in 2020\u201321 and the FA Community Shield in 2021.\nSchmeichel played seventeen games for Denmark under-21s. He was called up to the Denmark national team for the first time in 2011, and was part of their squad at UEFA Euro 2012, but did not make his senior debut until 2013. He represented his country at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2020 and 2022 FIFA World Cup.",

He is a three-time Premier League winner and has made the most Premier League appearances (322) by a German player.Huth was signed for Chelsea from the youth system of German club 1. FC Union Berlin in 2001 by Claudio Ranieri. He struggled to establish himself in the Chelsea first team and with the likes of John Terry, William Gallas and Ricardo Carvalho ahead of him in the pecking order at Stamford Bridge, he joined Middlesbrough in August 2006 for a fee of \u00a36 million. He spent three years at the Riverside and after the club was relegated in 2009, Huth signed for Stoke City for a then-club record fee of \u00a35 million.\nAfter a successful 2010\u201311 season for Huth which saw him play in the FA Cup Final, he was named as Stoke's Player of the Year. Under the management of Tony Pulis, Huth remained a vital member of the Stoke squad in 2011\u201312 and 2012\u201313. He also played regularly under Mark Hughes in 2013\u201314 before he suffered a knee injury which ruled him out nearly a year. He was unable to force his way back into the team and he joined Leicester on loan in February 2015, helping them avoid relegation from the top flight. Huth then joined Leicester permanently, helping them to win the Premier League title in 2016.\nHuth was also a German international, earning 19 caps and scoring two goals between 2004 and 2009.

        "summary": "S\u00e9amus John James Given (born 20 April 1976) is an Irish former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest Irish goalkeepers of all time. With 134 caps, he is the second-highest capped Republic of Ireland player. \nGiven started his career at Celtic, however he never made a first-team appearance and he was released by Celtic and signed by Blackburn Rovers on a free transfer in 1994. Given was part of both the Sunderland team who won the Football League First Division title in 1995\u201396 and the Swindon Town team who won the Football League Second Division title that same season, while on loan from Blackburn. He was signed by Newcastle United in 1997 for a fee of \u00a32.5 million, and it was there that he began competing to be a first-choice Premier League goalkeeper. Given was part of the teams who were runners-up in the 1998 and 1999 FA Cup campaigns, and was named in the Premier League Team of the Season for 2001\u201302 and 2005\u201306. He played in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup with Newcastle, and was involved in the club's title challenge in 2001\u201302. Although he submitted a transfer request during the 2000\u201301 campaign after losing his position in the starting line-up, it was denied, and Given went on to regain his place.\nOn 1 February 2009, Given transferred to Manchester City for \u00a36 million on a four-and-a-half-year contract. While Given was at Manchester City, the club qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time in its history after finishing third in the Premier League, as well as winning the FA Cup, though he did not appear in the league in the campaign that City reached the Champions League, nor did he play in the FA Cup. On 18 July 2011, he joined Aston Villa for a fee believed to be around \u00a33.5 million, signing a five-year contract. Given joined Stoke City in July 2015, remaining with the club for two seasons.\nHaving surpassed the total of 100 caps required for membership, he is part of the FIFA Century Club. Given gained his first international cap in 1996 and played in goal during every match for his country during the 2002 FIFA World Cup campaign, helping them reach the knockout stage. He was later on the pitch in Paris when the Republic of Ireland were knocked out of the play-offs for a spot in the 2010 FIFA World Cup by France before helping his team qualify for UEFA Euro 2012. Given played at UEFA Euro 2012 and was selected in Martin O'Neill's 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2016 but didn't appear in any of Ireland's four matches at the tournament. Given is the second-highest capped Republic of Ireland player (after Robbie Keane). He announced his international retirement in July 2016, having amassed 134 caps for his country and kept 52 clean sheets.",

He joined Championship club Stoke City on loan in August 2007 and made an instant impact scoring on his debut against Cardiff City. His good form prompted Stoke to pay Manchester United \u00a31 million in January 2008 to keep him at the Britannia Stadium. He formed a good defensive partnership with Leon Cort as Stoke gained promotion to the Premier League for the first time, ending 23 years away from the top flight.\nDespite making a bad start to Premier League football, Shawcross established himself as first-choice centre-back along with Abdoulaye Faye. Stoke comfortably stayed up, and after another mid-table finish in 2009\u201310, Shawcross was handed the captaincy by manager Tony Pulis ahead of the 2010\u201311 season. With Faye drifting out of the team, Robert Huth became Shawcross's defensive partner and the team reached the 2011 FA Cup Final, finishing runners-up to Manchester City. The run to the final also meant that Stoke entered the UEFA Europa League in 2011\u201312, and they reached the round of 32 losing to Spanish team Valencia. Shawcross continued to be a regular under Pulis in 2012\u201313 and then under Mark Hughes in 2013\u201314 which saw him win the player of the year award. Shawcross remained at Stoke until February 2021, after making 453 appearances over a 14-year period with the club. He ended his career with Inter Miami before retiring from playing in January 2022 and began coaching.",

His early promise saw him make his first-team debut at the age of 17 years and 19 days, breaking the record set by Lionel Messi. In his debut season, he scored 12 goals in 48 matches. In total, he spent four seasons at Camp Nou, scoring 41 goals in 162 games before he was sold in July 2011 to Italian side Roma for a fee of \u20ac12 million.

He spent the 2013\u201314 season on loan at Dutch club Ajax with whom he helped win the Eredivisie title. In July 2014, Bojan joined the English club Stoke City for \u20ac1.8 million.

        "summary": "Peter James Crouch (born 30 January 1981) is an English former professional footballer who played as a striker. He was capped 42 times by the England national team between 2005 and 2010, scoring 22 goals for his country during that time, and appearing at two FIFA World Cup tournaments. He is one of 33 players to have scored 100 or more Premier League goals, and holds the record for the most headed goals in Premier League history. A tall forward, with a slender physique, Crouch was known for his aerial abilities, technical abilities and hold-up play.\nCrouch began his career as a trainee with Tottenham Hotspur. He failed to make an appearance for Spurs and after loan spells at Dulwich Hamlet and Swedish club IFK H\u00e4ssleholm he joined Queens Park Rangers. After QPR were relegated at the end of the 2000\u201301 season, Portsmouth acquired him in a transfer deal worth \u00a31.5 million. He had a strong first season at Fratton Park, and after scoring 19 goals for the club, he joined Aston Villa in March 2002 for \u00a35 million. He had a relatively poor spell at Villa, however, and was loaned out to Norwich City in 2003 before making a move to Southampton, where he regained his form, which would ultimately prompt his joining Liverpool in July 2005. At Liverpool he enjoyed considerable success, winning the FA Cup and FA Community Shield in 2006, and also gaining a runners-up medal in the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final.\nAfter scoring 42 goals in three seasons at Anfield, Portsmouth re-acquired Crouch for \u00a311 million, where he forged an effective partnership with fellow England international Jermain Defoe. He spent just one season in his second spell at Portsmouth and left for Tottenham Hotspur, where he again linked up with Defoe and Harry Redknapp. He scored a vital goal for Tottenham against Manchester City which earned the club a place in the UEFA Champions League. He scored seven goals in ten European matches for Spurs in 2010\u201311, but was unable to replicate this form in the Premier League. He joined Stoke City in August 2011, for a club record fee of \u00a310 million. In his first season with Stoke, he scored 14 goals and won the club's Player of the Year award. He scored eight in 2012\u201313 and ten in both the 2013\u201314 and 2014\u201315 seasons. Crouch spent seven and a half years with Stoke, scoring 62 goals before joining Burnley in January 2019. He retired in July 2019 after the end of his contract.\n\n",

This included a run of 113 consecutive league appearances, the fourth longest streak in Watford's history. Mariappa captained Watford at under-18, reserve and first-team levels, and was the club's vice captain in his final few years at Vicarage Road.\nMariappa accepted his first call up to Jamaica's international team in May 2012. He won his first cap against Guyana later that month, and transferred to Premier League side Reading in July 2012.

However, he was still unable to dislodge Marcus Hahnemann from the starting position, and remained second choice, even going on loan to Southend United in 2008. However, after this loan spell, an injury to Hahnemann gave Federici a prolonged run in the team, and he remained first choice for several seasons. Federici spent ten seasons with the Royals before joining AFC Bournemouth in May 2015. He was used as second and third choice stopper at Dean Court and joined Stoke City in July 2018. He returned to Australia in July 2020, joining Macarthur, where he played for one season before retiring.",

        "summary": "Adam Smith  (baptised 16 June  [O.S. 5 June] 1723 \u2013 17 July 1790) was a Scottish economist and philosopher who was a pioneer in the thinking of political economy and key figure during the Scottish Enlightenment. Seen by some as \"The Father of Economics\" or \"The Father of Capitalism\", he wrote two classic works, The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776). The latter, often abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work that treats economics as a comprehensive system and as an academic discipline. Smith refuses to explain the distribution of wealth and power in terms of God's will and instead appeals to natural, political, social, economic, legal, environmental and technological factors and the interactions between them. Among other economic theories, the work introduced Smith's idea of absolute advantage.Smith studied social philosophy at the University of Glasgow and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot John Snell. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at the University of Edinburgh, leading him to collaborate with David Hume during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow, teaching moral philosophy and during this time, wrote and published The Theory of Moral Sentiments. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day.\nAs a reaction to the common policy of protecting national markets and merchants, what came to be known as mercantilism\u2014nowadays often referred to as \"cronyism\" or \"crony capitalism\"\u2014Smith laid the foundations of classical free market economic theory. The Wealth of Nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he developed the concept of division of labour and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by writers such as Horace Walpole.",

He went on loan to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland to gain first-team experience before making his Manchester United first-team debut in the 2007\u201308 League Cup. He became a regular first-team squad member the following season, playing almost 200 matches for Manchester United and winning three Premier League titles amongst a host of other honours in an eight-year spell; however, he fell out of favour at the club under manager Louis van Gaal and left for West Bromwich Albion in 2015. After West Brom's relegation three years later, Evans signed for Leicester City, with whom he won the FA Cup in 2021. Following Leicester City's relegation in 2023, Evans was released and returned to his former club Manchester United on a one-year contract. \nEvans is the second-most decorated player in Northern Irish football history. He has played over 100 matches for the Northern Ireland national team, and was ever-present in the team's run to the round of 16 at UEFA Euro 2016.\n\n",

        "summary": "Stephen Thomas Ward (19 October 1912 \u2013 3 August 1963) was an English osteopath and artist who was one of the central figures in the 1963 Profumo affair, a British political scandal which brought about the resignation of John Profumo, the Secretary of State for War, and contributed to the defeat of the Conservative government a year later.\nIn 1945, Ward began practising osteopathy in London, and rapidly became quite prominent and fashionable, with many distinguished clients. In his spare time he also studied at the Slade School and developed a talent for sketching portraits which provided a profitable sideline. His practice and his art brought considerable social success, and he made many important friends. Among these was Lord Astor, at whose country house, Cliveden, in the summer of 1961, Ward introduced Profumo to a 19-year-old showgirl and night-club model, Christine Keeler. Profumo, who was married to the actress Valerie Hobson, embarked on a brief affair with Keeler. Most of their assignations took place in Ward's home in Wimpole Mews.\nWard's friendship with the Soviet military attach\u00e9 Yevgeny Ivanov, known by MI5 to be an intelligence officer, drew him to the attention of British intelligence, who sought to use him in an attempt to secure Ivanov's defection. The matter became complicated when, through Ward, Ivanov met Keeler, raising the possibility of a Profumo\u2013Keeler\u2013Ivanov triangle. Profumo ended his relationship with Keeler, which remained largely unsuspected until early in 1963, when the disintegration of Keeler's private life brought matters to public and press attention. Profumo denied any impropriety in a statement to the House of Commons but a few weeks later admitted his affair. He resigned from his ministerial office, parliamentary seat and membership in the Privy Council. Amid a range of rumours of widespread sex scandals in government and high society, the police began to investigate Ward. In June 1963, he was charged with prostitution offences and committed for trial.\nIn the trial, in July 1963, Ward was abandoned by his society friends and exposed to the contempt and hostility of the prosecuting counsel and judge. Despite the relative paucity of evidence and the dismissal of most of the charges against him, he was convicted on two counts of living off the earnings of prostitution. Before the verdict was announced, Ward took an overdose of sleeping pills and died three days later. In 2014, the trial verdict was put under review by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, but in 2017, the commission decided not to refer the case to the Court of Appeal because the original transcript of the judge's summing up could not be found.",

        "summary": "Jeffrey Patrick Hendrick (born 31 January 1992) is an Irish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for EFL Championship club Sheffield Wednesday on loan from Newcastle United, and the Republic of Ireland national team.\nHendrick spent his childhood years with boyhood club St. Kevin's Boys in his native Dublin. He had a number of unsuccessful trials in England before joining Derby County's youth academy in 2008. He made his professional debut in April 2011 after impressive performances with the reserve team led manager Nigel Clough to include him in the senior setup. He quickly became a regular starter and appeared in the 2014 Championship play-off final where Derby missed out on promotion with a 1\u20130 loss to Queens Park Rangers. He amassed a total of 214 appearances and 26 goals for Derby over six years.\nHendrick joined newly-promoted Premier League side, Burnley, in August 2016, signing a three-year deal. He was part of the team that finished in seventh place in the 2017\u201318 season which saw them qualify for the second qualifying round of the following season's Europa League. This was Burnley's first taste of European football in 51 years. Hendrick left Burnley in June 2020, having racked up 139 appearances and 10 goals across four seasons. He joined fellow Premier League club Newcastle United in a free transfer on a four-year deal in August 2020. After finding his playing time severely limited at Newcastle, Hendrick had a short spell on loan at Queens Park Rangers in the second half of the 2021\u201322 season. He spent the following season on loan at Championship side Reading where he suffered relegation for the first time in his career.\nHendrick has represented Ireland at all youth levels. Since his senior international debut in February 2013, he has made over 75 appearances for Ireland and represented them at Euro 2016.\n\n",

He made 269 appearances in the Premier League, including 130 for Manchester City. He was most recently the manager of League One side Bristol Rovers.\nBarton was born and raised in Huyton, Merseyside. He began his football career with Manchester City in 2002 after working his way through their youth system. His appearances in the first team gradually increased over the following five years and he made more than 150 for the club. He earned his only cap for the England national team in February 2007. He joined Newcastle United for a fee of \u00a35.8 million in July 2007. After four years with the club, he joined Queens Park Rangers in August 2011, from where he was loaned to Marseille in 2012. He returned from his loan spell the following season, and helped QPR to promotion to the Premier League via the Championship play-offs. \nQPR were relegated again, and Barton was released at the end of the season. He signed a one-year deal to play for Burnley in 2015, helping them win promotion to the Premier League, but left to join Rangers in May 2016. He was banned from football after admitting a Football Association charge relating to betting in April 2017, and upon its expiry in June 2018 commenced his managerial career with Fleetwood Town.\nBarton's career and life have been marked by numerous controversial incidents and disciplinary problems and he has been convicted twice of violent crimes. On 20 May 2008, he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for common assault and affray during an incident in Liverpool City Centre. Barton served 74 days of this prison term, being released on 28 July 2008. On 1 July 2008, he was also given a four-month suspended sentence after admitting assault occasioning actual bodily harm on former teammate Ousmane Dabo during a training-ground dispute on 1 May 2007. This incident effectively ended his Manchester City career. Barton has been charged with violent conduct three times by The Football Association: for the assault on Dabo, for punching Morten Gamst Pedersen in the stomach, and for attacking three players in the final game of the 2011\u201312 season where he got sent off against Manchester City.\n\n",

Widely regarded as one of the best players of his generation and one of the greatest African players of all time, he is known for his clinical finishing, dribbling and speed.Salah started his senior career in 2010 playing for Al Mokawloon, departing in 2012 to join Basel, where he won two Swiss Super League titles. In 2014, Salah joined Chelsea for a reported fee of \u00a311 million, but limited gametime led to successive loans to Fiorentina and Roma, who later signed him permanently for \u20ac15 million. In the 2016\u201317 season, Salah was a key figure in Roma's unsuccessful title bid, reaching double figures in both goals and assists. In 2017, Salah signed for Liverpool for a then-club record transfer of \u00a336.9 million. In his first season, he set the record for most Premier League goals scored (32) in a 38-game season and helped Liverpool to the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final. Having formed a formidable attacking trio with Roberto Firmino and Sadio Man\u00e9 after the departure of Philippe Coutinho, Salah went on to be an integral player in the club's Champions League and Premier League title successes in the following two seasons, and has since also won the FA Cup, League Cup and FA Community Shield. Salah has achieved numerous individual accolades, including two PFA Players' Player of the Year awards, three Premier League Golden Boots, the Premier League Player of the Season, the Premier League Playmaker of the Season, finished third for the Best FIFA Men's Player in 2018 and 2021, and finished fifth in the 2019 and 2022 FIFA Ballon d'Or. He received the 2018 FIFA Pusk\u00e1s Award for his winning strike in the first Merseyside derby of the 2017\u201318 season. In 2023, Salah became Liverpool's top Premier League goalscorer, surpassing Robbie Fowler.At international level, Salah represented Egypt at youth level before making his senior debut in 2011. Following his performances at the 2012 Summer Olympics, he was named CAF Most Promising African Talent of the Year. Since then, he finished as runner-up in the 2017 and 2021 Africa Cup of Nations and was top scorer during CAF qualification as Egypt qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Salah was named CAF African Footballer of the Year (2017 and 2018), BBC African Footballer of the Year (2017 and 2018), and was selected in the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations Team of the Tournament, 2021 Africa Cup of Nations Team of the Tournament and the CAF Team of the Year on several occasions.\nSalah is regarded as a symbol of national pride in Egypt for his achievements and was named in Time magazine\u2019s list of the 100 most influential people in 2019. Salah has also been credited for raising the profile of Liverpool among Egyptians. To Egyptians, Salah is known as the \"Fourth Pyramid\". Favoured across the Arab world, Salah is often known as the \"Pride of the Arabs\".\n\n",

        "summary": "Patrice Latyr Evra (French pronunciation: [pat\u0281is lati\u0281 ev\u0281a]; born 15 May 1981) is a French former professional footballer. Originally a forward, he primarily played as a left-back. Evra served as captain for both Manchester United and the France national team. His manager Sir Alex Ferguson praised Evra for his leadership, also describing him as one of the best left-backs in Europe.The son of a diplomat, Evra was born in Senegal and arrived in Europe when he was a year old. Evra started his career with Italian club Marsala. The following season, he joined Monza, but returned to France a year later to play for Nice where he was converted into a full-back. In 2002, he joined Monaco and was part of the team that reached the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final. Evra's performances for Monaco culminated in a move to English club Manchester United in January 2006 where he went on to win a collection of trophies including five Premier League titles and a UEFA Champions League. In 2014, he joined Italian side Juventus before moving to Marseille in January 2017; however, he was released in November 2017 after being banned from UEFA competition for seven months for kicking a fan prior to a UEFA Europa League match. Following a short-term contract with West Ham United in February 2018, Evra retired from professional football in July 2019.\nEvra participated in five major international tournaments for France: the 2008, 2012 and 2016 UEFA European Championships, winning a runners-up medal at Euro 2016; and both the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups. Ahead of the 2010 World Cup, Evra was named captain of the national team by manager Raymond Domenech. At the tournament, he appeared in two group matches, although France had a poor campaign that saw the players go on strike after a first-round elimination. The incident resulted in Evra, for his role as captain, being suspended from national team duty for five matches. He returned to the squad and enjoyed a successful 2014 World Cup in Brazil under Didier Deschamps as France reached the quarter-finals.\nEvra was named to the PFA Team of the Year on three occasions and the FIFPro World XI and the UEFA Team of the Year. In France, he was named Ligue 1 Young Player of the Year and included in the Ligue 1 Team of the Year. In September 2019, while completing his professional coaching badges, Evra returned to his former club Manchester United as a trainee coach at the club's academy.\n\n",

Elliot also played for the Republic of Ireland national team.\nElliot began his career with Erith Town, before joining Charlton Athletic's academy side. Whilst at Charlton, he was sent out on loan to Bishop's Stortford and Notts County, and also spent two loan spells at Accrington Stanley, where he was nicknamed \"The Dilsh\". He would then go on to be Charlton's first choice goalkeeper for a number of seasons, until he joined Newcastle United on transfer deadline day in the summer of 2011. Signed mainly as a back-up to Tim Krul, he featured for the club sporadically, but became first choice in the 2015\u201316 season after Krul suffered a season-ending injury.\nThrough the origins of his father's family, Elliot became eligible to represent the Republic of Ireland national football team, and was first called up in 2013, making his debut the following year. Elliot retired from the first team in 2017.In June 2020 Elliot was released by Newcastle United after nine years. In January 2021, Elliot signed for Watford until the end of the 2020\u201321 season. In June 2021, Elliot signed a new 2-year contract with Watford.\n\n",

He also won the 2013 Football League Young Player of the Year Award and was named in the 2012\u201313 PFA Team of the Year.\nIn January 2014, he signed on loan for Premier League club Crystal Palace, for whom he scored his first Premier League goal, and returned to the division permanently at the end of the season, joining Hull City on a free transfer. Ince did not feature regularly for Hull in the 2014\u201315 season, spending time on loan at the end of 2014 with Nottingham Forest before returning briefly to Hull. A loan spell at the end of the season with Derby County was a success, with Ince scoring 11 goals in 18 appearances. At the end of the season, he joined Derby for a fee of \u00a34.75 million, briefly becoming the club's most-expensive signing. Ince spent the 2017\u201318 season with Huddersfield Town before joining Stoke City in July 2018 for a fee of \u00a310million. Ince spent four seasons with Stoke before joining Reading in the summer of 2022.\nInce has been capped internationally for England at under-17, under-19 and under-21 levels.",

On July 2019, Smith Rowe returned to rehab at Arsenal for the first half of the season. In January 2020, Smith Rowe moved to Huddersfield Town on loan, playing a key part in keeping them up in the Championship.\nUpon returning from loan, Smith Rowe established himself as a key player for Arsenal under Mikel Arteta. In July 2021, he was given the number 10 shirt vacated by Mesut \u00d6zil, and signed a long term contract. That following season, Smith Rowe scored ten goals in the league, and was shortlisted for the Premier League Young Player of the Season and the PFA Young Player of the Year awards.Smith Rowe has represented every age bracket for England at youth levels. He made his senior debut against Albania on 12 November 2021, in a 5\u20130 FIFA World Cup qualification victory.\n\n",

        "summary": "Lewis Cass (October 9, 1782 \u2013 June 17, 1866) was an American military officer, politician, and statesman. He represented Michigan in the United States Senate and served in the Cabinets of two U.S. Presidents, Andrew Jackson and James Buchanan. He was also the 1848 Democratic presidential nominee. A slave owner himself, he was a leading spokesman for the doctrine of popular sovereignty, which held that the people in each territory should decide whether to permit slavery.\nBorn in Exeter, New Hampshire, he attended Phillips Exeter Academy before establishing a legal practice in Zanesville, Ohio. After serving in the Ohio House of Representatives, he was appointed as a U.S. Marshal. Cass also joined the Freemasons and would eventually co-found the Grand Lodge of Michigan. He fought at the Battle of the Thames in the War of 1812 and was appointed to govern Michigan Territory in 1813. He negotiated treaties with Native Americans to open land for American settlement and led a survey expedition into the northwest part of the territory.\nCass resigned as governor in 1831 to accept appointment as Secretary of War under Andrew Jackson. As Secretary of War, he helped implement Jackson's policy of Indian removal. After serving as ambassador to France from 1836 to 1842, he unsuccessfully sought the presidential nomination at the 1844 Democratic National Convention; a deadlock between supporters of Cass and former President Martin Van Buren ended with the nomination of James K. Polk. In 1845, the Michigan Legislature elected Cass to the Senate, where he served until 1848. Cass's nomination at the 1848 Democratic National Convention precipitated a split in the party, as Cass's advocacy for popular sovereignty alienated the anti-slavery wing of the party. Van Buren led the Free Soil Party's presidential ticket and appealed to many anti-slavery Democrats, possibly contributing to the victory of Whig nominee Zachary Taylor.\nCass returned to the Senate in 1849 and continued to serve until 1857 when he accepted appointment as the Secretary of State. He unsuccessfully sought to buy land from Mexico and sympathized with American filibusters in Latin America. Cass resigned from the Cabinet in December 1860 in protest of Buchanan's handling of the threatened secession of several Southern states. Since his death in 1866, he has been commemorated in various ways, including with a statue in the National Statuary Hall.",

Two years later, he was transferred to Hibernian, before joining English side Leicester City in January 2011.\nHe was sold to Turkish club Trabzonspor in 2012 for \u00a3750,000 before joining Palermo. However, he was loaned to Leeds United after making only one appearance in six months. He eventually joined Leeds on a permanent deal and was appointed club captain, spending a further year with the club before being released and subsequently joining Cardiff City. In his first full season with Cardiff, he helped the side win promotion to the Premier League.\nBorn in France to Ivorian parents, Bamba represented Ivory Coast in the 2008 Olympic Games and became a regular for the senior national side until his most recent cap in 2014. In 2012, he was part of the side that reached the final of the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\n",

During his stint with Juventus, Cancelo won the league and the Supercoppa Italiana in his first and only season.\nIn 2019, Cancelo was signed by Premier League club Manchester City. He has since won three Premier League titles, the FA Cup, the EFL Cup twice and the UEFA Champions League with the club. In the 2020\u201321 season, he played a significant role in Manchester City reaching their first ever UEFA Champions League final.\nCancelo made his senior debut for Portugal in 2016 after previously being capped by the nations's all youth team levels, winning 75 caps and scoring three goals overall. He was also part of Portugal's under-21 team that reached the 2015 UEFA European Championship Final.

        "summary": "George Herbert Hirst (7 September 1871 \u2013 10 May 1954) was a professional English cricketer who played first-class cricket for Yorkshire County Cricket Club between 1891 and 1921, with a further appearance in 1929.  One of the best all-rounders of his time, Hirst was a left arm medium-fast bowler and right-handed batsman. He played in 24 Test matches for England between 1897 and 1909, touring Australia twice. He completed the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in an English cricket season 14 times, the second most of any cricketer after his contemporary and team-mate Wilfred Rhodes. One of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 1901, Hirst scored 36,356 runs and took 2,742 wickets in first-class cricket. In Tests, he made 790 runs and captured 59 wickets.\nBorn in Kirkheaton, Hirst first achieved success for Yorkshire as a bowler who could bat a little. Over his first few seasons, his batting improved at the expense of his bowling until he was regarded mainly as a specialist batsman. Around 1900, his bowling re-emerged when he discovered a method to make the ball swing in the air after he released it. He was one of the first bowlers to control the swing of the ball, which batsmen found very difficult to counter, making Hirst's bowling far more successful from then on.\nFrom 1903 he achieved 11 consecutive doubles. He set records in 1905, when he scored 341 runs in an innings against Leicestershire\u2014still the highest total for Yorkshire as of 2015\u2014and in 1906, when he completed an unprecedented and unrepeated double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets. In many seasons, he battled injury which reduced his effectiveness, but his bowling remained successful until shortly before the First World War. Hirst played in all England's home Test series between 1899 and 1909, but his record for England was less impressive than his record for Yorkshire, and he may have suffered from playing in Australia where conditions did not suit him.\nHirst returned to play for Yorkshire after the war, but became a cricket coach at Eton College in 1920, where he remained until 1938. After making occasional appearances in 1920 and 1921, he retired from regular first-class cricket. He maintained his connections with Yorkshire for the rest of his life, coached young players and established an excellent reputation for developing players of all social backgrounds. A popular player, coach, and personality with cricketers and spectators, Hirst died in 1954, aged 82.",

It is the second most frequently used given name of ancient Germanic origin. It is also in use as a surname. Another commonly used form of the name is Rupert.\nAfter becoming widely used in Continental Europe, the name entered England in its Old French form Robert, where an Old English cognate form (Hr\u0113odb\u0113orht, Hrodberht, Hr\u0113odb\u0113or\u00f0, Hr\u0153db\u0153r\u00f0, Hr\u0153dber\u00f0, Hr\u014d\u00f0ber\u03c7t\u0155) had existed before the Norman Conquest. The feminine version is Roberta. The Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish form is Roberto.\nRobert is also a common name in many Germanic languages, including English, German, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish, Scots, Danish, and Icelandic. It can be used as a French, Polish, Irish, Finnish, Romanian, and Estonian name as well.\n\n",

He signed for Villarreal in 2002, winning the UEFA Intertoto Cup twice. Reina moved on to Liverpool and made his debut in the 2005 UEFA Super Cup, which Liverpool won. He instantly became first-choice goalkeeper and went on to win both the FA Cup \u2013 where he saved three out of four West Ham United penalties in the final \u2013 and the FA Community Shield. In 2007, he reached the Champions League Final with Liverpool, matching the feat achieved by his father in 1974, but Liverpool lost to AC Milan.\nFollowing eight consecutive seasons as Liverpool's first-choice keeper, Reina spent the 2013\u201314 season on loan at Napoli, where he was reunited with Rafael Ben\u00edtez, the coach who signed him to play for Liverpool in 2005. During his loan tenure in Naples, Reina was part of the side that won the Coppa Italia in 2014. Reina then completed a permanent move to Bayern Munich in 2014, where he was the second-choice keeper for behind Manuel Neuer. Reina returned to Napoli on a permanent deal in 2015, where he remained until 2018 when he signed for Milan. In January 2020, he completed a loan move to Aston Villa, before returning to Serie A with Lazio in August 2020.\nAt international level, Reina played for Spain's youth team, winning the UEFA European Under-17 Championship in 1999. He made his senior debut in 2005, and has generally been selected as the second-choice keeper behind Iker Casillas and David de Gea. He was part of the Spain squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and made one appearance in their victorious UEFA Euro 2008 campaign, earning him his first international honour. He was later part of the Spain squads that won their first ever World Cup in 2010 and their third UEFA European Championship in 2012, as well as featuring at the 2014 and 2018 World Cups.\nReina has made the 4th highest number of appearances by a Spanish player in the Premier League, with more than 200 appearances in just his first five seasons, 108 of the 219 appearances being clean sheets. In the 2010\u201311 season, he kept his 100th Premier League clean sheet for Liverpool in a 3\u20130 win against Aston Villa.\n\n",

His nickname is taken from the French former footballer David Trezeguet, after his former youth coach noticed similarities between the pair in playing style and appearance.\nHe began his career with Al Ahly, breaking into the first team at the age of 18 and helping them win the 2012 CAF Champions League and 2013 CAF Champions League. In 2015, he joined Belgian team Anderlecht and the move was later made permanent. However, he struggled to establish himself in the first team and spent the following two seasons on loan, first with fellow Belgian side Mouscron and later Turkish side Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa. With Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa, he became the highest scoring Egyptian player in the Turkish top flight in a single season which prompted the club to make the transfer permanent in 2018.\nHaving represented Egypt at under-20 and under-23 level, Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet made his full debut for the Egyptian senior side in 2014 at the age of 19 in a friendly against Kenya.

Dunne was also a dual internationalist and played for both Ireland teams: the FAI XI and the IFA XI.\nDunne was the first Irishman to figure prominently in the English League scoring records. In the 1930\u201331 season he scored 41 league goals for Sheffield United. This became a club record and remains the most league goals scored by an Irishman during a single English League season.\nIn the 1931\u201332 season, he scored in 12 consecutive matches, a record until Stan Mortensen scored in 15 for Blackpool in the 1950\u201351 season. Dunne also scored 30 or more First Division goals in three consecutive seasons between 1930 and 1933. He excelled at either centre forward or inside forward and was outstanding with his head. On 27 September 1930, he scored a hat-trick of headers against Portsmouth. He was a fringe member of the great Arsenal side of the 1930s before spending a season at Southampton and then finishing his career at Shamrock Rovers.\nDunne died suddenly from a heart attack, at the age of 44, on 14 November 1949. His two sons, Tommy and Jimmy, also played in the League of Ireland for St. Patrick's Athletic. Tommy also played for Shamrock Rovers. His nephew, another Tommy Dunne, also played for Rovers and another nephew Christy Doyle, played for Shelbourne and the Republic of Ireland.",

Born in France, he plays for the Senegal national team.\nStarting his career in his native France, Mendy played in the Le Havre academy before signing professional terms with third division Cherbourg in 2011. Mendy was released in 2014, after which he almost quit football, before getting an opportunity with Marseille's reserves. He established himself as regular in the following seasons at Reims and Rennes.\nIn 2020, Mendy signed for Premier League club Chelsea for a reported fee of \u00a322 million. In his first season, he immediately broke into the starting line-up, becoming the first African goalkeeper to play for the club's senior team, and kept sixteen clean sheets in the Premier League. Mendy also equalled the record for the most clean sheets in a UEFA Champions League season with nine, and kept another clean sheet in the final to help Chelsea win their second title. He was also awarded both the UEFA Goalkeeper of the Year and The Best FIFA Goalkeeper of 2021, becoming the first African goalkeeper in football's history to win both awards. He would continue as the first choice keeper in the 2021\u201322 season, before subsequently falling out of favour during 2022\u201323. In 2023, Mendy signed for Saudi Pro League club Al-Ahli for a fee of around \u00a316 million.\nEligible to play for Guinea-Bissau and Senegal through descent and France through birth, Mendy initially joined Guinea-Bissau in honour of his father. However, he subsequently switched allegiance to Senegal, where he became the first-choice goalkeeper for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, helping Senegal to a runners-up finish. He helped his nation win the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, while also being named the tournament's best goalkeeper, keeping a clean sheet in the final.",

Widely regarded as one of the greatest defenders of his generation, he is known for his defensive prowess, discipline, and leadership.Silva began his senior club career in 2002 playing as a midfielder for RS Futebol, and transitioned to a defensive position while at Juventude; he then signed with Porto in 2004, at age 19, and moved to Dynamo Moscow on loan, where he was hospitalized with a near fatal bout of tuberculosis. After recovering, he joined Fluminense and won a Copa do Brasil. In 2009, Silva moved to AC Milan for a reported fee of \u20ac8 million and won the 2010\u201311 Serie A title.\nIn 2012, Silva was the subject of a then-record association football deal when he signed for Paris Saint-Germain in a transfer worth up to \u20ac42 million, becoming the most expensive defender ever at the time. There, he would become the club's longest serving captain, winning seven Ligue 1 titles, six Coupes de la Ligue, five Coupes de France, and playing in the final of the UEFA Champions League, which served as his last PSG appearance. He currently ranks eighth in all-time appearances for the club. In 2020, the 36-year-old Silva joined Chelsea on a free transfer, winning the Champions League in his first season, and both the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup in his second.\nSilva made his senior international debut for Brazil in 2008 at age 23, and has since received over 110 caps, including appearances in eight major tournaments.

        "summary": "Hannibal (; Punic: \ud802\udd07\ud802\udd0d\ud802\udd01\ud802\udd0f\ud802\udd0b, romanized: \u1e24ann\u012bba\u02bfl; 247 \u2013 between 183 and 181 BC) was a Carthaginian general and statesman who commanded the forces of Carthage in their battle against the Roman Republic during the Second Punic War.\nHannibal's father, Hamilcar Barca, was a leading Carthaginian general during the First Punic War. His younger brothers were Mago and Hasdrubal; his brother-in-law was Hasdrubal the Fair, who commanded other Carthaginian armies. Hannibal lived during a period of great tension in the Mediterranean Basin, triggered by the emergence of the Roman Republic as a great power with its defeat of Carthage in the First Punic War. Revanchism prevailed in Carthage, symbolized by the pledge that Hannibal made to his father to \"never be a friend of Rome\".\nIn 218 BC, Hannibal attacked Saguntum (modern Sagunto, Spain), an ally of Rome, in Hispania, sparking the Second Punic War. Hannibal invaded Italy by crossing the Alps with North African war elephants. In his first few years in Italy, he won a succession of victories at the Battle of the Trebia, Lake Trasimene, and Cannae, inflicting heavy losses on the Romans. Hannibal was distinguished for his ability to determine both his and his opponent's respective strengths and weaknesses, and to plan battles accordingly. His well-planned strategies allowed him to conquer and ally with several Italian cities that were previously allied to Rome. Hannibal occupied most of southern Italy for 15 years. The Romans, led by Fabius Maximus, avoided directly engaging  him, instead waging a war of attrition. Carthaginian defeats in Hispania prevented Hannibal from being reinforced, and he was unable to win a decisive victory. A counter-invasion of North Africa, led by Roman General Scipio Africanus, forced him to return to Carthage. Hannibal was eventually defeated at the Battle of Zama, ending the war in a Roman victory.\nAfter the war, Hannibal successfully ran for the office of sufet. He enacted political and financial reforms to enable the payment of the war indemnity imposed by Rome. Those reforms were unpopular with members of the Carthaginian aristocracy and in Rome, and he fled into voluntary exile. During this time, he lived at the Seleucid court, where he acted as military advisor to Antiochus III the Great in his war against Rome. Antiochus met defeat at the Battle of Magnesia and was forced to accept Rome's terms, and Hannibal fled again, making a stop in the Kingdom of Armenia. His flight ended in the court of Bithynia. He was betrayed to the Romans and committed suicide by poisoning himself.\nHannibal is considered one of the greatest military tacticians and generals of antiquity, alongside Philip of Macedon, Alexander the Great, Leonidas, Cyrus the Great, Julius Caesar,  Scipio Africanus and Pyrrhus. According to Plutarch, Scipio asked Hannibal \"who the greatest general was\", to which Hannibal replied \"either Alexander or Pyrrhus, then himself\".\n\n",

He is nicknamed El Matador (\"The Killer\") or Cazador (\"Hunter\") for his clinical finishing as well as his celebration, in which he makes a gesture resembling a bow and arrow. Cavani is considered one of the best strikers of his generation and one of Uruguay's greatest ever players.\nCavani began his career playing for Danubio in Montevideo, where he played for two years, before moving to Italian side Palermo in 2007. In 2010, Cavani signed for Napoli, who signed him on an initial loan deal before buying him for a total fee of \u20ac17 million. He helped them win the Coppa Italia in 2012 and established himself as the most dominant striker in Serie A. In mid-2013, Cavani joined Paris Saint-Germain in France for a reported \u20ac64 million, at the time the most expensive signing in French football history. With PSG, Cavani won six Ligue 1 titles, five Coupes de la Ligue and four Coupes de France. He also ranks as the club's second all-time top goalscorer. In 2020, Cavani signed with Manchester United, scoring 17 goals in his first season, including a goal in the UEFA Europa League final, before signing for Valencia in 2022.\nCavani scored on his Uruguay debut against Colombia in 2008, and has since then earned 136 caps and scored 58 international goals, only behind strike partner Luis Su\u00e1rez among Uruguayan internationals. He has participated in ten major international tournaments: four FIFA World Cups (2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022), five Copas Am\u00e9rica (2011, 2015, 2016, 2019 and 2021), and one FIFA Confederations Cup (2013). Cavani scored at the 2010 World Cup to help Uruguay to fourth place in the tournament, and in 2011 was part of the Uruguay squad that won a record fifteenth Copa Am\u00e9rica title. He finished as the CONMEBOL 2018 World Cup qualification top scorer with ten goals.\nDuring his time in Serie A, Cavani was named in the Serie A Team of the Year three times and was Serie A top scorer in the 2012\u201313 season. During his time in Ligue 1, he was named in the UNFP Ligue 1 Team of the Year three times, was awarded Ligue 1 Player of the Year for the 2016\u201317 season, and was the league's top scorer in the 2016\u201317 and 2017\u201318 seasons.

        "summary": "Gareth Frank Bale  (born 16 July 1989) is a Welsh former professional footballer who played as a winger, most notably for Tottenham Hotspur, Real Madrid and Wales. He is widely regarded as one of the best footballers of his generation and one of the greatest Welsh players of all time. He was best known for his explosive pace, athleticism, and powerful strikes from distance.\nBale began his professional career at Southampton, playing at left-back before moving to Tottenham in 2007. From the 2009\u201310 season, under the guidance of Harry Redknapp, Bale became an integral part of the team and transformed into a winger. He went on to receive several individual honours, including two PFA Players' Player of the Year awards and three PFA Team of the Year inclusions. In September 2013, Real Madrid signed Bale for a then world-record transfer fee of \u00a385.1 million (\u20ac100.8 million). Being part of the subsequent trio dubbed BBC, alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, Bale helped the club to win the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, scoring in both finals.  \nAlthough Bale experienced a decrease in game time from 2015 onwards due to continual injuries, he was amongst the top three nominees for the 2015-16 UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award, scored an overhead kick in Real Madrid's 2018 UEFA Champions League Final victory, and was awarded the FIFA Club World Cup Golden Ball in 2018. In 2020\u201321, he returned to Tottenham on loan, before playing his final season in Madrid. In his nine-year tenure, Bale won 15 trophies, including three La Liga titles and five Champions Leagues. He joined MLS club Los Angeles FC in July 2022 before retiring in January 2023, aged 33. \nBale made his senior international debut for Wales in May 2006, becoming the youngest player at that point to represent the nation. He then went on to earn 111 caps and scored 41 international goals, making him Wales' most capped player and top goalscorer of all time. He was the top scorer for Wales in their successful qualifying campaign for UEFA Euro 2016, scoring seven times; he subsequently represented Wales in the final tournament as they reached the semi-finals, scoring three goals. He later featured for the side at Euro 2020 and was pivotal in Wales' qualifying for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, ending a 64-year appearance drought at the World Cup. He was named Welsh Footballer of the Year a record six times.",

        "summary": "Mbaye Diagne (18 March 1958 \u2013 31 May 1994) was a Senegalese military officer who served in Rwanda as a United Nations military observer from 1993 to 1994. During the Rwandan genocide he undertook many missions on his own initiative to save the lives of civilians.\nDiagne was born in Senegal. After graduating from the University of Dakar he enrolled in the Senegalese Army's \u00c9cole Nationale des Officiers d'Active. He completed his schooling the following year and eventually attained the rank of captain. He was given command of the 3rd Company of the 6th Infantry Battalion and fought in the Casamance conflict from 1989 to 1993.\nThat year Diagne was sent to Rwanda as part of an Organisation of African Unity military observer team tasked with monitoring the Rwandan Civil War, a conflict fought between the Hutu-dominated government and the Tutsi-led Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF). Later he was assigned to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), a UN peacekeeping force meant to oversee the implementation of the Arusha Accords\u2014a peace agreement designed to end the war. In April 1994 the President of Rwanda was killed. Hutu extremists initiated the Rwandan genocide, targeting members of the Tutsi ethnic minority. They murdered moderate Hutu Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, and Diagne rescued her children and secured them safe passage out of the country. He then undertook numerous missions on his own around Kigali in violation of the UN's rules of engagement, hiding Tutsis in his car and evacuating them to UN installations. He also protected some Hutus and worked to safeguard the Senegalese expatriate community. Various estimates exist for the number of lives Diagne saved, ranging as high as over 1,000.\nOn 31 May 1994 Diagne was killed when a mortar shell launched by RPF forces exploded near his car while he was stopped at a government checkpoint. His death led the UN to suspend relief operations in Kigali. His body was repatriated to Senegal and buried with full military honours. In 2005 Diagne was posthumously awarded the rank of Knight in Senegal's National Order of the Lion. The UN Security Council created the Captain Mbaye Diagne Medal for Exceptional Courage in 2014 in his honour.",

        "summary": "Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro  (Portuguese pronunciation: [k\u027ei\u0283\u02c8tj\u0250nu \u0281\u0254\u02c8naldu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards, a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards, and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 34 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (128) and international appearances (205). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 850 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time.\nRonaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth \u20ac94 million (\u00a380 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including La D\u00e9cima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial \u20ac100 million (\u00a388 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.\nRonaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned more than 200 caps, making him both the country and history's most-capped player of all time, recognised by the Guinness World Records. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the sports all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.\nOne of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016, 2017, and 2023, and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career.",

        "summary": "Aaron James Ramsey (born 26 December 1990) is a Welsh professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for EFL Championship club Cardiff City and captains the Wales national team. Ramsey mainly plays as a box-to-box midfielder, but has also been deployed on the left and right wings.\nHe played as a schoolboy for Cardiff City, where he spent eight years in youth football, became the club's youngest ever first team player, and made 28 appearances (including loan spell) for the senior team \u2013 including the 2008 FA Cup Final. Ramsey moved to Arsenal in 2008 in a \u00a35 million deal, where he quickly gained first-team experience. However, his career stalled significantly after he suffered a broken leg in a match against Stoke City in February 2010. After two loan spells away from Arsenal, he returned to full fitness and re-established himself as a regular starter during the 2011\u201312 season. He also represented Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Ramsey was a key player for Arsenal in the 2013\u201314 campaign, scoring 16 goals in all competitions, including the winner in the 2014 FA Cup Final against Hull City. He also played in the 2015 FA Cup Final, which Arsenal won, and scored a second FA Cup winning goal in 2017. On 1 July 2019, he joined Juventus after having signed a pre-contractual agreement, winning the league title during his first season. In 2022, he joined French side Nice. On the 15 July 2023, Ramsey re-joined Cardiff City after his contract with Nice was terminated by mutual consent.\nRamsey made his full international debut for Wales in 2008 and was part of their UEFA Euro 2016 campaign, where he helped his country to the semi-finals and was included in the Team of the Tournament. He was instrumental in securing qualification for UEFA Euro 2020, the country's second successive European tournament, and at the delayed tournament, Wales made it to the last 16. Ramsey was also a member of the squad that qualified for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, becoming the first team to do so since 1958, which he described as a \"dream come true\".",

In June 2018 the developers announced that since TrueOS had become the core OS to provide a basis for other projects, the graphical installer had been removed. Graphical end-user-orientated OSes formerly based on TrueOS were GhostBSD and Trident. TrueOS provided official binary Nvidia and Intel drivers for hardware acceleration and an optional 3D desktop interface through KWin, and Wine is ready-to-use for running Microsoft Windows software. TrueOS was also able to run Linux software in addition to FreeBSD Ports collection and it had its own .txz package manager. TrueOS supported OpenZFS and the installer offered disk encryption with geli.\nDevelopment of TrueOS ended in 2020.",

        "summary": "Matthew Bevan \"Matt\" Cox (born July 2, 1969) is an American former mortgage broker and admitted mortgage fraudster. Cox, also a true crime author, wrote an unpublished manuscript entitled The Associates in which the main character traveled the country to perpetrate a mortgage fraud scheme similar to the one Cox ran.\nCox falsified documents to make it appear that he owned properties, and then fraudulently obtained several mortgages on them for five to six times their actual worth. He acquired millions of dollars this way; estimates report the amount at between US$5 and $25 million. Cox's first conviction occurred in 2002 when he was sentenced to probation for mortgage fraud. He was then fired from the mortgage broker position he held in a Tampa, Florida area firm. He began his life as a dedicated criminal in central Florida after that offense, before fleeing the area when his activities were discovered. His crime spree continued across the southern and southwestern United States, eventually landing him on the United States Secret Service's Most Wanted list. He was aided by several female accomplices, some of whom are in prison or have served time there for their participation in his fraudulent mortgage practices. Cox was arrested on November 16, 2006. Indicted on 42 counts, and facing prison sentences of up to 125 years, he plea bargained his sentence down to a maximum of 54 years on April 11, 2007, and was sentenced to 26 years on November 17, 2006. He was released from prison in July 2019.\nHis story is well chronicled and has been featured on Dateline NBC, CNBC's American Greed, in Fortune magazine, Bloomberg Businessweek, Playboy magazine, and other media outlets.\n\n",

With Marseille, he won his first senior trophy, the Coupe de la Ligue in the 2011\u201312 season. In 2016, he left Marseille for Lyon, but after a disappointing year he left to join Italian club Torino, initially on loan but later on a permanent basis. Though initially impressing, he fell out of favour, and left the club in 2021, before signing for English club Watford\nInternationally, Nkoulou played 75 times for Cameroon between 2008 and 2017, and decided to retire shortly after winning the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations, scoring the equalising goal in the final. He represented Cameroon in two World Cups and three Africa Cup of Nations. In September 2022, he was called up to the national team for the first time after 5 years.\n\n",

        "summary": "Kieffer Roberto Francisco Moore (born 8 August 1992) is a professional footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club Bournemouth and the Wales national team.\nMoore started his career with Conference South club Truro City, having as a teen been a part of Torquay United's youth system and playing for South Devon League Division Two club Paignton Saints. Moore joined Dorchester Town in February 2013 due to Truro's continued financial difficulties, and he finished his first season in the Conference South with 20 goals. His goal-scoring record brought him to the attention of Yeovil Town for whom he signed in July 2013.\nAfter making more than fifty appearances for Yeovil, Moore was released and had a brief spell with Norwegian club Viking before returning to English football with Forest Green Rovers. Moore had a loan spell back at his hometown club Torquay United where he scored five goals in four games, grabbing the attention of Championship club Ipswich Town, signing for the club in January 2017. Before the beginning of the 2017\u201318 season, Moore signed on loan for Rotherham United for whom he scored 13 goals in 20 matches. His form saw him recalled by Ipswich in January 2018, and he subsequently joined fellow Championship club Barnsley for an undisclosed fee.\nBorn in England, Moore played once for their non-league select team in 2016 but was eligible for Wales, Italy and China through ancestral affiliations, before making his senior debut for Wales in 2019; he was selected subsequently for the Welsh UEFA Euro 2020 finals squad and scored on his first appearance at the tournament. Moore also helped Wales qualify for the FIFA World Cup in 2022 for the first time since 1958.\n\n",
