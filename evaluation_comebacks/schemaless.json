It stifled the energetic style that  Jurgen Klopp 's team have become renowned for. \n A Liverpool win this weekend would leave Man City nine points behind in the race for the title, so with so much at stake we could witness another watchful performance from the title-holders. \n Taming Liverpool’s aggression \n Guardiola knows Liverpool are ferocious opponents, especially on home turf. \n Aggressive in the way they press and win tackles inside the opposition half, it is vital for all visiting sides to focus hard on not losing the ball in bad areas. \n Many opponents struggle to handle them on Merseyside. \n When you consider Liverpool average 60.8 per cent possession in matches at Anfield, their ball-winning stats are incredibly impressive. \n For a side who have so much of the ball, they also win it back with high levels of efficiency. \n Home matches this season \n \n \n \n Most poss. won final third \n Most tackles won \n \n \n \n \n Liverpool \n 41 \n Everton \n 79 \n \n \n Southampton \n 39 \n Brighton \n 68 \n \n \n Man City \n 37 \n Liverpool \n 66 \n \n \n Crystal Palace \n Sheff Utd \n \n \n Arsenal \n Leicester \n \n \n \n So Man City will aim to take away this strength of their opponents. \n Last season they were relatively risk-free in their choice of distribution and showed wonderful discipline in their choice of pass. \n It will be fascinating to see if one of the world’s most adventurous passing sides can again replicate that tactic. \n The side to watch \n Important duels will take place all over the pitch but one specific area draws extra interest. \n With the attack-minded  Benjamin Mendy  or rare starter  Angelino  the options for Man City at left-back, I anticipate Liverpool targeting that position as a possible weakness. \n Coupled with that,  Trent Alexander-Arnold  and  Jordan Henderson  have been dominant working in tandem down the Reds' right in recent outings. \n With  Mohamed Salah  drifting inside, the England team-mates pushed forward with force in back-to-back comeback wins over  Aston Villa  and  Tottenham Hotspur . \n Considering he is a right-back, it is exceptional that across the last 180 minutes of top-flight action Alexander-Arnold has made 38 more entries to the penalty area than any other Liverpool player. \n Together, he and Henderson have been excellent.   \n If they impose themselves in a similar way this weekend, it could make the difference. \n Liverpool's last two matches \n \n \n \n Most penalty-area entries \n Most open-play crosses \n \n \n \n \n Alexander-Arnold \n 56 \n Alexander-Arnold \n 22 \n \n \n Henderson \n 18 \n Henderson \n 10 \n \n \n Mane \n 12 \n Robertson \n \n \n Robertson \n 9 \n Mane \n 8 \n \n \n Fabinho \n 7 \n Firmino \n 2 \n \n \n \n Will the Reds apply the handbrake? \n There is one caveat to consider, and that is Man City's own strength down that side of the pitch. \n David Silva  and  Raheem Sterling  have both been in exceptional form themselves. \n If the former is passed fit then their twin threat could curtail Alexander-Arnold and Henderson's ambition in attack. \n If they take unnecessary risks and holes appear for City's talismen to hurt them on the break, it could spell trouble. \n Keep your eye on where Alexander-Arnold and Henderson take the majority of their touches at Anfield this Sunday. \n If it is in the middle third that will be a sign of how well Guardiola's game plan is working. \n Also in this series  \n Part 1:  Burn at the heart of Potter's Brighton revolution Part 2:  Kovacic aiming to maintain influence in Jorginho's absence Part 3:  Arsenal need settled system to keep pace with Leicester \n",

It stifled the energetic style that  Jurgen Klopp 's team have become renowned for. \n A Liverpool win this weekend would leave Man City nine points behind in the race for the title, so with so much at stake we could witness another watchful performance from the title-holders. \n Taming Liverpool’s aggression \n Guardiola knows Liverpool are ferocious opponents, especially on home turf. \n Aggressive in the way they press and win tackles inside the opposition half, it is vital for all visiting sides to focus hard on not losing the ball in bad areas. \n Many opponents struggle to handle them on Merseyside. \n When you consider Liverpool average 60.8 per cent possession in matches at Anfield, their ball-winning stats are incredibly impressive. \n For a side who have so much of the ball, they also win it back with high levels of efficiency. \n Home matches this season \n \n \n \n Most poss. won final third \n Most tackles won \n \n \n \n \n Liverpool \n 41 \n Everton \n 79 \n \n \n Southampton \n 39 \n Brighton \n 68 \n \n \n Man City \n 37 \n Liverpool \n 66 \n \n \n Crystal Palace \n Sheff Utd \n \n \n Arsenal \n Leicester \n \n \n \n So Man City will aim to take away this strength of their opponents. \n Last season they were relatively risk-free in their choice of distribution and showed wonderful discipline in their choice of pass. \n It will be fascinating to see if one of the world’s most adventurous passing sides can again replicate that tactic. \n The side to watch \n Important duels will take place all over the pitch but one specific area draws extra interest. \n With the attack-minded  Benjamin Mendy  or rare starter  Angelino  the options for Man City at left-back, I anticipate Liverpool targeting that position as a possible weakness. \n Coupled with that,  Trent Alexander-Arnold  and  Jordan Henderson  have been dominant working in tandem down the Reds' right in recent outings. \n With  Mohamed Salah  drifting inside, the England team-mates pushed forward with force in back-to-back comeback wins over  Aston Villa  and  Tottenham Hotspur . \n Considering he is a right-back, it is exceptional that across the last 180 minutes of top-flight action Alexander-Arnold has made 38 more entries to the penalty area than any other Liverpool player. \n Together, he and Henderson have been excellent.   \n If they impose themselves in a similar way this weekend, it could make the difference. \n Liverpool's last two matches \n \n \n \n Most penalty-area entries \n Most open-play crosses \n \n \n \n \n Alexander-Arnold \n 56 \n Alexander-Arnold \n 22 \n \n \n Henderson \n 18 \n Henderson \n 10 \n \n \n Mane \n 12 \n Robertson \n \n \n Robertson \n 9 \n Mane \n 8 \n \n \n Fabinho \n 7 \n Firmino \n 2 \n \n \n \n Will the Reds apply the handbrake? \n There is one caveat to consider, and that is Man City's own strength down that side of the pitch. \n David Silva  and  Raheem Sterling  have both been in exceptional form themselves. \n If the former is passed fit then their twin threat could curtail Alexander-Arnold and Henderson's ambition in attack. \n If they take unnecessary risks and holes appear for City's talismen to hurt them on the break, it could spell trouble. \n Keep your eye on where Alexander-Arnold and Henderson take the majority of their touches at Anfield this Sunday. \n If it is in the middle third that will be a sign of how well Guardiola's game plan is working. \n Also in this series  \n Part 1:  Burn at the heart of Potter's Brighton revolution Part 2:  Kovacic aiming to maintain influence in Jorginho's absence Part 3:  Arsenal need settled system to keep pace with Leicester \n",
